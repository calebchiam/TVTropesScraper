{"MyWayOrTheHighway": "A character is offered an uncomfortable, non-negotiable choice that boils down to two options:\nUnlike The Easy Way or the Hard Way, there is no threat of coersion or violence; it may instead carry an implication that the person being offered this choice is expendable.\nThe favored Catch-Phrase of the Control Freak, but may also be used by an older character to teach discipline, such as from a parent to their child (i.e. \"My House, My Rules\") or from a drill sergeant to a fresh recruit.\n"}
{"ArbitraryHeadcountLimit": "Trope common in Real-Time Strategy games, in which the overall number of units or the count of a particular powerful, but not unique unit are limited by assigning a completely arbitrary Cap to them. This limit is often far lower than what the resources available or the technical limits of the game engine could allow. Particularly ridiculous when the rule can be broken through scenario design or using a perfectly legitimate game feature. Most often implemented as a way to enforce game balance.\nIt may be hardware related. Doing rendering, AI, collision, etc. for many units at once can slow a game down, particularly on high graphics settings, resulting in a need to limit how many units the player may have at any given time. Since developers have to take console hardware limitations into account, or multiple PC configurations, they will usually try to balance between gameplay and allowing the game to still run smoothly.\nMany Role Playing Games have this as well, centered around the three-to-six-person size of the active party\u2014see Player Character Calculus for additional classification. In addition to the Hand Wave explanations common in Real-Time Strategy games, Role Playing Games can use the plot to explain the size limit. For example, in Final Fantasy IV, every time it looks like the party will grow beyond five, one of your current members will discover pressing business elsewhere. Or die. Or betray you.\nSee also Cap and You Require More Vespene Gas. Kind of related to Conservation of Ninjutsu, Serendipity Writes the Plot, and Construct Additional Pylons. When applied to temporary things like active bullets, it's One Bullet at a Time.\n"}
{"PlotDeviceAllAlong": "Perhaps the mech has a mode inaccessible by the pilot until a specific password is entered. Perhaps the inter-dimensional portal that the characters use for rapid transit is actually a doorway to Hell. Perhaps a certain magic ring can do more than make one invisible.\nOften the thing in question was being used by the character in a mundane or straightforward way when untapped potential lay hidden within. Typically that potential is revealed in a surprising way, often by a villain but not always.\nAt the time that the work is taking place the thing is being used with some regularity, it's just that the current owner/holder is unaware of the thing's other, loftier or more powerful abilities. To clarify, the thing in question serves a purpose outside of its \"special\" abilities or traits. The sword was being swung, the gun was being fired, and the artifact was being worn for a practical/useful purpose prior to The Reveal. The reader/viewer is usually unaware of the \"true\" purpose of the thing, but the character is ALWAYS unaware.\nA Super Trope to Unholy Holy Sword.\nA Sister Trope to Chekhov's Gun, Excalibur in the Rust (where the thing has been unused prior to The Reveal), Chekhov's Boomerang (where the thing is used infrequently, or once and forgotten about then used again, and there's no Reveal).\nCompare Plot Coupon (when obtaining the thing is part of the work's narrative), Cerebus Retcon (which is what the thing becomes retroactively), and Sword of Plot Advancement (where the thing is obtained late in the narrative of the work).\nPlot Coupon That Does Something is similar to this trope, but the focus is different \u2014 in that trope, the \"plot device\" use is known ahead of time, with the secondary use being a bonus; in this one, the significance is discovered later. It's the difference between the Holy Grail having a helpful effect of healing the bearer, versus your handy Magic Healing Cup turning out to be the Holy Grail.\nContrast MacGuffin (which serves no useful purpose).\n"}
{"AllBeerIsAle": "In fantasy fiction, whenever a character is drinking beer, the beer will always be an ale rather than a lager. You can read about the difference elsewhere.\nThere are a number of possible explanations for this. The difference between styles of beer isn't as immediately obvious or as much discussed as the difference between styles of wine. The word ale sounds old-fashioned, and many people assume it's simply an old-fashioned word for beer.note\u00a0Which it originally was; \"Ale\" is Old English, from at least AD 900; \"beer\", borrowed from the German, was usually restricted to poetic uses until after c.1500, when it was repurposed to indicate hopped beer, and later all beer.\nMedieval Europe (or something very much like it) is a common setting for fantasy stories, and the typical Medieval European beer would have been an ale. Lager wasn't even invented until the fifteenth or sixteenth century; the process was serendipitously discovered when some ale casks stored in cold caves in Germany tasted like something else, and the actual yeast required for making it might have been accidentally brought from South America (!). Most of it was probably \"small beer,\" an unfiltered, low-alcohol beer that people drank instead of water because of the prevalence of waterborne disease.\nMany fantasy tropes are taken from the very, very, British The Lord of the Rings, and the vast majority of British beers actually are ales\u2014again, lager is a German wordnote\u00a0meaning, in this context, \"store\" or \"warehouse\" for a German invention, and it wasn't until relatively recently that lager spread outside Germany, broader Central Europe and the Americas. (This is where German and other Central European brewers settled in the 19th century\u2014why do you think all of the Americas from Argentina and Chile to Canada and Alaska drink lager?)\nCompare Uncoffee where coffee goes under another name or actually is something else. See also The Need for Mead (where, despite the name, ale is more likely to be the drink of choice than actual mead).\n"}
{"ExtendedGreetings": "Some people can't just say \"hello\" and leave it at that. These people are the ones who belong to this trope: They cannot give a simple greeting, salutation or announcement. Instead, protocol or cultural mores from their city, state, dimension, planet, or other point of origin, or even a self-imposed code of conduct, require a lengthy greeting far longer than local etiquette requires.\nVariations include:\nThe greeter may fall over exhausted after the greeting; or those they are greeting may do so.\nMay overlap with Try to Fit THAT on a Business Card! or Large Ham Title. See also Long List and Secret Handshake. If one specific person greets people or is greeted in this manner, see catchphrase and Phrase-Catcher respectively.\n"}
{"LampShade": "Lampshade Hanging (or, more informally, \"Lampshading\") is the writers' trick of dealing with any element of the story that threatens the audience's Willing Suspension of Disbelief, whether a very implausible plot development, or a particularly blatant use of a trope, by calling attention to it and simply moving on.\nThe reason for this counter-intuitive strategy is two-fold. First, it assures the audience that the author is aware of the implausible plot development that just happened, and that they aren't trying to slip something past the audience. Second, it assures the audience that the world of the story is like Real Life: what's implausible for you or me is just as implausible for these characters, and just as likely to provoke an incredulous response.\nThe creators are using the tactic of self-deprecatingly pointing out their own flaws themselves, thus depriving critics and opponents of their ammunition. The Turkey City Lexicon refers to this flavor of Lampshade Hanging as a \"Signal from Freud\", and reminds the author that if your characters are complaining about how stupid the latest plot development is, maybe your subconscious is trying to tell you something.\nOn the other hand, Lampshade Hanging done well can make for an entertaining piece of Medium Awareness or momentary lack of Genre Blindness. It can also be used to take care of Fridge Logic, without having to actually do anything. For this reason, it can either be seen as making a bad movie even worse or as adding clever writing and humour.\nThis practice is also known as \"hanging a clock on it\", \"hanging a lantern on it\", or \"spotlighting it\". In the film industry it's sometimes called \"hanging a red flag\" on something, after the screenwriting adage, \"To hang a red flag on something takes the curse off of it,\" meaning that to lampshade something decreases the negative effects it might otherwise have. Teodolinda Barolini referred to this as \"the Geryon Principle\" in reference to how Dante narrates how unbelievable his \"true\" story is the more fantastical it gets. We went with our title because it's the one used in the Mutant Enemy bullpen.\nCan also be combined with a Hand Wave, sometimes invoking an unreveal, to make explaining a plot inconsistency unnecessary. When breaking internal consistency is deliberate this trope can be used to show that, yes, it is deliberate instead of a plot hole. Can also be combined with an active attempt to avoid the trope, in which case the Lampshade Hanging turns into a Defied Trope.\nCommonly seen in the self-aware shows that make up the Deconstructor Fleet; rarely used in the presence of a Drop-In Character. If large numbers of lampshades are hung, then the writers believe lampshades are Better Than a Bare Bulb, this trope's Logical Extreme.\nHypocrisy Nod and Inspiration Nod are specific types of this. Meta Guy is the fellow who does this all the time. Sometimes takes the form of This Is the Part Where.... Compare Discussed Trope, Post-Modernism and Playing with a Trope. No Fourth Wall happens when characters not only discuss tropes, but the writers as well.\nNot to be confused with Lampshade Wearing.\nOnce again, Lampshade Hanging is when attention is drawn to something that is so strange it threatens to break the Willing Suspension of Disbelief. Leaning on the Fourth Wall is for things which make sense in the story but also have a second meaning outside of the story. Try not to get these confused.\n"}
{"TheVillainWins": "We're all used to heroes winning out over the bad guys. The bad guys get theirs, justice is done, and the heroes walk away happy. Sometimes things are a little more bittersweet, but we at least expect the villain to lose in the end. One can even get away with a Downer Ending where it ends badly for the heroes, but many of these kinds of endings are \"nobody wins\" affairs where everybody pays the price (fatally or not). Even if the villain wins in these kinds of endings, it's usually at great enough personal cost to the villain that he or she is utterly ruined as a result.\nNot so with this ultimate of Downer Endings. The Bad Guy Wins is Exactly What It Says on the Tin: complete and ultimate triumph for the villain, and complete and utter devastation (frequently with death or worse) for the hero or heroes who dared to oppose them. A bad guy who wins is a Karma Houdini by definition, and such endings can frequently be depressing as hell itself \u2014 even more so than your regular Downer Ending. When this trope is parodied, it is the happy ending stuck on for the villain instead which is despairingly from the hero's perspective.\nHistory has plenty of examples of this trope, especially in stories of failed rebellions against a powerful empire or recountings of real life tragedies. But in Fictionland, when this kind of ending shows up, it's often used either as a hook for a sequel that will give the hero (or a new hero) the chance to succeed where they failed in the first one, or as a way of showing how much of an utter, hopeless Crapsack World that the characters live in \u2014 particularly in the case of Dystopias, where it serves as a warning to those living in the here and now not to let this kind of thing happen for real. There can be any number of other reasons for the bad guy winning: simply for the sake of a twist ending (especially in horror stories, which are often most effective if they leave the audience with a hugely emotionally negative final shock); out of the writer's desire to be original or to throw in a new twist to keep things fresh or unpredictable; because the writer is really pessimistic and/or believes that True Art Is Angsty; because the villain is a Well-Intentioned Extremist and in this case The Extremist Was Right; or just because the writer couldn't find any other way to end the story which suited them. Sometimes it may all just be part of a Black Comedy anyway.\nDoomed by Canon often requires this trope. If the Big Bad's backstory involves the Big Bad attaining all kinds of success to get him or her into the position that started the story, the Prequel requires them to win \u2014 and kill off any major characters, no matter how sympathetic, who do not make it to the original story. More generally, Villain Protagonists will benefit from this trope, particularly in video games where the player takes on the role of a bad guy.\nSome stories may attempt to use this trope, yet still try to soften the blow. Perhaps the villain's goal is ultimately a good thing. Or the heroes are really Not So Different after all and their loutish behavior keeps us from feeling too sorry for them. Another variant is for the villain to create a Villain World that the heroes must topple in a future story.\nIn cases when the hero was particularly well-liked and/or the villain particularly hated, the audience may call for a sequel in which the villain gets a proper comeuppance. Or lacking that, they may decide to write their own.\nThe sixth form of You Are Too Late is one technique to bring this about. Another technique to invoke this is to form a Xanatos Gambit: the villain wins something regardless of whether the heroes foil their Evil Plan or not. A Last Stand commonly features them.\nDoing this too often or having this happen almost inevitably will result in Invincible Villain.\nSee also: Downer Ending, Karma Houdini, Industrialized Evil, and Shoot the Shaggy Dog. Dystopias often end this way. Compare Team Rocket Wins, when the bad guys in question are usually so ineffectual the audience may actually be happy for them to catch a break. Contrast The Good Guys Always Win. Can overlap with Godwin's Law of Time Travel. May be considered a form of You Can't Thwart Stage One if it happens in a serial work. Also compare Meaningless Villain Victory, in which The Bad Guy Wins, but the victory is rendered hollow or meaningless or actually becomes a defeat due to some technicality or unforeseen chance. Near-Villain Victory is a typical subversion of the trope in which the bad guy does win for a time, only for the good guys to rebound and take that victory away.\nCompare Pyrrhic Villainy when the villain's victory came at a great cost. This is NOT necessarily the same with Karma Houdini and Downer Ending, as there are plenty of happy endings where villains escape unscathed and a plenty of Downer Ending s where the villains suffer as much as everyone.\nIf the story lacks a villain, nature (or the heroes' own flaws) might defeat them instead.\nNote: This is a Spoilered Rotten trope, that means that EVERY SINGLE EXAMPLE on this list is a spoiler by default and most of them will be unmarked. This is your last warning, only proceed if you really believe you can handle this list.\n"}
{"BunnyTropes": "This index is for tropes related to rabbits and hares. While rabbits and hares are different animals in Real Life, in fiction they are often treated similarly, and are sometimes regarded as one and the same.\nSpecific examples from works should be listed on the respective trope page. See The Other Wiki for a list of fictional rabbits and hares and The House Rabbit Society for another list of fictional and real famous rabbits. See also Fearsome Critters of American Folklore for jackalopes.\nNot to be confused with Plot Bunny, Bridge Bunny, Bunny-Ears Lawyer, Down the Rabbit Hole, Gym Bunny, Killer Rabbit, Call a Rabbit a \"Smeerp\" or Call a Smeerp a \"Rabbit\".\n"}
{"ShamefulShrinking": "A character who is often a Large Ham or a Small Name, Big Ego will often brag about how no one or nothing is better than he is. Unfortunately, just as soon as he says this, another character tells him that the boss wants to have a word with him about his lack of progress. As a result, the braggart literally shrinks in shame because of this.\nPut more simply, this is when a character literally shrinks when either embarrassed, ashamed, or humiliated about something. In a fantasy setting, they may truly be becoming smaller, but in other places it's just a visual shorthand. Expect this to show up very often in Comedy or Western Animation.\nNot to be confused with feeling embarrassed about unwanted shriveling of the male genitals.\n"}
{"WeightLossHorror": "Maybe a character doesn't like his current shape and decides he's going to drop those pesky pounds if it kills him. Maybe he meets an unusual stranger on the street with slimming abilities. The point is, he loses weight (or at least takes steps to do so).\nAnd everything goes straight downhill.\nThis trope is for works in which weight loss goes horribly wrong (or, even worse, horribly right). Maybe the characters lose too much weight and are in danger of disappearing altogether. Maybe they unwittingly sign themselves up for a weight-loss service with overly restrictive (read: lethal) penalties. Maybe the diet is magical and requires the sacrificing of children. Really nasty examples may overlap with Body Horror, and self-inflicted magical ones might cross over with Be Careful What You Wish For.\nCompare Fashion Hurts, for other ways in which the effort to maintain appearance can be painful and/or harmful, and Dead Weight and Fattening the Victim for other cases in which weight is associated with horror.\n"}
{"ProphecyPileup": "You are the Chosen One, destined according to prophecy to save the world. But wait. These people are calling you the chosen one as well, and they know nothing of the original prophecy.\nCongratulations! Fate has chosen you not once, but twice. You now have two prophecies to fulfil.\nA prophecy pileup occurs when two or more prophecies overlap. Frequently they will revolve around the same character, but may be linked in some other way. The prophecies may require multiple quests, be able to be solved together, or even turn out to be variations of the same original prophecy.\nA common example is a variation on an Either/Or Prophecy, having one prophecy for the good guys and one for the bad guys, each saying that they will win. Unless this happens, it is unlikely for any prophecies to turn out to be contradictory, despite initial appearances.\nCompare Either/Or Prophecy, Regular Caller, Cursed with Awesome.\nContrast Gambit Pileup where it is the characters running the show rather than fate.\n"}
{"NonhumanHumanoidHybrid": "Since Most Writers Are Human, most humanoid inter-species crossbreeds are Half Human Hybrids. However, sometimes this is averted, and a hybrid has no Homo sapiens in their family tree at all... but will still look human, sometimes even attractively so.\nLike its sibling trope, it may lead to Uneven Hybrids or Heinz Hybrids if the person in question isn't a dead-end of the family tree.\n"}
{"EmoKid": "Teenagers who are whiny, self-important, and generally trying to work their way to self-identification. The character type based off the Emo persona.\nThe things that differentiate and identify Emo Teens are that they dress in black, listen to strange music (specifically, the \"emo\" genre, whence the term comes) and generally think that they are erudite (or, at least, surprisingly coherent). The slightly better-kept ones are usually political. If the character is female, she will tend to be extremely self-conscious about her appearance, but implausibly attractive all the same.\nSince Emo Teens cultivate an out-of-the-mainstream image, sometimes writers get lazy and use them as a stand-in for any variety of geekishness that isn't considered \"too nerdy\".\nMost shows with an Emo Teen do it semi-sympathetically, where the character is at worst whiny and judgmental, but fundamentally good. However, if any character is going to suffer from an overload of Wangst, it's them.\nIn Real Life, most definitions of \"emo\" require that you act like your life sucks when it doesn't to qualify. In fiction, however, There Are No Therapists, and no matter how dark a Back Story a character has, acting even remotely unhappy is sufficient to be labelled \"emo\". Internet fanboards don't care if you spent the first decade of your life in a cupboard under the stairs only to discover your magical new world comes with a mortal enemy, your dad scarred your face with fire and kicked you out for valuing human life above military victory, or you came home from school one day to find that your big brother killed your parents. Suck it up, emo boy.\nIn days past, the Emo Teen would have been a Goth or \u2014 more rarely \u2014 Perky Goth. (Except during The '90s, when they would be wearing grunge flannel.)\n"}
{"PunchPackingPistol": "In Real Life, there are very good reasons why the militaries of the world unanimously arm their soldiers with long guns as primary weapons. These firearms have far better accuracy, effective range, and muzzle energy than any pistol - while various factors make universal rules tricky to apply to terminal ballistics, a standard intermediate-power rifle round (such as the 5.56mm NATO) is generally considered superior to any non-novelty pistol round. A full-power rifle round (such as the 7.62mm NATO) is considered superior to even the gigantic .454 Casull, .50 Action Express, or even .500 Smith and Wesson pistol rounds, novelty ammunition largely disliked by even strong, veteran shooters for their titanic recoil and ludicrous price per bullet. As a rule of thumb, the best soft body armor vests can stop just about any pistol round short of the aforementioned novelty ammunition, even the mighty .44 Magnum, yet will be zipped through like butter by any intermediate-power rifle round; even when multiple vests are stacked on top of each other. To stop these bullets requires hard body armor. Wounding profile is slightly less lopsided in favor of rifle rounds due to some pistol rounds having fairly high momentum and mass, but even then, assault rifle bullets tend to inflict far worse wounds.\nBut in video games? Not so. It's incredibly common for both First- and Third-Person Shooters to offer the player a 'heavy pistol' or revolver which is vastly more powerful per shot than their standard automatic rifle, usually capable of taking out mooks with a single headshot while the rifle might only plink away at them even with those same headshots. Even more standard handguns often have a damage per bullet that's at least comparable to an assault rifle, if not superior.\nWhy does this happen? While having one weapon be overwhelmingly superior might be realistic, it doesn't make for particularly fun gameplay. If video game pistols reflected the same role they do in Real Life, players would come to the same conclusion real militaries do: that there's little reason to ever use them when an automatic rifle is available. Developers want to give players a variety of more-or-less balanced weapons and tactics to choose from, and dramatically boosting the power of pistols allows them to stay fun and useful weapons, despite their lower capacity and (in games where you can aim weapons) harder-to-use ironsights, without making any glaring inaccuracies to the average player.\nContrast Ranged Emergency Weapon, when the pistol is the weakest gun in the game instead, as well as Sorting Algorithm of Weapon Effectiveness where the starting weapons gets outclassed quickly. See Shotguns Are Just Better for a similarly \"basic\" weapon being among the most effective of a game. Not to be confused with a punch-triggered pistol.\n"}
{"PentUpPowerPeril": "It's awesome to have superpowers or natural magical abilities, because you can do all sorts of cool things no Muggle can do. You've got the power inside you. The trouble is that it's always trying to get out. If you don't use your magic, it builds up inside you, until it has no place to go but out. Being too full of magic may cause it to slip out. Or, the usual power outlet is blocked and the powers cause internal pressure and back up creating all sorts of problems such as Superpower Meltdown, Explosive Overclocking, or just plain old Wacky Antics.\nIf the character uses Emotional Powers they might \"vent\" their bottled up powers with an Angst Nuke.\nCompare Phlebotinum Overdose, when the magic is forced in from the outside instead of self-generating from the inside. If you're thinking of non-magical digestive-related buildup, see Gasshole, Balloon Belly, Potty Emergency and Potty Failure.\nCompare and contrast:\nSubtrope of Phlebotinum Overload.\n"}
{"ADarkerShadeOfGrey": "In conflicts that feature Grey and Gray Morality, neither side in the struggle is more \"right\" than the other due to both having well-justified goals that they accomplish by perpetrating acts of heroism and villainy.\nAt least, that's the way in works in theory.\nIn practice, either one side has more heroes than the other, or the writing portrays one side as, if not more \"right,\" then at least more sympathetic.\nThe usual result is the story and struggle shifting tone, sometimes slightly, sometimes dramatically, making one side the heroes and the other the villains. Sometimes, to balance out this shift, authors will give the \"good guys\" opportunities to show their pragmatism, or they'll give the \"bad guys\" a chance to show off that they're not really that bad. How effective this is depends on a number of things, but suffice to say that it doesn't always work, in which case the tale continues to favor one group as \"the heroes\" over the other.\nA Lighter Shade of Black is this trope's Evil Counterpart. Of course, this is not one of the 50 Shades of Grey.\n"}
{"LadyKiller": "The (legal, and less repulsive than the better-known types) sexual predator \u2014 a man who relentlessly pursues, lands, loves, and then abandons members of the opposite sex, a skill bestowed upon him to demonstrate what a badass he is. Sometimes comic, sometimes a monster, always successful, this character leaves behind a string of broken hearts, and occasional vows of revenge that are rarely fulfilled. Casanova's only motivation is indulging his lust and desire, sating them with the bodies of his conquests.\nThis trope tends to suffer from three double standards when portrayed in media;\nContrast with the unsuccessful Casanova Wannabe. Compare with the inexplicable Kavorka Man. A guy who gets the girls like a Casanova, but unintentionally, is a Chick Magnet. If kind-hearted, may overlap with Chivalrous Pervert. The Charmer is equally charming but less sex-obsessed. If they really get around but want to settle down, it's Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places. A Handsome Lech has more negative connotations and a sparser scorecard than the Casanova.\nThe trope is named for Giacomo Casanova (1725-1798), a soldier, spy, diplomat, adventurer, and librarian whose extensive but unreliable autobiography (in which he almost literally described himself as God's Gift to Womennote\u00a0\"Feeling that I was born for the sex opposite of mine, I have always loved it and done all that I could to make myself loved by it.\") established his eternal fame as a lover. It should be noted that the historical Casanova was closer to a Chivalrous Pervert who really was looking for love... just with women who were locked in loveless political marriages \u2014 and also gained his successes famously ugly. (Definitely\u25ca he was no Heath Ledger\u25ca.) Interesting and prone to be noted for his modern wannabes, he was one of the few 18th century men who bathed almost daily and asked the same thing from his partners.\nMany films, TV movies and TV mini-series are named for and based on that person. The best known are Fellini's 1976 film, the 2005 film starring Heath Ledger, and the 2005 BBC drama mini-series starring David Tennant. The latter is considered one of the more faithful adaptations of Casanova's memoirs, while Fellini's... wasn't.\nFor the juvenile version \u2014 all of the above without the sex \u2014 see Kid-anova. Contrast the Serial Romeo (who falls in love with a long succession of women, one at a time and for reasonable periods). If the guy is actually only rumored to be a Casanova and has no evidence onscreen, it's the Urban Legend Love Life. If he develops feelings for one of his conquests (or someone who refuses him), he's a Ladykiller in Love. See More Friends, More Benefits for when the mechanics of a game encourage the player character to act this way.\nNote: It should be mentioned that even after the affairs were over, most of Casanova's ex-lovers still liked him, and he was reputedly quite the gentleman. This trope would probably fit (the fictional) Don Juan better.\n"}
{"HollywoodPsychology": "Research is hard. While this is generally true of all science, psychology in particular is vulnerable, as it's a very, very new field still under heavy development. Only recently has psychology emerged as a mature science with robust theories, and supposed \"facts\" of the past are still in popular culture despite being debunked. Writers fail to recognize this, and the supposed professionals in their stories will quote woefully out-of-date representations of Sigmund Freud's theory of the unconscious, Carl Jung's collective unconscious archetypes, or Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This is the equivalent of a modern physicist discussing luminiferous aether, a chemist trying to create a Philosopher's Stone, or a biologist believing Lamarck Was Right.\nFurther complicating things is the Rule of Cool: if there are multiple versions of a disorder, a writer will tend toward the most interesting, dramatic, or visible of them. Thus, in fiction, all dyslexics can't read anything past a fourth grade level, all people with Tourette's compulsively swear, and all people with schizophrenia think demons are out to cover up the truth of global warming. Many people, overexposed to the fictional versions, are surprised to discover that not only are there milder versions of all these disorders, but the milder versions account for anywhere from 90% to 99% of the people diagnosed with them.\nNaturally, there is some Truth in Television. Freud is still relevant, he is simply not the state of the art, but rather, one of the beginnings (similar to the way Newton's Laws are still used alongside Einstein's). While many or even most of the theories of Freud, Jung, and other early psychoanalysts have been refuted scientifically, their work shaped and continues to shape psychology and the popular mind. Concepts like projection, defense mechanisms, and the like are still used in therapy... simply not in their antique form. For instance, Hollywood is woefully unaware of the refinements suggested by Anna Freud (Sigmund's daughter) and his other students.\nOne big area where Hollywood really missed the boat is that from the 30s well into the 60s, radical behaviorism dominated psychological research. Researchers attempted to stamp out \"mentalism\" (that is, the study of consciousness itself) in favor of quantifying behavior. Psychology was ghetto-ized, and in the US, survived in the shadow of psychiatry (a medical field, ironically enough). This may partially explain the powerful, anachronistic hold Freud has over Hollywood. The Freud of Hollywood is psychoanalysis of the 60s, flanderized and spun for drama.\nAnother thing Hollywood tends to skip in psychology is the idea that most events of the average plot would leave The Everyman severely traumatised by the end of it, not just shrugging it off with a smile and one-liner. Because really, which of those sounds more fun?\nFor a reality check on a number of these subjects, see the Psychology entries of our own Useful Notes.\nHollywood Mental Conditions\nHollywood Therapy\nSee also Emotion Tropes, Intelligence Tropes, Madness Tropes, and Parental Issues.\n"}
{"RealTimeStrategy": "A Strategy Game subgenre which focuses on construction and control of a fighting force in battle that takes place in real-time. It has an army of tropes all its own.\nDebate rages as to what the first originating RTS actually was, the results largely dependent on the age and nationality of the participants. The ZX Spectrum had some early entrants many many moons ago (1984 saw Stonkers and 1987 \u2014 Nether Earth); the MSX saw Herzog in the late 80s \u2014 but only in Japan; and 1989 saw its sequel Herzog Zwei on the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) which introduced many of the genre conventions. But it was 1992's Dune II by Westwood Studios (later of Command & Conquer fame) that established the form and the tropes of the RTS which are known to the masses today.\nIn comparison to Turn-Based Strategy, Real Time Strategy has players take action whenever they wish (within the constraints of how often any particular action can be taken). Play will continue for other players and entities in the game even if one player sits back and does nothing, rather than breaking up the sequence of play into discrete turns for each player, which brings multiplayer matches down from hours or days to minutes. While this leaves less time for strategizing and encourages \"twitchy\" play-styles, it makes commanders less omniscient, allowing for ambushes and distractions to work better.\nAlmost all games of this type are based on ground combat on a 2D map, with various terrain and obstacles adding interest to the battlefield. Airborne and seaborne units are sometimes incorporated, but they are seldom realistic in terms of speed and performance (almost all aircraft in RTS games can hover, cannot change altitude, and have unlimited fuel and ammo).\nThe basic archetypes of units in a typical RTS:\nA critical part of all RTS games is the base-building and Resource-Gathering element, which is also conducted very rapidly. The basic archetypes of an RTS base are:\nWhat order you construct buildings in, and how quickly you do so, is often the most important factor in deciding the outcome, to the chagrin of some players.\nThe genre also possesses a number of aesthetic conceits, so typical to its presentation that they often confuse even the games' creators (Note: the first three are probably inherited from tabletop wargames):\nEnhancing one's forces with better equipment and training makes perfect sense, but while a few titles do use plausible terminology for requisitioning new gear, training specialists, retooling factories and deploying the finished products to active forces, most use the peculiar choice of \"research\" for the process. This gives players the surreal image of scientists doing research on the front lines, making miraculous breakthroughs almost immediately, and then promptly forgetting whatever it was, every single level.\nPathfinding isn't necessarily especially weak in RTSs, but in other genres the player is usually too busy running along a linear path thwarting pre-scripted ambushes to notice. Not so in an RTS. Since RTSs take place in enormous, twisty campaigns and the player is constantly shepherding large numbers of units with a perfect view of their incompetence, the tendency of unit AI to unnecessarily bumble around the map in response to choke points, and clump together when attacking, becomes all too glaringly obvious.\nRefinements of the genre formula have appeared over the years:\nFor common tropes, see Strategy Game Tropes.\nCompare Strategy RPG. See also Real-Time with Pause for a slightly different approach (may also have variable time scale).\nThe Multiplayer Online Battle Arena genre came out of Real-Time Strategy genre and utilizes a similar camera but with much smaller scope that limits you to one character (and occasionally other units depending on the game's option for it but largely most players will be using one unit) supporting waves of weaker units trying to bring down the enemy's base. See its own page for more information.\n"}
{"StudioChatter": "A Music Trope. When a band records part of a song, they may sometimes leave in some of the talking that occurred during the recording session. It generally appears at the beginning or end of a song.\nA subtrope of Throw It In!, related to Leave the Camera Running. If you were looking for unintelligible chatter from background characters in other media, see Audience Murmurs.\n"}
{"GreenRooming": "Introducing a new character who is then inexplicably ignored for a few episodes. Often the result of a clumsy Debut Queue setup.\nAlternatively, a common use of Lampshade Hanging to explain why a cast member useful to the plot isn't around. This can be to exclude a character who would make a plot end too early or because the writers want to focus on specific characters.\nPoorly used, this will introduce a character who is used for a single arc and then forgotten for long periods of time. The kind of writer prone to this is also liable to keep doing it.\nThe trope is named after the \"Green Room,\" a backstage area in a theatre where actors who are not required on stage can wait and preparenote\u00a0Although there are older green rooms which are actually green in colour, this is not a requisite. The etimology is not certain, and may have nothing to do with the colour, the idea being that the ignored characters are just hanging out there. Not to be confused with shows shot in a green room, and absolutely not to be confused with the film Green Room.\nSee also Offstage Waiting Room.\n"}
{"WeUsedtoBeFriends": "Our True Companions, Badass Crew, Five-Man Band - whatever - are pretty close. They share a tight relationship, trust and protect each other, would die for each other, if it might be necessary.\nOnly, what's this? One or several members of The Team make(s) a mistake or the wrong call.\nOr they just become evil for some reason.\nThe reasons might vary, but bottom line is, the once tight bond between the character(s) in question and their former friend(s) is severely damaged, if not completely broken. Instead of love and sympathy, at least one of them feels aversion, distrust, and/or disdain for the other(s), if not outright hatred depending on the severity of what the character has done. Whether they start actively fighting each other or simply share a broken bond and avoid each other will vary, but since things sometimes don't work out the way they are supposed to, they can't reconcile by the end of the episode.\nIn contrast to a member being Put on a Bus (which doesn't necessarily mean these two tropes can't coincide), this trope focuses on the extraction of a character from their usual environment, due to aversion, distrust or a misunderstanding. However, the character is being kept as a part of the story, which is what differs this from simply being Put on a Bus - the extracted character is not being dropped by the writers.\nThis situation might eventually be resolved by things slowly getting back to normal or it doesn't.\nMight trigger a Beard of Sorrow, 10-Minute Retirement, Face\u2013Heel Turn, Heel\u2013Face Turn, a degree in badassery or a Despair Event Horizon. The list goes on and on. Can be revealed via Former Friends Photo.\nContrast with Heel\u2013Face Turn. Compare with Achilles in His Tent, Deus Exit Machina, My Greatest Failure, Grey and Gray Morality and Jumping Off the Slippery Slope, Evil Former Friend. See also Cain and Abel, when the former friends in question were either siblings, or were childhood friends who grew up with each other prior to their falling out. For the inversion, see also Fire-Forged Friends: enemies-turned-allies.\nThe song by the Dandy Warhols is the Trope Namer, it being the theme from Veronica Mars kinda figures.\n"}
{"ExternallyValidatedProphecy": "When a character makes a prediction about the future which is not fulfilled in the work, yet an audience aware of history knows will be fulfilled. A Call-Forward, but in real life.\nContrast It Will Never Catch On and This Is Going to Be Huge, where the character makes predictions that the audience knows will be invalidated.\n"}
{"DePowered": "A superpowered character (generally a very powerful one) loses their powers for a permanent or extended period of time.\nThis isn't just a case of Brought Down to Normal which inevitably ends, but a much longer lasting if not permanent reduction in strength. This is often done as a long term Drama-Preserving Handicap on the character in order to keep them in the cast without having to write them off or use really convoluted Green Rocks and Kryptonite Factor plots. (This may be accomplished by a Power Nullifier.)\nIt's unlikely the character will be pleased by this turn of events, and if they're power hungry or evil they'll fight tooth and nail to find a way to get it back. Heroes who just want to be normal will be happy, even if it means they can no longer use their finger-snapping problem solving powers.\nThis trope mostly applies to characters who are already gods, godlike, or mortals who through the story gain powers to rival the gods. The result is usually a God in Human Form. Expect them to learn that Power Loss Makes You Strong.\nThis isn't just a simple Failure Is the Only Option or Status Quo Is God, where a character who gains godlike powers has them gone in the same episode, but the writers trying jump out of the corner they've painted themselves into by depowering the character who by all indications should/could have kept all their powers throughout the show.\nIf this happened because the character was transported to another dimension, it's because Your Magic's No Good Here. Subtrope of Brought Down to Normal. See also How to Stop the Deus ex Machina and Field Power Effect.\n"}
{"Radio": "The Ur-Example of broadcast media; like Television but without the pictures. You youngin's might think of it as like a podcast, but sent over the open airwaves. As a serial broadcast medium, radio shares many tropes with television. Indeed, early radio originated many of these tropes. Several television series originated on the wireless. These days, of course, television has eclipsed radio to the extent the latter is seen as mostly a format for music and live talk shows, though some stations in some countries (like BBC Radio 4 in the UK) offer drama, comedy, documentaries and more.\nThe name \"radio\" comes from the low-energy electromagnetic waves first detected by Heinrich Hertz in 1887. These waves \"radiated\" out from the spark-gap generator that produced them. The first radio transmitters could only broadcast Morse code, but soon the technology was developed to piggyback audio signals onto a radio-frequency carrier wave. Soon afterward, rules were established to allow for specific radio frequency bands to be allocated to different licensed broadcasters within an area. Eventually, the technology to encode video signals onto radio carrier waves was developed, but by that time radio waves had been used for audio-only broadcasts for so long that the word \"radio\" had become synonymous with them. (The broadcasters who used radio waves for video signals had to invent a new word for it.) Today, some things called radio, such as cable radio and internet radio stations, don't even use radio waves at all.\nSee also: Audio Play, Podcast, and Web Original.\n"}
{"Unfavorite": "The nasty end of Parental Favoritism. Where there's an Alpha wolf, there's got to be a Beta. When there is a first banana, there is a second banana. This is the person in the family who can't get a break. For example, this is the child who's the big let-down to their parents, the daughter that was supposed to be a son (or vice-versa), the child the parents had by accident when they'd already decided they didn't need another mouth to feed, the adoptive, foster, or stepchild that came before the parents had a biological child, the illegitimate child conceived by infidelity on the part of one of the parents. But all in all, this is basically the kid who is always getting the short-end of the stick.\nA regular line that may be entailed with this is a variant of, \"Honestly, (insert name), why can't ya be more like (insert favorite's name)?\"\nFrequently, being The Unfavorite is a Freudian Excuse for a character who's a particularly pathetic loser. If the Parental Favoritism was garden variety (or even a product of his/her imagination), PG-rated Wangst, this is probably being played for comedy, a weak excuse for being a failure. If the favoritism was particularly vicious, however, up to and including abuse, The Unfavorite becomes a more tragic character \u2014 most probably The Woobie. Sometimes, however, the Unfavorite is almost suspiciously well-adjusted.\nA variant is where The Unfavorite is actually highly successful and dutiful, but can never get the approval of his parents, simply because their sibling will always do \"better\" in their parents' eyes. (\"Hey look, Dad, I won the Nobel Prize for Physics!\" \"Only one? That's nothin' \u2014 your brother won Employee of the Month at Shop 'n Go 3 times!\"). The Unfavorite doesn't need to play second fiddle to an actual sibling, and can even be an only child. Unfavorites without a sibling are often unwanted or unexpected children and can even, in perhaps an extreme case, be passed over for the family pet.\nThe audience's attitude towards the unfavorite is often based on what age the character is. There's a common perception that an adult character should really have gotten over this by now and moved on, even if the viewers/readers empathize with them. A child character, on the other hand, is likely to get the audience's unreserved support.\nAge notwithstanding, this is usually a character you sympathize with, because we're supposed to root for the disadvantaged; expect the favorite either to be rubbing their status in their sibling's face, be an Aloof Big Brother, or completely unaware of the situation. It is, however, completely possible that the character is interpreting some behavior as favoritism \u2014 and the other character also regards himself as the Unfavorite. (Cue Sibling Rivalry.) Also, another possible situation is that the favorite is indeed aware of the situation, sympathize with the unfavorite, and may even start the \"talk with the parents\" scene.\nAnd Heaven help the poor kid if the favorite child is dead. (Possibly having received the status of \"favorite\" by dying.) See also You Should Have Died Instead. The same thing goes if The Unfavorite was a result of Death by Childbirth, where the family hates the kid for \"murdering\" their mother.\nCan easily escalate into Black Sheep or Cain and Abel, or in particularly nasty cases, one or both of the parents having a go at offing the unfavorite offspring. May be rooted in a Death by Childbirth. May cross over with \"Well Done, Son!\" Guy if the Unfavorite wants some recognition. If the favorite of the parents isn't even a member of their family, it's a case of Why Are You Not My Son?. When each parent has one favorite and one Unfavorite, it's Jacob and Esau. In a workplace situation, see Boss's Unfavorite Employee.\n"}
{"LimeyGoesToHollywood": "A rather common thing for British actors and those of other nationalities to do: decide that they could be better served in their career by going to Los Angeles.\nIt's the most influential and pervasive film industry in the world. If you want to be not just a national but an international star you pretty much have to spend at least some time there. In addition, you can always come back to the U.K. and use the money from the States for British TV, indies, and theater.\nThe popularity of British actors is also due to the fact that they are a) cheaper, b) less likely to be doing films and c) less likely to be barred from gay roles by their agents. And then there's this final selling point for the Hollywood studios, probably the most important: They speak English!\nOddly, Brits and Europeans seem to have an above average chance of playing villains or jerks... See Fake American for when they put on the accent as well.\nFictional\nReal Life\nSuccessful ones are listed below; in fact, thousands of non-American actors go over each pilot season hoping to make it big, to the point documentaries get made about it.\n"}
{"CapturedSuperentity": "This trope covers the idea of (usually) \"lesser\" beings capturing an alien, a god, an angel, etc. for some typically nefarious purpose. Obviously, some form of powerful magic or advanced technology will be needed to pull this off, making it a more common plot in Fantasy or Speculative Fiction.\nIt's also a standard \"The Men in Black\" plot, in which the government or other secret organization has miraculously captured a powerful entity and are extracting its knowledge and power usually through various unpleasant means. Extra MIB points if this is occurring at Area 51.\nIf the being came with advanced technology, they've likely been reverse-engineering it for themselves. Or maybe they've secretly put said technology on the open market, claiming that they invented it. If a common modern day technology is revealed to have actually been a direct result of all this, then E.T. Gave Us Wi-Fi.\nMagical entities (more often than alien ones) have a habit of breaking out and slaughtering their captors.\nNaturally, should the entity's species find out about this, they're gonna be pissed, leading to the threat of The End of the World as We Know It. This may be justified, if said race was going to destroy us anyway. Oh, and Heaven help you if the captured entity is just a baby, and Mom comes calling. But even without outside help, in most cases the captured being probably won't be a prisoner for very long. So you are well advised to stand clear.\nIf the entity is forced to obey commands, this becomes Olympus Mons. If the entity is a Power Source, it may be Powered by a Forsaken Child. If the focus is obtaining profit from a substance generated by the entity, it's Mainlining the Monster. If the focus is on simple containment of the entity or its power, you wind up with Sealed Evil in a Can or Sealed Good in a Can.\n"}
{"CoverAlbum": "In Music, artists and groups are influenced by earlier ones. As a result, most artists and groups perform and play several covers of their favourite songs. In many cases, said artists and groups record them. Said versions can be more famous then the original recording or even surpass it, in quality. These covers can also be entirely different to the original, whether it be in style, gender or meaning.\nA Cover Album is what happens when you compile several of these Cover Versions together and exclusively in one album.\nThere are basically two kinds of this:\nSee also Cover Version, Covered Up, The Cover Changes the Gender, The Cover Changes the Meaning and Suspiciously Similar Song. Compare and contrast with Remix Album.\nAs a note for the tropers: We're talking about recordings, whether these are live recordings or studio ones, and said recordings should consist only of covers. There may be exceptions with one or two (no more) original songs.\n"}
{"PacingATrench": "When a character waits for someone or thinks about something really important to them, they will normally pace around the room while doing so. Maybe they will walk back and forth in a straight line, or maybe they will walk in a circle. That's normal.\nBut some characters tend to really like doing it. They walk along the same path so much that they actually wear down the floor, and if left to pace long enough, you might find them in a literal trench made by their own feet. Hopefully the plot might call them before they end up in China.\nThis is normally a comedy trope to show that the character has been thinking about their problem so much and concentrating so hard that they haven't noticed they have dug themselves into a hole.\n"}
{"HypocriteHasAPoint": "If there's anything people agree on, it's that being a Hypocrite is bad. The most negative of spotlights are trained on those who do not practice what they preach. A Straw Hypocrite is very easy to create and remains a common choice of antagonist, particularly in an Author Tract. If someone is a hypocrite, they are assumed to be rightly contemptible and completely wrong.\nIf only things were that simple.\nEven if a person is a hypocrite, they can still be right about something. If Bob The Alcoholic criticizes Tom for drinking away his pain, he still raises the point that Tom could find a better way of solving his issues. If high school dropout Alice chastises Sammy for failing college, she could then say that Sammy shouldn't lose sight of her future. This goes double if Alice is Sammy\u2019s mother.\nSee also Hypocrisy Nod, Ad Hominem, and At Least I Admit It. This trope may also be related to Not So Different and Brutal Honesty.\nFull-Sibling trope to:\nHalf-sib to Strawman Has a Point, where it's the audience, rather than another character who says \"Wait, that character is being presented as though he's wrong, but he's not, entirely.\"\nCompare Jacob Marley Warning, when someone warns another person against making the same life choices they did, justified because they can offer the perspective of having experienced how it will turn out badly.\nContrast Psychological Projection where the character accusations are based entirely on their own faults.\n"}
{"ExpressLaneLimit": "In a large supermarket, there will be more than one checkout lane clearly designated \"N Items or Fewer\" (or \"N Items or Less,\" which makes Grammar Nazis complain). This allows customers who don't have a lot to buy not to have to wait in line behind those who do.\nIn fiction, mounting violence ensues when someone blatantly exceeds the limit, or tries to stay under by making up rules about what can be considered as a single item.\nThere's a variant where someone is only a little over the limit in a way that everyone finds acceptable, but wastes a lot of time fretting over the limit out of principle, trying to decide what they don't need and what should or shouldn't count as one item.\nThese days, the advent of self-checkout lanes in supermarkets has made this less common than it used to be. Customers can now judge, based on how many items they are purchasing, whether it's less effort to wait in line for an employee to ring them up, or to simply do it themselves. Alternatively, the lanes are designated as \"basket only\", placing a limit on volume of purchases rather than quantity.\nGoing one item over the limit is common fodder for a Felony Misdemeanor. Compare Mattress Tag Gag.\n"}
{"ShatterpointTap": "This is where a character can destroy solid objects by detecting or otherwise targeting their \"weak point\" or \"breaking point\" or \"flaw point\" and striking the object with a comparatively light blow.\nNot to be confused with Pressure Point, which is essentially this for human bodies, or with The Last Straw, which is the proverbial straw-and-the-camel's-back rendered literal. Compare with Glass-Shattering Sound.\n"}
{"ProHumanTransHuman": "This character has been hit with a Viral Transformation, Emergency Transformation, become a cyborg, demon, magical creature, alien or discovers they were never human at all. Despite this, and regardless of any angst over What Have I Become?, they decide that rather than go down the path of Transhuman Treachery and be a Smug Super, Black Shirt, or The Quisling, they will do everything in their power to stay a part of humanity. And if their new species/transhuman fellows are anti-human, they will vow to protect humanity in a pseudo Faustian Rebellion.\nThis can also include transhumans who cast themselves in a shepherd-like role for mankind. This doesn't include forcibly applying What Measure Is a Non-Super? to bootstrap humanity up, though. That's more of a Visionary Villain who believes Utopia Justifies the Means. Many Friendly Neighborhood Vampires fall in this category.\nIf the transformation is due to The Virus, this requires copious Heroic Willpower. These characters can usually pull off a Sheep in Wolf's Clothing gambit. See also Monster Adventurers. Related to My Species Doth Protest Too Much, which refers to creatures that aren't former humans.\nOpposite Trope to Super Supremacist, a superpowered individual who regards the non-superpowered as beneath them. Super Trope to Vampire Refugee and Phlebotinum Rebel. Contrast Transhuman Treachery. See also/compare A God I Am Not.\n"}
{"TagalongChronicler": "A character who accompanies the other characters with the stated purpose to document, chronicle, compose songs about, or otherwise immortalize the adventures that they have.\nTheir motivation for this may vary from trying to make a name as a famous storyteller, through insatiable curiosity, to coercion by other characters. It may also simply be their job. In Heroic Fantasy, the chronicler is often a Bard, a Wandering Minstrel, a scholar, etc. Professional journalists fall under the Tagalong Reporter subtrope.\nThe chronicler's relationship with other characters can also vary: they might be The Load, a Non-Action Guy, or of limited use as The Social Expert. But they can also be or develop into a full-fledged adventurer and peer to the other characters. The key part is what motivates them to go on the adventure in the first place\u2014namely, the desire to tell others about it later on.\nSometimes overlaps with Narrator All Along and In Defence Of Story Telling. Out of universe, it can be a manifestation of Most Writers Are Writers and Write What You Know.\nSupertrope to Tagalong Reporter. Compare I Should Write a Book About This, The Storyteller, and First-Person Peripheral Narrator. If this character is a Fourth-Wall Observer, then he's an All-Knowing Singing Narrator.\nVery much Truth in Television. Virtually every major expedition since the invention of writing had to have someone keeping track of events, so it was this whenever the leader himself wasn't the one taking notes. Very often, a priest/missionary took the role thanks to being the only literate fellow around \u2014 which cemented the image of a chronicler as a non-combat type.\n"}
{"MagicalFlautist": "A character that is notable for having a flute or some other kind of wind instrument, playing tunes with it that give a feeling of mystery or magic, and for being quite mysterious themselves. Bonus points if this character is a representation of nature or has the power of mind control, summoning, or teleportation. The flute itself might be an Instrument of Murder, and the flutist might be a Musical Assassin, but not always.\nA Snake Charmer is a subtrope. See also: Elemental Powers, Friend to All Living Things, Magic Music, Wandering Minstrel.\n"}
{"SuperDeformed": "An artistic style in anime in which a normally realistically proportioned character is rendered in a shorter, rounder form, often with a big head and short limbs, somewhat resembling a caricature of themselves as a tiny yet plump toddler.\nGenerally considered cute as well as humorous, it's most commonly used in parody or as part of promotional material, although it can be found in some shows at points of extreme comedy/slapstick, or when characters are seen to be acting extremely \"cute\" or immature.\nAlso known as \"chibi\" (Japanese for \"small\") in some circles, although it's not just confined to anime \u2014 it's a very common form of Fan-Art. Name any popular character, chibi art exists of them. In fact, it's almost as common as Rule 34.\nThis also appears in video games, especially older video games with small characters compared to the screen, the Super-Deformed style was used mainly to get around graphical limitations so a character was recognizable and their face wouldn't be just a single pixel. Some newer games, use a version of this where characters appear super deformed on the The Overworld or when the camera is far away but in cutscenes, character portraits, and battles they will be depicted with more realistic proportions (for an example, in Disgaea and Cave Story). See Graphics-Induced Super-Deformed for that.\nCompare Top-Heavy Guy, Puni Plush and Wild Take. Contrast to Noodle People. See also Big Head Mode.\nA Sub-Trope of Fun Size.\nNot to be confused with an extremely deformed character.\n"}
{"PrinceOfPranksters": "Plenty of sitcoms and comedy films love to have this character. A character who revels in pulling the most elaborate of pranks on a regular basis. Whenever this character is around, everyone else runs the risk of sitting on whoopee cushions, putting salt in their tea instead of sugar, waking up to find their eyebrows gone...you get the picture. We're talking about The Prankster, only cranked Up to Eleven.\nThis character is typically male but female examples have become more prominent. Note that the POP differs from the Class Clown as a Class Clown will normally be loved for his/her comedy antics while the POP will typically be feared and sometimes despised for their pranks outside of their normal circle of friends. Having this character around will generally lead to an Escalating War if someone wishes to challenge them. They are, however, liable to Menace Decay.\n Folklore & Mythology\n Literature\n Live Action TV\n Tabletop Games\n Webcomics\n Western Animation\n"}
{"AntiHeroTeam": "An Anti Hero Team is Exactly What It Says on the Tin, a group of people consisting of Anti Heroes. Sometimes, there will be an Anti-Villain on the team or even The Hero. In that case, it will be a mixed team. Both Token Good Teammates and Token Evil Teammates can show up on these teams. The mix of exact moral alignments makes these types ripe for internal conflict, but when push comes to shove, they stick by each other more often than not.\nOften leads to Black and Gray Morality or Grey and Gray Morality. Overlaps often with Rag Tag Bunch Of Misfits.\n"}
{"Combos": "In video games, combos are a sequence of hits where, if the first hit connects, the target cannot act in any capacity until it is over (compare to Mercy Invincibility). A Combo Breaker is the sole exception to this rule. If your target could have escaped your attack sequence by any other means, such as blocking or performing an invincible move, then it isn't a combo.\nGenerally these show up in fighting games, but they can also be seen in other genres. For combos to be possible, attacks in a given game must put the enemy in a state where they cannot act (fighting games refer to this as \"hitstun\"). The state must also be vulnerable, and the attacker must recover from their attack fast enough to deliver another before the state ends.\nKnocking an opponent down can end a combo due to the potentially gained invincibility, but not always. Some games have moves that can be used on downed opponents, and knock-downs due to effects of being dizzy actually set the opponent up for further punishment.\nA gauge will often be present, especially in fighting games, that will keep track of successfully combo'd hits. When the combo meter reaches a high number, you have Idiosyncratic Combo Levels, and may receive some entertaining messages underneath.\nVery much Truth in Television for martial arts, as fighters will train to deliver a series of moves which are easy to do in succession, maintaining momentum while preventing the opponent from recovering.\nIf two or more attacks are done in concert or simultaneously, but do not fulfill the above criteria, it isn't a combo, but may be considered a Combination Attack.\nCommands for special moves are not combos (e.g. down, diagonal, toward + punch).\nCombo is a term that can be used loosely out in the wild; many uses of the word likely do not fit on this article (but perhaps on the Combination Attack article). However, feel free to add parodies or other examples that contain some aspects of combos (just be sure to label them as such). Rhythm game chains and puzzle game chains are not combos, nor are the combination attacks found in Chrono Trigger. Not to be confused with delicious cylindrical snack crackers with cheezy filling. Nor is it about getting fries and a drink with your burger.\n"}
{"GetUpGoToSchoolSaveTheWorld": "When a show has a preteen or teen hero, the message is usually as follows...\nBeating up the Big Bad, stopping some giant monster from squishing the hometown, protecting fellow classmates from the creatures of darkness, and saving the universe from certain doom time and time again? Easy.\nDealing with social pressures and crushes? Hard!\nIt's basically one giant Aesop, and can succumb to all the pratfalls and drawbacks that those things entail. Played right, it can be an effective way to communicate to the audience. Played wrong, and it can be disastrous.\nIf the work becomes a Long Runner, this could become \"Wake Up, Go To Work, Save The World\" as the protagonist grows up. Such shows will often result in a One-Hour Work Week. Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Smallville are good examples.\nJuvenile version of the Part-Time Hero. Usually a Triple Shifter. The mental and social counterpart to Mundangerous. Often overlaps with Socially Awkward Hero. Can result in Shouldn't We Be in School Right Now?. Compare Slept Through the Apocalypse.\n"}
{"GrayAndWhiteMorality": "Near the very idealistic end of the many Shades of Conflict (only Good vs. Good is more), a setting with White and Grey Morality features no truly evil characters, but ranges through a spectrum of squeaky-clean heroes, slightly more sarcastic heroes, borderline heroes, Well Intentioned Extremists, and the occasional Anti-Villain at worst. Conflict is generated either through misguided ideals or simple misunderstandings, so there is often an undercurrent of \"if only people would sit down and talk to one another, they'd find they're Not So Different after all\".\nExpect a great deal of dog-petting and Heel Face Turning, from characters only nominally \"heels\" to begin with. Someone will likely say Silly Rabbit, Cynicism Is for Losers! at some point.\nThis does not necessarily imply that there is little conflict or that the conflict is lightweight. Two powerful forces working at cross-purposes can cause an amazing amount of destruction and mayhem even though both of them have good reasons for what they're trying to do.\nContrast Black and Gray Morality, where an Anti-Hero is the best you can expect from the good guys; because True Art Is Angsty, though, this trope is a lot less common than that one, at least among works intended for older audiences. If the antagonists only became so due to a negative influence from outside, this may overlap with Rousseau Was Right. In that case, the occasional villain may pop up, but they will inevitably be shown to be a victim of horrible circumstances that shaped them into what they became (rather than simply expressing a monstrous nature they always possessed). See also Morality Kitchen Sink.\n"}
{"Sockpuppet": "A secondary, pseudonymous Net identity created by an individual in order to give the impression that there are multiple people who agree with a given point, idea, or action, when in reality there's only one. Sock puppets are usually used to post follow-ups that praise their owner or echo their convictions, in the hopes that they will convince real people to pay attention to them and/or their agenda. Alternatively, they can be used to argue against the poster's real agenda, but in such a stupid or offensive manner as to discredit the opposition. Sometimes, they are used to evade bans. While the first Sock Puppets appeared on Usenet (i.e. they are pretty much as old as discussion on the Internet itself), they have long since spread to other electronic venues, most notably blogs.\nSock puppeteers are not limited to individuals, though. Numerous groups \u2014 political, commercial, religious, and atheistic \u2014 have attempted to manipulate public opinion on the Net using false identities that purported to be \"real\" people. And multiple Sock Puppets are a necessary part of any AstroTurf campaign. Fortunately, they tend to be fairly heavy-handed and reasonably obvious to most people.\nThe term is a long-standing one in electronic media, dating back to the early days of the Net in the 1980s. It originated on Usenet and is still seen there, especially in the anti-spam groups. The term itself comes from the practice of creating a cheap puppet by pulling a sock over your hand, and then pretending to talk to it. One sub-category of the sock puppet is the \"concern troll,\" in which a sock puppet pretends to be part of a faction but makes \"concerned\" derogatory comparisons to another faction for whom the troll is a sock puppet. Another is The Shill.\nThis is one of the more popular \"Internet Argument Techniques\" very common in forums and mainly used by trolls; this can be a source of frustration to users trying to have an honest debate. Can also be a source of laughs, not only for the trolls and others in on the ruse, but for other users following the argument. Once discovered, this is commonly used as another point against the user and/or another way to discredit their arguments.note\u00a0Of course, someone could always create fairly obvious sock puppets claiming to agree with the opposition for this very purpose, if they were a particularly Magnificent Bastard.\nSock puppets are banned in many online venues. Wikipedia is notoriously plagued with them; its \"anyone can edit\" philosophy makes it hard to keep them out, while its bureaucratic processes provide incentives for their creation.\nAd Hominem can occur if someone on the internet accuses another of being a sock puppet when the accused is actually providing an honest opinion of dissent and asking an honest question about accountability and credibility. This might be done by either trolls or as an example of Fan Dumb or Hate Dumb to not have to answer to a criticism or dissenting opinion while still discrediting the person that dissented.\nSee also AstroTurf and the second definition of Meat Puppet. Not to be confused with an actual Hand Puppet made from a sock. For when you're not sure whether the person is sincere or not, that's Poe's Law.\n"}
{"FauxAdventureStory": "A work of fiction that attracts the reader/viewer with the entourage of pulp adventures, superhero action, etc. in order to tell an entirely different story, which can be humorous and parodying the genre cliches, or darker and more serious in nature. For example, imagine that an Indiana Jones-style adventurer dies unexpectedly in the first part of the movie, and the rest of the story is about his loved ones coming to terms with his death? Or imagine that a Gotham-style megalopolis and a superhero defending it from organized crime is all in the head of a mental patient?\nBe careful though, as the viewer may feel cheated if the work is not what they both expected and paid for.\nA Sister Trope related to detective/mystery plots is Mockstery Tale (they may also overlap).\nLiterature\nVideo Games\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"RevengeFic": "When the fanfiction writer has a chip on their shoulder for whatever reason, and inflicts misery on a character perceived to deserve it. Often occurs when the character's role is incidental and the writer really just has a problem with the distinct personality type, or if the character is in the way of the writer's pairing of choice. Another name for it is Anti Fic, although this term implies a degree of clever and biting satire. This type of fic is more commonly referred to as Bashing Fic.\nIn some circles (such as the Anime Fan Fiction Mailing List), the term \"Revenge Fic\" can also refer to a story where the characters step out of the fictional realm to inflict some kind of revenge on the fanfiction author for the things he or she made them do. This can be a variety of Meta Fic, and somewhat impinges on and overlaps with the concept of Animated Actors.\nIf this is done by the original author, it might be Derailing Love Interests or a form of Creator Backlash. If done by a different official author in the same franchise, see Armed with Canon. If this is done because the character is in the way of the writer's pairing of choice, it's a case of Die for Our Ship. Can be closely allied to Oh Crap! There Are Fanfics of Us....\nIf it's for an entire series rather than a single character, it's a Hate Fic. Related to Take That, Scrappy! and Betrayal Fic.\n"}
{"HurtComfortFic": "Also known as \"whump\", a Hurt/Comfort Fic is a Fan Fic about comforting one who is hurt. Usually based on either Break The Stoic or Break the Cutie, often to the point of Woobiefication: a regular character is damaged, either emotionally or physically, and another character (usually the character's partner, love interest, a teammate, or a Mary Sue) must comfort them. This comfort can become\u2026 intense. Alternatively, the author can create a Sympathetic Sue to get damaged so the author's favorite canon character can comfort him/her. A story can take place after specific episodes or installments of canon, or else the writer creates a new predicament.\nVice versa, the above methods are often used by fanfiction authors as a way to pair up two characters that would otherwise be at each others' throats or have nothing to do with one another. Maybe the characters don't know each other too well, or maybe they wouldn't get along well under normal circumstances, but once they see that poor kid bleeding on their doorstep there isn't much alternative to taking them in and nurturing them back to health\u2026\nOften used as part of Shipping. Sometimes, Ron the Death Eater is responsible for the \"hurt\" part and Draco in Leather Pants is responsible for the \"comfort\" part. (In fact, the derivation implied by those Trope Namers is quite common, typically with Hermione on the receiving end.) At other times, the characters stick to canonical roles (if not canonical characterization). In cases of physical hurt, it may be accidental or deliberately inflicted, but almost always there's some reason given why the injured cannot be taken to get medical attention (at least at first), which would involve them being cared for by mere strangers (with medical training) rather than someone who cares.\nFanwriters love this device because it gives the characters a situation which they both must struggle to overcome, without having a lot of other characters or outside obstacles intruding. These types of fanfics will often be either sweet and fluffy or dramatized scenes in which the injured character lays out their entire tragic past for their rescuer to sympathize with, and more often than not transforms the characters' relationship from strained to romantic in ways that would not always fit with canon.\nCan be done well, if the affliction is realistic and the story is well-written. Done especially often in medical show fandoms and buddy shows.\nOften effective when combined with the Morality Pet, but ineffective when combined with Wimpification. Compare After-Action Patch-Up.\n"}
{"HexagonalSpeechBalloon": "Light-hearted moments in Anime are frequently set up by showing a long shot of the wider area around a group of characters (or a shot of a map of the area), with the characters appearing as talking heads within wobbly multi-colored hexagonal comic strip-style speech balloons. This frequently emphasizes the space that the characters must deal with: wilderness that they must cross, an entire neighbourhood that they must search, or so forth. It can also be used as a lower-budget way to show a group of people having conversations all at once.\nThis is, of course, a holdover from comic book panels, particularly Odd-Shaped Panel.\n"}
{"RangedEmergencyWeapon": "While most Emergency Weapons are close-ranged melee weapons in the hands of characters who normally fight at long range, sometimes the inverse happens and a character who specializes in primarily close-range fighting lands in a situation that cannot be resolved without some manner of long-range striking ability.\nThe Ranged Emergency Weapon is generally not very effective as an attack (it's usually not an actual gun or bomb), but it may be enough to, say, flip a door switch behind that open mesh grate.\nThis is fairly rare, mainly due to the story wanting to focus more on the melee action: If a guy is an awesome swordsman why make him use a gun or bow? Also, there's a tendency for good guys in fiction to be great shots whatever their melee skills. However, a handful of characters graduated from the Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy even as they kick ass at melee.\nIn movies, a character without such a weapon can always rely on Throwing Your Sword Always Works; unfortunately very few video games give you that option.\nContrast Punch-Packing Pistol, for when a sidearm is comparable or sometimes even superior to the main arsenal.\n"}
{"PowerupFullColorChange": "So, our heroes are fighting with The Dragon. The Action Girl activates her Limit Break and starts glowing violet. The Smart Guy unleashes his Dangerous Forbidden Technique and becomes all covered in green. Their combined attack badly damages The Dragon, but in response, he Turns Red - literally, as his transformation changes all his colors to red. But fear not! The Hero enters Super Mode with his body turning all gold from awesome power and is ready to unleash it all to deliver the final blow...\nA shapeshifting trope without an actual change in shape, this is when a character's transformation to a new form is indicated by a change in hair and clothing color, which is meant to symbolize the power. Sometimes, character is just shining with one-colored aura and sometimes, all his color temporary changes into that one. It's clear indicator for the audience that, that character is now getting stronger. And it looks damn cool.\nIt very often overlaps with Power Glows, especially in Super Robot shows, but there are cases of one that does not require the another.\nMay be a visual indication of Heroic RRoD, Super Mode, or Turns Red. Compare with Volcanic Veins, Tron Lines, Battle Aura, Power Tattoo, Mark of the Beast, Marked Change and Golden Super Mode. See also Colour-Coded for Your Convenience and Convenient Color Change.\n"}
{"PrincessinRags": "Usually female, this character has fallen from grace and refuses to go down without a fight. It is usually suggested she was once the Alpha Bitch, a Rich Bitch, or a Non-Royal Princess, and fell hard because of the loss of a family fortune, home, etc. However, instead of adapting to the new situation like the Fallen Princess, the character will either act the same as before, or become even more arrogant and cold, maintaining a Well, Excuse Me, Princess!, better-than-you attitude, while privately lamenting her lost fortune. Frequent Stepford Smiler, with good reason.\nIf she was known for her beauty and elegance, she will either continue to use the same hairstyle and clothes until the clothes become rags and the hairstyle becomes embarrassingly outdated, or else try to follow the current fashions by creative sewing of old clothes - or creative shopping, with highly variable success. If she has kids, she tends to mutate into My Beloved Smother, in her desperate attempt to make her kids successful enough to get back the lost status, usually attempting to get her girls to marry rich and her boys to select a \"prestigious\" profession such as lawyer, medical doctor, or, if the work is particularly old, religious minister or priest.\nOften seen in Latin American works, where this kind of character is almost archetypical. The sympathy with this character is treated depends of the writer, but more often than not they are presented as fighting a futile battle against the decadence they are destined to lose. For example, the character could go from being a Rich Bitch to The Woobie living in a Crapsack World of her own imagination, or from the Non-Royal Princess to an Anti-Villain.\nCompare Impoverished Patrician and King of the Homeless. Contrast Fallen Princess. She's not a Rebellious Princess but can be confused for one as she's rebelling against the force that's telling her she's no longer a princess.\n"}
{"EntropyAndChaosMagic": "Magic and powers with a \"chaotic\" theme. Often referred to as \"chaos magic\", \"wild magic\" (not to be confused with the Wild Magic trope) or, more fancifully, \"entropic magic\" or variants on that name. Sometimes appears in settings with an Order Versus Chaos cosmology, but can pop up anywhere.\nIt can function in many different ways, but frequent traits include: high randomness and uncontrollability, probability manipulation, and inducing accelerated decay and destruction, depending on how the writers understand the concept of chaos and entropy.\n\"Entropy\" in particular is one of these scientific concepts which appeals to writers due to its cool, sinister-sounding name and its association with decay. In real life, \"entropy\" is a physical concept, roughly defined as a measure of disorder and chaos of a given systemnote\u00a0Strictly speaking, entropy is a constant multiplied by log of the number of microstates (distribution of particles by states) corresponding to same observed macrostate (set of observed macroparameters) of the system.. Per the second law of thermodynamics, the entropy of an isolated system can only grow, never decrease; the only way to decrease the entropy is for some external force to do work on itnote\u00a0think about how a messy room will only get messier over time, and it takes someone deliberately cleaning up to restore it to a more ordered state. Since the universe itself (as far as we know) is an isolated system with no external forces that can affect it, this suggests that eventually it will succumb to \"heat death of the universe\": eventually all organized systems will break apartnote\u00a0 Ironically, despite people usually conflating this idea with chaos, the heat death of the universe will result in the most ordered state the universe has ever seen: a sea of matter stretching evenly and uniformly across the entire universe in all directions until the end of time. This is actually a basic fact about entropy, as higher entropy states tend to be more \"soupy\". Hence why chaos-based entities tend to have an Omnicidal Maniac vibe to them.\nChaos Magic also exists in real life. It is a Postmodern esoteric practice that eclectically borrows from older magical traditions in order to create new rituals. Notable Chaos Magicians who have incorporated it into their work include William S. Burroughs, Grant Morrison, Timothy Leary, and Die Antwoord. The other Wiki has more.\nMight be related to Antimatter, Power of the Void, and Casting a Shadow.\n"}
{"TwelveCoinsPuzzle": "In this Stock Puzzle, you are given a number of coins, or bags of coins, and a balance. You are told that one coin or bag is heavier or lighter than the others (in most versions of the puzzle, the odd-weight coins are counterfeit). Through a limited number of weighings, you must determine which coin or bag of coins is counterfeit.\nThe usual version is 12 coins (or bags, or whatever) with three weighings, which has several solutions, some more intuitive than others. It's easier if you know whether the counterfeits are heavier or lighter than the genuine coins, so in trickier versions of the puzzle you must figure this out as well. A third variation may give you 13 coins (but you know whether the counterfeits are heavier or lighter) - some of the 12-coins-unknown-weight solutions also work for this (simply leave the extra coin out, and then if it was the counterfeit, you'll figure that out in the three weighings). 13-coins-and-unknown-weight is not possible in the standard three weighings.\nIf you know whether the bad coins are heavier or lighter, the solution is to divide the coins into three groups of four coins each. Weigh group A against Group B. If they are balanced, the bad coin is in group C. If they do not balance, the bad coin is on the side corresponding to the description of the bad coin. (If it is heavier, the heavier side contains the bad coin; if the bad coin is lighter, the lighter side contains it.) Now take the coins in the group known to contain the bad coin and weigh two against two. Again one side will be off in the same direction in which the coin is bad: The counterfeit coin is one of those two. Weigh those two coins against each other.\nIf the more complicated version is used, and whether the bad coin is heavier or lighter is not known, the procedure is a little different and more complicated.\nThere are other solutions, some of them with spiffy mnemonics, e.g. here and here.\nInterestingly, if you know whether the odd coin is heavier or lighter, you can handle up to 27 coins in three weighings (weigh 9 against 9, then 3 against 3, then 1 against 1).note\u00a0Why not 28? Each weighing has only 3 possible results - left heavier, right heavier, equal - so the whole process has only 3*3*3 = 27 possible sets of results, no matter which coins you weigh each time. And a process is only guaranteed to work if each choice of odd coin leads to a different set of results. Each additional weighing triples the limit.\nAnother similar puzzle has you given a number of bags of coins and a mass measurement scale that you can use once, and being told that one bag's coins all weigh X and the rest all weigh Y. The solution for this one involves taking one coin from bag A, two coins from bag B, etc., and figuring out how much the resulting measurement differs from what you would get if all the coins weighed the same.\nAnime and Manga\nCard Games\nLiterature\nLive-Action Television\nVideo Games\n"}
{"TheNeiderMeyer": "The military equivalent of the Sadist Teacher.\nA commanding officer with zero respect for his troops, and probably plenty for himself. Because of his demonstrated incompetence, cowardice, inexperience, willingness to sacrifice his men for his own glory while keeping himself safely out of harm's way, an obsessive desire to get promoted, or just being a psychotic level hard-ass, his authority is resented by the men in the trenches, and his orders are only obeyed because chain-of-command says so.\nIn more upbeat war shows, he's usually forced to learn An Aesop about his awful command style and adjust his behavior in a way that either changes him into a likable officer or results in his resignation, demotion, or transfer to a more suitable post.\nIn more cynical war movies there will be no escape from the petty and obnoxious brute, and the men simply grouse and wait for the day someone on the opposing side will get lucky and catch him in the crosshairs. The troops might even conspire to frag him themselves if they get tired of waiting for the enemy to do the job.\nIf he is too tough to frag, though, the (un)lucky survivor of his tirades will become either a Yes-Man with no more backbone than he started off with, with a sense of \"loyalty\" to him, or The Dragon who seeks to become his successor when he dies/moves on. In a best case scenario, the successor may show much competence and merely view the man as a Cynical Mentor or Drill Sergeant Nasty, but not always. In this case, the other troops will remain as spiteful as ever, but find that the converted will easily take care of any sort of mutiny they try to pull off.\nA Drill Sergeant Nasty just acts like one, with the purpose of turning recruits into soldiers. A Sergeant Rock may act like one, but is nonetheless held in high regard because he wouldn't put his men through anything he wouldn't go through himself. The Neidermeyer may believe he is either or both.\nIf he's a crusty, tough-as-nails long-term veteran commanding officer who has lost touch with reality and is filled with irrational hatred and paranoia against a specific foe, he's a General Ripper.\nSee also Miles Gloriosus for a broader application of this trope.\nThis trope goes often goes hand in hand with The Peter Principle: the leader has simply advanced to a level too much for his capabilities.\nThe polar opposite of this trope is \"A Father to His Men\" (into which the Neidermeyer may well evolve). In many cases, a General Failure is basically a Neidermeyer with greater rank and thus even more scope for causing damage. If the Neidermeyer is a temporary replacement for the usual Reasonable Authority Figure, it may also be a Tyrant Takes the Helm story. The Sister Trope - a low-ranking leader, such as non-commissioned officer, lacking in authority or hated by his men is Gung Holier Than Thou.\nNamed after the infamous blowhard ROTC commander Doug Neidermeyer from the movie Animal House.\nFun fact: \"Neider\" in German means \"Envier\", making Neidermeyer's name a Meaningful Name.\nCompletely unrelated to the founding editor of CurbsideClassic.com.\n"}
{"DetectiveStory": "Detective Drama is a type of Mystery Fiction that follows the cases of a central detective character as they investigate a crime, usually from initial investigation to arrest. The character is usually a police detective or Private Detective, but can also be an Amateur Sleuth or even a Kid Detective with acute sleuthing skills.\nThere are two varieties of Detective Drama, which correspond to the two basic types of mystery: closed and open. In a \"closed\" mystery, the viewer is as in the dark as the detective (and maybe moreso), and only learns the answer to the mystery when the detective reveals it. In an \"open\" mystery (Reverse Whodunnit), the viewer has an omniscient view of the plot and knows the solution to the mystery; the entertainment value comes from watching the detective unravel it.\nFor common types of detectives, see Cops and Detectives.\nFor a list of related tropes, see Mystery Tropes and Crime and Punishment Tropes. For a list of creators, see Mystery Story Creator Index.\n"}
{"OrderReborn": "Long ago, there existed an order of people who battled evil valiantly but have since fallen into disarray and were ultimately forgotten. But as the ancient evil rises its head again, a new group of heroes will take up the fallen banner of their ancestors and defend the world that they passed down to them in their name.\nThe Order Reborn is a reincarnation of an extinct heroic organization that has been forgotten over time but resurrected by the distant successors to combat evil, new or old. It is probably based on the old principles but (ideally) with adjustments made to prevent it from meeting the same end.\nUsually precipitated by the Last of His Kind, who will become The Mentor. The \"order\" being rebuilt is often The Chosen Many. A subtrope of The Order. Compare with Putting the Band Back Together. For this trope on nation-wide scale, see Resurgent Empire.\n"}
{"TheInvisibleBand": "Sometimes musicians are... facially unfortunate. It's not their fault, but that doesn't mean you should pander to them by putting them in the video, oh no. After all, who wants to watch a bunch of ugly, hairy types leaping around when you can replace them with oiled-up catalogue models and whiz-bang CGI.\nAs a result you get videos in which the people who made the music are conspicuously absent, having been replaced with any number of other, more visually interesting things.\nThis is particularly popular in dance music videos; since dance music fans tend to buy songs they like rather than stick closely to any particular artist, there's less impetus to build up a \"brand\" by making the artist's face (and name) well-known. Additionally, as the artist very rarely contributes vocals there's very little reason to have them on-camera.\nNot to be confused with a Travis album. Compare Anonymous Band, where the musicians can be seen but their physical appearance is downplayed rather than hidden.\n"}
{"TastesBetterThanItLooks": "We all know not to judge a book by its cover, but what about food? Chances are, if something smells and looks repulsive, it'll taste just as bad. After all, how could that plate of green eggs be anything other than rotten, or that bowl of murky, gray mush be anything other than nauseating? This is especially true if we're expected to taste something that isn't often eaten in our culture, such as a middle-class American being fed a bat\u2014or a normal human being exposed to an Alien Lunch. In many cases, a bad smell, texture, or appearance will be an immediate sign that the food should not be eaten, for our own safety. After all, who really wants to eat a Mess on a Plate?\nAnd sometimes, our senses will be lying to us. That bowl of bat wings will be the best thing the American has ever tasted, that gray mush will turn out to be a very rare and delicious type of soup, and someone will discover that they really do like green eggs and ham. Characters who decide to be open-minded will be rewarded with a delicious meal and may be pleasantly surprised that someone they thought was a Lethal Chef is actually a skilled chef whose presentation just needs some work. They may learn An Aesop about trying new things while they're at it.\nLike I Do Not Like Green Eggs and Ham (which covers more than just food), the character carries some preconceived notion that they will hate the thing, but they eventually try it and realize they were wrong. In this case, though, the thing genuinely doesn't look appetizing to begin with.\nMay overlap with Foreign Queasine and Cordon Bleugh Chef, if the prepared food is gross-looking to someone, but they end up liking it after they try it. The food may Taste Like Chicken. See also If It Tastes Bad, It Must Be Good for You, where a character makes assumptions about food based on its taste rather than appearance.\n"}
{"SpectralWeaponCopy": "A specific Weapon of Choice \u2014 whatever it is \u2014 that is not original.\nThis doesn't refer to said weapon being a Shoddy Knockoff Product, but rather, the weapon is a copy made from Applied Phlebotinum, like Hard Light, Elemental Powers, Life Force or what have you.\nSometimes it is possible for the user to create multiple copies at once, and make a literal Storm of Blades or Flechette Storm with it.\nOften overlaps with Spontaneous Weapon Creation. Sometimes a subtrope of Shaping Your Attacks.\nCompare Self-Duplication when the thing being copied is yourself. As well as Laser Blade, Flaming Sword and Energy Weapon for other weapons that are noncoporeal.\n"}
{"BigBoosHaunt": "The place where the dead come back to annoy you. This is the haunted area in the game with unconventional, undead enemies that can only be defeated through certain means. With ghosts, they might not be beatable at all. With zombies and vampires, it might require exposure to reflective sunlight or casting healing spells or special spells in RPGs. May be a depiction of \u00dcberwald, or a Haunted House. It'll probably always be nighttime in this level.\nThe Big Boo's Haunt is a very versatile setting. This area will frequently cross with another location, like a mansion, cemetery, temple,\nforest, or an underground mine \u2014 there's no quicker way to make an area creepier than to make it haunted. Often it also has inconsistent lighting.\nLet's face it \u2014 a good scare is always nice.\nNamed after the stage from Super Mario 64. It may overlap with Unholy Ground. Its sister trope is the Bleak Level, a suddenly gloomy and depressing stage in an otherwise upbeat game.\n"}
{"LineageComesfromtheFather": "Maybe it's because Most Writers Are Male, but when a character has a legacy of royalty, villainy or heroics it tends to come from the father. The implicit assumption is that if a character is going to inherit something of relevance from their bloodline, it's going to be from their father's side, never their mother's. This is applied to both sons and daughters.\nThis is often paired with Single Line of Descent, creating a long line of fathers and sons. Likewise, the prevalence of this trope is a contributor to Human Mom Nonhuman Dad having the supernatural partner be the father. Compare the similar trope Never a Self-Made Woman, where important female characters ultimately owe their positions or talents to men. It may be an In-Universe reason why Nature Adores a Virgin, and why My Girl Is Not a Slut, especially if the Daddy DNA Test does not exist. The idea is that it's important to know whose kids are whose, and therefore, it's important that one's wife never have slept with anyone else, usually tied to an even bigger concept that Men Act, Women Are.\nIn the matter in question is legal inheritance, you're looking at its sister trope Heir Club for Men. Lineage Comes from the Father is concerned with the less traditional \"inheritance\"\u2014for example, villainy or heroics, rather than a title or money.\nThe prevalence of this trope is such that most examples will be subversions.\nIn the case of a Matriarchy or otherwise matrilineal society, this trope is automatically gender-inverted.\n"}
{"StudentTeacherRomance": "It is a pretty good bet that just about any show that features adults and teens interacting in an academic environment will eventually explore a romantic relationship between a teacher and a student. The basis for this type of relationship \u2014 if it's actually a romance and not just a Sextra Credit arrangement \u2014 can either be the adoration and respect toward the teacher/mentor figure or the teacher's protective and caring instincts, or both. The illicit, forbidden, and most often scandalous nature of these relationships can be mined for angst, and generally doesn't cause real life issues because the actors themselves are generally all above the age of consent thanks to Dawson Casting. But even if the student is eighteen or in college, this sort of extracurricular activity would still be a massive breach of professional ethics in most of the world and in some jurisdictions is considered illegal, regardless of age, in some circumstances (some teachers have been charged for relationships with high school students, even if the relationship didn't begin until after the student turned 18 and the teacher her/himself was only a few years older). Even if it was not illegal, the scandal that would erupt from this socially unacceptable affair would be so devastating it would basically cost a teacher or professor his or her job forever.\nThere are usually different levels of moral endorsement of the relationship, depending on the genders of the participants. Relationships between male teachers and male students are condemned the most harshly. When a male teacher and a female student are together it results in the teacher being viewed as a pervert and sometimes the student being slut shamed. When it's the other way around, a female teacher with a male or even a female student is taken far less seriously. An even more outrageous double standard is that emphasis is often placed on how attractive said female teacher is \u2014 the more attractive said teacher, the more acceptable the relationship is. That said, the trope in fiction probably will involve a Hot Teacher, if only for fanservice purposes.\nAn author might attempt to make this relationship less squicky by having the student fulfill the Wise Beyond Their Years trope, by keeping things to Courtly Love only, or by making both participants older \u2014 a graduate or doctoral student falling in love with their professor is less likely to cause moral outrage than a high school student doing the same thing due to both participants being adults, though the professional ethics of the situation remain pretty much the same.\nThe relationship may be initiated by a Fille Fatale. A subtrope of Unequal Pairing. Compare Mrs. Robinson. See Likes Older Men, Likes Older Women, and Stacy's Mom for young people lusting after older people in general, Precocious Crush for a more innocent variant, Age-Gap Romance for when there's a significant age difference between them, and Mentor Ship. There's a version specific to magic users called Merlin and Nimue, which takes its cue from the Arthurian Mythos where Merlin formed such a pair with several women. Teacher/Parent Romance occurs when a teacher falls for their student's parent.\nThis group of tropes is among The Oldest Ones in the Book. Although generally frowned upon in Real Life today, it's had varying levels of acceptance throughout history. It was most famously acceptable in Ancient Greece, where it took the form of Lover and Beloved.\n"}
{"AllowedInternalWar": "In some works of speculative fiction the overarching authority of a nation has so little direct control over its provinces or client states that they occasionally go to open war with one another and the king can't do a thing to stop it. They might even openly condone it. So long as they follow the rules of course.\nTends to be a standard part of feudal governments, futuristic or otherwise. Interpreted figuratively, it is viewed as a dissent-limiting tactic in Real Life; in the words of Noam Chomsky: \"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum....\"\n"}
{"MostCommonSuperPower": "Whether the superheroine/villainess is a mutant, an Amazon princess or an alien humanoid, if she's female, she is straining against the bonds of gravity... but not in a flying sort of way.\nThis most common of metahuman attributes seems to range from a D-cup size upward for any character just past the onset of puberty (a time when many comic-book characters start to manifest superpowers). They are not only large, but remarkably self-supporting and perky for their size. This can be justified if their power set is such that the tendons supporting the breasts would be stronger or more elastic than normal.\nCommon because Most Artists Are Male, of course, which is why this rarely involves My Eyes Are Up Here.\nAlso, if one checks out the many \"How To\" books on comic book art, the average artist makes a point that American superheroes are drawn \"larger than life\". Heroes (and some villains) are supposed to look dynamic and impressive, so women are drawn with a dynamic and impressive bust. Another reason that superheroine cup sizes increased over the years is the larger roles the teen superhero achieved after the popularity of Spider-Man; a more \"mature\" body helps identify an adult heroine vs. a teen. Of course, many teen heroines exploit this trope nowadays as well.\nLive Action Adaptations inevitably lead to a Big Bra to Fill.\nA Sub-Trope of Heroic Build.\nCompare Form-Fitting Wardrobe, Stripperiffic, Gag Boobs, Gainaxing, Boobs of Steel, Cleavage Window, World of Buxom, Buxom Is Better (open preference for large chests), Top-Heavy Guy (a male exaggerated torso). See also I Have Boobs, You Must Obey!.\nFor tropes related to actual common superpowers, see Stock Superpowers.\nPlease limit examples to justifications, lampshades, and Played for Laughs.\n"}
{"SwordandFist": "Similar to Sword and Gun, where the character shoots you with a gun in-between slashing at you with a sword, this is about characters who punctuate attacks using a weapon (not necessarily a sword) with unarmed punches and kicks. For the purpose of sorting out more fantastic examples, anything that a Bare-Fisted Monk can do counts as \"unarmed attack\".\nThis trope has a firm basis in reality: while fictional warriors tend to perfect the use of a single weapon, Real Life swordsmen and fencers would rarely limit themselves to using the sword when kicks, punches, shoves and grapplings did the job. Getting so distracted with the weapons that you forget about your other options is a grievous mistake. See European Swordsmanship for more info.\nSubtrope of Choice of Two Weapons. It's often a sign of a Combat Pragmatist. For characters who switch between armed and unarmed combat (but don't use both in combination), see Multi-Melee Master. Compare also the Gun Counterpart \u2014 Gun Fu (sort of).\n"}
{"Wildcard": "The Wild Card is so used to swinging between teams that they have no default \"good\" or \"evil\" Character Alignment or even a \"home team.\" They truly aren't interested in consistently remaining with either side, and will very often simply want both to leave them alone. They can be the sort of person who will stay out of things entirely, until someone else (usually the hero or other sympathetic character) asks them for help.\nThe Wild Card doesn't care whose toes they stomp on, even if they're supposed to be the Wild Card's own team. In fact, The Hero probably got one (if they even manage to convince one) onto the team only because the Wild Card owes them big time. The Wild Card can really shake up a team\u2014the more suspicious characters will quite rightly not trust them.\nWild Cards often share a few of these traits:\nSometimes Wild Cards fall in love. Love is the bane of the Wild Card, because no longer does the world revolve around one amazing and easy to understand person\u2014there's somebody else. Oh my god, What Is This Feeling?! Knowing how erratic the Wild Card can be, it could be somebody from either team\u2014or both. With somebody to care about, the Wild Card may well become more reliable for a team. Or if there's multiple people to care about, they may become less reliable. There are also some Wild Cards who became what they are because they fell in love with someone.\nWild Cards are very rarely Big Bads, though; they aren't really dedicated enough to evil\u2014or to anything\u2014to be that evil. However much they may enjoy doing what they do, most Wild Cards have either some form of morality, or high survival instincts, and are likely to turn on their evil employer because they were betrayed, don't want to be blown up with the planet, or even just because they just don't like being that evil. Wild Cards are more likely to be a Big Bad's poor choice of Bastard Understudy, or even the Good Team's Token Evil Teammate.\nWhile the average Wild Card sees their \"friends\" as a handy Bulletproof Human Shield, they have just enough conscience to feel bad about abandoning them when the fight turns ugly. No Wild Card switches teams because they care about their friends\u2014they switch teams because it means a better life for them.\nOn rare occasions, a Wild Card may unexpectedly pull a sudden act of Heroic Sacrifice, though it'll likely be because they guessed that if they didn't sacrifice themselves, they'd probably die anyway\u2014along with everybody else.\nOr they might not.

{"AbilityRequiredToProceed": "One way to control the plot of a video game is to place barriers in the hero's path. A destination may be unreachable without access to water transport because the main character has Super Drowning Skills. You may need to become immune to fire before moving on because the next level is set in a Fire and Brimstone Hell environment. Perhaps you need to enlist the help of a specific NPC, or acquire a specific item, in order to get past the annoying guard.\nSometimes, the item, ability, or skill isn't needed again. But, in other cases, it becomes a key part of the main character's inventory, and gets used all the time. Another example: you can't get to the other island without a ship, so any plot event that happens on the other island can assume you have a ship. Thus, the game developers suddenly start throwing quests at you that require you to hop back and forth between islands like a bored tourist, and continue to do so for the rest of the game. In extreme cases, the entire game dynamic may change after you obtain this one critical item or ability, because you are now well-equipped/powerful enough to handle challenges that would have been insurmountable before.\nThis is a subtrope of Broken Bridge. While Broken Bridges railroad you to the plot by requiring that you complete certain tasks before new areas open up, this trope is about railroading you to the plot by requiring that you have the necessary skills and abilities to move forward and open up new areas. This trope is a staple of the Metroidvania genre of video games, though it shows up in other genres as well.\nSee also But Thou Must!. For something that requires you to be at a certain level to proceed before it kills you, see Beef Gate. When this is combined with an offensive ability it's a Utility Weapon.\n"}
{"Antimagic": "The ability to completely negate magic or other supernatural effects. The power is not absorbed or reflected, it simply ceases to be when it comes within the radius of effect. This will usually be an extremely rare, nigh-unheard of, game-breaking power: the greatest of wards become undone with incredible ease, with unforeseen effects.\nIt can be Blessed with Suck if this means White Magic doesn't work on you either. No magical healing or protection in this case. If the world runs on Magic, this person may be a pariah, especially if it's a power that they can't control.\nGroups of people who make use of this ability generally exist for the purpose of stopping magic-users; they may be an Anti-Magical Faction, Witch-Hunters, Vampire Hunters (in the event that vampires use magic, which they usually do) or just regular old Mage Killers. Depending on how magic is viewed in the setting, they may be seen as heroes or villains.\nFor an item that keeps the enemy from using their abilities for a period of time, see Power Nullifier. For stopping a specific spell while it's being cast with another spell, see Counterspell. For reversing the effects of magic, see Dispel Magic. Similarly, the Kryptonite-Proof Suit can be used to resist the Kryptonite Factor. Compare Walking Techbane, where someone has this effect on scientific technology. Contrast No-Sell, when characters can ignore (rather than nullify) the powers of others or their defenses. Mage Killers often weaponize this ability. Un Sorcerers often have this; in fact, that might be why their own powers don't work. Contrast Weak To Magic.\n"}
{"LegacyHero": "You just can't keep a good character down. Even in a setting where Death Is a Slap on the Wrist, a hero can't keep his heroics up forever (nor do most want to) and even if super-villains and world-spanning disasters can't kill him, old age definitely will. But while a man can't beat the Reaper forever, the identity he holds is contained in a vessel consisting of little more than a name and a mask, meaning that if he cannot continue his Legacy, someone else can.\nA Legacy Character is a character whose identity is passed down to them from an older character in the form of a title, job or persona for the newer character to assume. There are many ways this can come about:\nOutside of the work, Legacy Characters are especially popular as superheroes and action heroes, or any job that involves a Secret Identity. Long-Runners that span multiple generations of characters are the most likely to use them, but they can also be created as part of a back-story, such as a Secret Legacy.\nAdaptations of a work with Legacy Characters to other media often only reference the current or best known holder of the legacy, only referencing other incarnations as a Mythology Gag. Younger heroes carrying the mantle often get a Rogues Gallery to match their predecessors, either via villains having kids of their own (much to the parent's chagrin), or younger villains \"honoring\" their own villainous legacy.\nThis may become Generation Xerox if everyone around the Legacy Character is also a Legacy Character. If the Legacy Character is a descendant (probably because Lamarck Was Right), you've got yourself a Spin-Offspring. If he's a former sidekick, it's Sidekick Graduations Stick. If an already existing superhero takes the legacy, it may end up as a Second Super-Identity.\nEvery now and again, a former incarnation of a Legacy Character may, for whatever reason, return and try to reacquire that mantle/legacy. If a character is introduced as a temporary legacy to get him an audience before giving the legacy back, its a Legacy Launch.\nMany involve a formal moment of Passing the Torch, when the older character hands over responsibility to the younger, or a Take Up My Sword moment, if the older character dies. This is also convenient in creating change without actually fundamentally changing a title character's book. If people within the universe don't realize that there's a new man behind the mask and thus start spreading rumors he can't die, he's got Legacy Immortality.\nIn recent years, passing the torch to a minority character has become a popular choice.\nSubtrope of Eternal Hero and Villainous Legacy.\nSee also Dying to Be Replaced. Compare The Nth Doctor, Collective Identity, Legacy of the Chosen. If the young character, parent, and grandparent each make a unique name for themselves instead of passing down a persona it's Three Successful Generations. If the character is a vessel instead of a person, see Legacy Vessel Naming.\n"}
{"JerkAssFacade": "The character acts like either a heartless bastard or otherwise obnoxious Jerkass when they really aren\u2019t.\nTheir reasons might be because they are afraid to get intimate with other people because they simply assume that the person will either die or betray them just like everyone else they have ever gotten close to. It might be because the person is being stalked by horrible demons, The Mafia, The Government, or some other dangerous and unstoppable entity and does not want to drag others into it. Maybe they\u2019re pulling off a Zero-Approval Gambit and/or Genghis Gambit. In more light-hearted media, maybe they just feel they have a reputation to uphold as a Jerkass. So rather than letting anyone get close to them, they behave like a completely obnoxious douche bag to scare them all away from wanting anything to do with them.\nCompare with Stepford Snarker, Sour Outside, Sad Inside and Jerk with a Heart of Gold.\nContrast Bitch in Sheep's Clothing and Jerk with a Heart of Jerk. See also It's Not You, It's My Enemies, Defrosting Ice Queen, Think Nothing of It, Don't You Dare Pity Me! and Monster Fa\u00e7ade. May secretly be a Zero-Approval Gambit.

{"KeepCirculatingTheTapes": "There once was a show. You know, that show. It was a really good show. Or maybe it was something else. Still, you'd love to relive the memories, and share it with your friends.\nThere's just one problem: It's impossible.\nWatch and record reruns? Of course you would...if it were on.\nBuy the DVD? You'd already have it on pre-order...if it existed.\nNetflix? Hulu? iTunes? Not there.\nWhat's a fan to do? It isn't that you're setting out to break copyright law...you'd be more than happy to pay to acquire it legally! At the same time, though, you realize that the market is too niche for a super-deluxe bells-and-whistles compilation DVD to be justifiably profitable... no matter how many online petitions your forum sends.\nKeep Circulating The Tapes (a phrase attributed to Mystery Science Theater 3000) is an option of last resort. It's when a show you like is denied to you, except through methods of questionable legality \u2014 shady file-sharing sites, tape trading/buying... it's either that, or the show's likely to be lost outside of fan recordings and film company archives. It's also the rule rather than the exception for video games and other non-simple media, to the point where the Abandonware concept and emulation were created to bring common sense into the situation (the Virtual Console, Playstation Network, GameTap, Steam, GOG.com, and to a smaller extent Xbox Live Arcade are finally starting to remedy this situation with games, but it's still a long way to go).\nJust try not to be angry that you can get the complete Brady Bunch Variety Hour, Van-Pires, The PJs, Robot and Monster, Making Fiends, Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place and T.J. Hooker on DVD but not Sanjay and Craig (post-season 1), Muppet Babies (1984), Our Miss Brooks, Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?, The Raccoons, Recess, KaBlam!, Fame (post-season 2), Shining Time Station, The Drew Carey Show (post-season 1), Murphy Brown (post-season 1), Cold Case, Fillmore!, The Hogan Family, Sheep in the Big City, Roundhouse, Kids Incorporated, Free Spirit, The Replacements, Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi (in its entirety), You Can't Do That on Television, or the original cut of Frosty the Snowmannote\u00a0the one with all of June Foray's dialog intact (among others).\nAfter steam stops shooting out of your ears, the question you're asking is probably... why? Well, a typical answer is that the television companies (correctly or incorrectly) don't think there's enough of a market for it to be worth releasing them, but it's not always their fault... directly. An all-too-common cause is music rights. Mission Hill halfway fell victim to this with the show released to DVD, but most of the popular music was omitted and replaced with Countdown Singers-esque soundalikes. Baby Blues wasn't as lucky; its DVD release may never see the light of day due to the theme being \"It's All Been Done\" by the Barenaked Ladies. Royalties play a large part in it.\n...this requires some explanation.\nThe tape circulators could've probably hazarded a guess, but absolutely nobody else saw the TV-on-DVD boom coming. TV on VHS had been tried, sure, but it wasn't even barely successful for even music-compilation heavyweights like Time-Life and Columbia House for several reasons:\n(It might be noted that this describes the US much more so than the UK, perhaps due in part to British Brevity meaning that a single series doesn't take up as much shelf space, and perhaps due to the lesser spread of cable TV. Nevertheless other reasons have brought this trope into force for many shows.)\nEven after the first wave started (thank HBO, specifically The Sopranos, for popularizing this wonderful thing of ours), they didn't sell nearly as well as they do now because of their frankly outrageous prices compared to today's. Additionally, copyright law is low, spooky voodoo, and licensing something like a song for your show, licensing it for reruns, and licensing it for home video are not the same thing. And nobody wanted to pay more money for something that they would, in all likelihood, never use (\"Television shows? On home video? By the season? Nonsense.\"). So here we are.\nThese situations are usually caused by licensing issues (Performance Licensing and Reproduction Licensing). In a nutshell, performance licensing is much easier to obtain (the licensing agencies get 3% of the DVD's revenue, in exchange for letting the distributors use a performance). Reproduction licensing is much more difficult to obtain, and can often involve long drawn-out negotiations with rights holders (sometimes many at once, and much worse if it was an older work that used many unlicensed tracks or clips). There are ways to get around these snags - cover versions of songs are considerably easier to get clearance for, and offending clips can sometimes be removed without impacting the narrative. Of course, if the show has no song rights issues, and the copyright holder's threatening legal action over your online copies of a show they haven't allowed you to buy legally... resume violent rage.\nIt gets worse: VHS tapes start degrading within 10-25 years. If a show stuck in limbo only circulates on homemade VHS copies and does not get transferred on another storage medium or uploaded online in time, it could very well become lost outside of restricted-access film archives.\nCompare No Export for You and Missing Episode. May also happen as the net result of Screwed by the Network, especially while new episodes of said show are airing elsewhere. Whatever the reason, if the show has a small but sizable fanbase, these fans turn to the Internet when any of these occurs, and if there's no official DVD release... well, their cries for help are heard by sympathizers and this Trope results. See also The Shelf of Movie Languishment and the Lost Media Wiki.\nSee also Archive Team and the Wayback Machine if the figurative lost tape you're looking for just so happens to be a website or some other form of internet content. You can also try out some subreddits here and there, especially the ones whose especial focus is to archive things, like DataHoarder, but we don't guarantee that'll work.\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: When posting a show, if you know where the show can be illegally obtained, don't post it. Just say that copies exist out there on the Internet, and leave it at that. (Think of it this way: if the link becomes too popular, it might get taken down. You also wouldn't want TV Tropes Wiki to get sued for blatantly promoting piracy, would you?)\nAnd please accept our apologies if you thought this trope was about a certain creepy woman in a well.\n"}
{"RuleSixtyThree": "For every given male character, there is a female version of that character, and vice versa.\nThey may be canonical. Most of them aren't. The internet has a fascination for producing gender swapping regardless of the context of the original character. Canon-derived examples of the trope tend to outlast their actual-canon inspirations (which are often single stories, or even short throwaway gags.)\nNo character is immune to this effect \u2014 not Darth Vader, not Master Chief \u2014 no one. note\u00a0Not even Chuck Norris. Rule 61 lied to you.\nClosely related to Gender Flip. When a separate character is a female knock-off of an existing male character, you have a Distaff Counterpart. Crossdressers, of course, provide their own version of this. There's a good chance that you'll see the character in question in a Gendered Outfit (like our lovely Maria at right, here).\nOne of the Rules of the Internet. Can (and often does) overlap with Rule 34. Since these female versions are often much cuter than their male counterparts, it can also overlap with Self-Fanservice and Fan Disservice.\n"}
{"HistoricalInjoke": "Happens when a show references a historical event, and provides additional information about the event, relating it to the show. This either changes the meaning of the event, or shows what really caused it, as opposed to what everyone thinks really happened.\nDonald P. Bellisario, the producer/creator of Quantum Leap, called these \"kisses with history\".\nGiven the painful lack of research that most writers perform before writing, it should come as no surprise that many Historical In-Jokes are painfully inaccurate anachronisms. Or they may be taken for being fiction by the audience.\nThe most common variation is that the characters are responsible for some famous bit of damage: Venus de Milo's arms, The Sphinx's nose, etc. Usually these are shown to occur when the artifacts are new, even if the real damage occurred much later.\nNaturally will involve a Historical-Domain Character or two.\nWhen this occurs in an Alternate History setting it's a case of Allohistorical Allusion.\nCompare It Will Never Catch On and This Is Going to Be Huge. A character who does a lot of these becomes Been There, Shaped History. If the protagonists blunder into a famous event instead of interfering deliberately, this can also be evidence that In the Past, Everyone Will Be Famous. For jokes which now need to be explained to be found funny, see Unintentional Period Piece. Naturally, this is a form of In-Joke.\nSubtropes include:\nCompare with Hitler's Time Travel Exemption Act, which frequently inverts this.\n"}
{"LawOfCartographicalElegance": "So you've gotten on the boat and want to explore the world. Perhaps you even brought a world map with you, and want to see where you're going before you actually get there. It's usually only a world map for the following reason: every land mass fits nicely within the square, never crossing the edges on either axis.\nSince everything's placed in the center, the edges of the map serve one of two purposes:\nSeen in almost any video game that uses a world map where the player can freely travel.\nFantasy World Maps also frequently obey the Law Of Cartographical Elegance.\nIt should be noted that this trope can be blamed on actual maps of earth which also happened to be set up in such a way that the only land masses that actually cross over the edges are Antarctica and the Chukchi Peninsula. Of course, there is good reason for this since it'd be rather inconvenient to read a map that is cut in half but in any case, an acceptable break from reality.\nSubtrope of Video Game Geography.\nPlatformers\nRole-Playing Games\nAction-Adventure Games\nDriving Games\nPlatform Games\nRole-Playing Games\nSimulation Games\nTabletop Games\nWide Open Sandbox\nAdventure Games\nMiscellaneous Games\nPlatformers\nReal-Time Strategy\nRole-Playing Games\nTurn-Based Strategy\n"}
{"JettisonJetpackAttack": "A character lets go of the Jetpack he/she is wearing as a desperate or cunning attack against enemies. Given the combustible contents of the jetpack, it can become an effective explosive weapon if not a powerful projectile, or a distracting explosion. Alternatives include a detachable fuel tank of a vehicle.\nCompare with Weaponized Exhaust, which weaponizes the jetpack without losing it, Ramming Always Works, which is about running a vehicle into a target (usually another vehicle) to damage or destroy it, and Outfit Decoy, which is about distracting enemies by taking off an article of clothing.\nAlso see Made of Explodium, in case you were wondering why the jetpack explodes on contact instead of simply making a very large dent in whatever it hit, and Suicide Attack, if the character is killed while still wearing the jetpack in the attack.

{"AmazingTechnicolourWildlife": "Sometimes, humans in animation and video games have decidedly non-standard skin colors. Instead of being tan and brown, they'll be green, gray, and purple. But they're not the only ones\u2014sometimes, animators have a bit of fun when designing animals as well. And thus, the world is filled with Amazing Technicolor Wildlife.\nAnimals are a bit different from humans\u2014a lot of them do come in wilder, more flamboyant colors, especially in tropical areas. Animals use bright colors as a way of saying \"Don't eat me! I'm poisonous!\" or \"Look at me! Aren't I a sexy beast?,\" or even for reasons we're not quite sure of. However, not all animals come in strange colors\u2014a lot of mammals tend to be the same grayish and yellowish and brownish and reddish colors we humans are, with the brightest colors reserved for birds, insects, and fish. (A few reptiles here and there, too.) And while no one would bat their eye at a blue peacock with green tailfeathers, a red peacock with bright purple tail feathers would be distinctly more unusual. For instance, there is no green in mammals (unless you count fur tinted green because of algae) and blue is only found in a few mammal species (unless you count greyish-blue or a blue sheen). It just doesn't exist naturally. Funny Animals in particular seem to be prone to this through Typical Cartoon Animal Colors but turned Up to Eleven.\nSometimes animators exaggerate the range of colors, patterns, and markings found on each species of animal in Real Life. Several species of penguin, like the Fairy Penguin\u25ca, have a naturally blue sheen to their feathers, but many animated penguins tend to be bright blue. There are other accepted variants from the range of colors, markings, and patterns each species of animal can have in Real Life, like solid-colored, non-tabby red cats.\nOther times, they're outright strange. Blue dogs, pink rabbits, orange sharks, and teal-colored platypodes abound.\nLittle songbirds which are dull-colored in Real Life may be depicted as brightly colored; in a more subtle version, crows and ravens are often shown with yellow beaks and feet, though retaining their all-black plumage.\nYou Gotta Have Blue Hair as it pertains to humans and sometimes Petting Zoo People.\nOverlaps with Typical Cartoon Animal Colors, can be subject to Hair Color Dissonance where the non-natural colour is adjusted to something more natural by the viewer's mind. Completely unrelated to Pink Elephants, although this trope may cause people to think that that trope or Mushroom Samba is in play.\n"}

Most Fan Fic also originates on the web, but some readers may reckon fan fic as a category apart from web original given its derivative nature.

See New Media Tropes for tropes specific to these media.\nNote that Web Serial Novels are now placed in the Literature namespace, and not here.\n"}
{"ManEater": "The (legal, and less repulsive than the better-known types) sexual predator \u2014 a man who relentlessly pursues, lands, loves, and then abandons members of the opposite sex, a skill bestowed upon him to demonstrate what a badass he is. Sometimes comic, sometimes a monster, always successful, this character leaves behind a string of broken hearts, and occasional vows of revenge that are rarely fulfilled. Casanova's only motivation is indulging his lust and desire, sating them with the bodies of his conquests.\nThis trope tends to suffer from three double standards when portrayed in media;\nContrast with the unsuccessful Casanova Wannabe. Compare with the inexplicable Kavorka Man. A guy who gets the girls like a Casanova, but unintentionally, is a Chick Magnet. If kind-hearted, may overlap with Chivalrous Pervert. The Charmer is equally charming but less sex-obsessed. If they really get around but want to settle down, it's Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places. A Handsome Lech has more negative connotations and a sparser scorecard than the Casanova.\nThe trope is named for Giacomo Casanova (1725-1798), a soldier, spy, diplomat, adventurer, and librarian whose extensive but unreliable autobiography (in which he almost literally described himself as God's Gift to Womennote\u00a0\"Feeling that I was born for the sex opposite of mine, I have always loved it and done all that I could to make myself loved by it.\") established his eternal fame as a lover. It should be noted that the historical Casanova was closer to a Chivalrous Pervert who really was looking for love... just with women who were locked in loveless political marriages \u2014 and also gained his successes famously ugly. (Definitely\u25ca he was no Heath Ledger\u25ca.) Interesting and prone to be noted for his modern wannabes, he was one of the few 18th century men who bathed almost daily and asked the same thing from his partners.\nMany films, TV movies and TV mini-series are named for and based on that person. The best known are Fellini's 1976 film, the 2005 film starring Heath Ledger, and the 2005 BBC drama mini-series starring David Tennant. The latter is considered one of the more faithful adaptations of Casanova's memoirs, while Fellini's... wasn't.\nFor the juvenile version \u2014 all of the above without the sex \u2014 see Kid-anova. Contrast the Serial Romeo (who falls in love with a long succession of women, one at a time and for reasonable periods). If the guy is actually only rumored to be a Casanova and has no evidence onscreen, it's the Urban Legend Love Life. If he develops feelings for one of his conquests (or someone who refuses him), he's a Ladykiller in Love. See More Friends, More Benefits for when the mechanics of a game encourage the player character to act this way.\nNote: It should be mentioned that even after the affairs were over, most of Casanova's ex-lovers still liked him, and he was reputedly quite the gentleman. This trope would probably fit (the fictional) Don Juan better.\n"}
{"FourSeasons": "In most media, either It's Always Spring whenever it isn't arctic winter, or else there will be four seasons \u2014 regardless of the climate the work is set in.\nThe \"standard\" seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn/Fall) may be employed as a device. Or a close-up on falling leaves, snow, flowers, etc. will be used as a seasonal Motif, to establish what time of the year it is; Compare Blade-of-Grass Cut. Or you can tie the plot to the seasons as if they were Elemental Powers of some sort.\nAlternatively, this will often be a Seasonal Montage, actively flipping between the seasons to show the passage of time in a story. Examples can be divided into the categories:\nThe opposite of It's Always Spring, Endless Winter and Forest of Perpetual Autumn, which describe situations where it's one season and always that season.\nCompare Temporal Theme Naming, Dreaming of a White Christmas, First Snow, Heat Wave, Indian Summer, Kigo, Four-Seasons Level.\n"}
{"ColorCodedStones": "This is a visual shorthand trope that makes gems identifiable on sight, often reducing gems to Palette Swaps of each other. In Real Life, there are many features that differentiate minerals, gemstones, precious metals, and organic gems from each other: hardness, smoothness, clarity, a range of possible colors, and location found. But the only feature the audience can directly see for themselves, and that most people outside of geologists are readily familiar with, is color. Therefore, gems in fiction will often be identified solely by color, with a standard set of gem-color associations dictating the types of gems. The gems may be identical aside from the differences in color.\nGenerally, the code is as follows:\nSee also the Birthstones in the Real Life section for more.\nOften these gemstones are seen together as a set of Mineral Macguffins. When it's more generalized (i.e. all red gems are rubies, all orange gems are topaz all the way down the rainbow), it's never brought up why there's so much mineral diversity in one area. If a gemstone is not the usual color, that is usually a plot relevant detail.\nIf there's gemstone Theme Naming going on, this trope functions in essentially the same way as Color-Coded for Your Convenience. \"Ruby\" is synonymous with \"Fancy Red\" and so on. This may also double as Fancy Color Coded Elements, such as having a Fire Ruby.\nA subtrope to Color-Coded for Your Convenience for gemstones. It can be related to One Steve Limit, Color-Coded Characters and Color-Coded Elements. A sister trope to All-Natural Gem Polish.\n"}
{"TheWebAlwaysExisted": "You travel back in time to The Middle Ages or 1 Million B.C., turn on your Time Machine's computer and... there's Google! Apparently the Web has always been there... humans just discovered how to access it in the early 1990s. This phenomenon results from filmmakers wanting to have their time-traveler show off the World Wide Boomstick without letting logic get in the way. However, anyone with a passing understanding of technology will realize that this implies the Web was always floating out there and that people just needed the right equipment to access it. (Which, we grant you, is a pretty nifty idea for a story gimmick, but this trope more often occurs because the writers just weren't paying attention.)\nAnother variation occurs if a time-traveler brings a TV or radio back in time and it plays current shows rather than the ones that existed back then. In fact, this trope refers to pretty much any instance where a technology that clearly relies on outside input to function is placed in a situation, usually through Time Travel, where that input could not possibly exist and it functions anyway.\nThis could technically happen in real life, assuming time travel is possible. However, it would require the machine's owner to not clear its history and all the files downloaded from the website in question. The computer obviously would not be able to get to anywhere on the Internet it had not stored. And of course it would require a source of electricity, if you go back far enough. Alternately, if communications between the two times are available, you could theoretically route the Internet through such a link - the computer in the past would call a computer in the present and ask for the page, and the computer in the present would deliver it back. The lag would probably suck, though.\nBut with the advent of really big hard drive spaces (A few terabytes would be sufficient to get a good portion of The Other Wiki, for starters), one could conceivably download big, giant portions of the internet that is relevant and bring it back through time for later access. Of course, you must be pretty darn crazy prepared if you actually do this in the first place.\n(Of course, the Doctor could make a cell phone call through time, so theoretically...)\nContrast Sudden Lack of Signal.\n"}
{"SexualHarassmentAndRapeTropes": "Rape is one of the more difficult subjects to handle in a work of fiction, not least because (unlike, say, a gruesome and violent murder) there is a higher chance that one of the work's readers has experienced this crime first-hand. For the most part, the tropes that have been collected here describe less sensitive and sometimes downright backwards depictions of rape or harassment.\nFor obvious reasons, many of these tropes are considered crossing the Moral Event Horizon. Though it's sometimes used as a cheap way to make the heroes look better in comparison even if they don't fit any definition of \"Hero\".\nContrast Flirting and Courtship (trying to get it on with someone properly).\n"}
{"TransNature": "A person is either part of a certain category (such as a certain species or gender) that they do not feel all right with, and so they want to be part of a different category, or the person was assigned a certain category (often against their will) that they never belonged to in the first place, or some combination of both. Because of this, the person may want or need to change their body or nature or both.\nIn fiction, Trans Nature can take any form, especially in fantasy and science fiction. Note that trying to regain your true form (after having been cursed, for example) does not count. Starting to identify with your new form does, however.\nWhen a character is a fictional kind of Trans Nature, it is often a big part of this character being a hero or villain: Either he's a member of an oppressive/evil group transitioning to become one of the good and/or oppressed people, or we have a \"traitor\" who identifies with the \"wrong\" group.\nIt can also work as an inversion of Internalized Categorism: Bob thinks men/humans are bad, but instead of denying himself the good things about being a man/human or doing bad things because he thinks that this is what being a \"real\" man/human means, he instead stops being a man/human \u2014 magically changing into something else.\nExpect the character to be in a world of trouble if there is No Transhumanism Allowed.\nMay be caused by Humanity Is Infectious, or inversions thereof. In some cases, Trans Nature leads to Humanity Ensues. Note, however, that that trope is usually not combined with Trans Nature \u2013 instead, the animal resents having been transformed to a human. One very common form of Trans Nature is Pinocchio Syndrome: a robot, living doll or whatever wanting to become a real human.\nSupertrope of Transgender and Pinocchio Syndrome. Sometimes a Sister Trope of Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence. Compare and contrast The Whitest Black Guy and Becoming the Mask.\n"}
{"DarkisEvil": "Darkness is associated with evil, ugliness, scary monsters, and super creeps. This is the reason for the naming of The Dark Side and why Evil Counterpart characters and certain Underground Monkeys often have 'dark' in front of their names. Like all Colour-Coded for Your Convenience/Good Colors, Evil Colors examples, this is common, but not universal, and will vary from culture to culture.\nThe logic behind the trope is as follows: most humans fear the dark, at least to some degree; our sight is the sense we depend on the most, and we cannot see well in darkness, therefore a lack of light makes us feel very vulnerable to danger.note\u00a0Leopards, one kind of predator our ancestors had to deal with on the African plains, prefer to hunt on moonless nights so that they can sneak up on their prey. Humans that weren't afraid of the dark probably became leopard chow. Furthermore, the fact that it's so hard to see in darkness (well, for humans, anyways) has caused some of us to associate darkness with deception. Evil is associated with deception as well, so, from Star Wars to cowboy movies, a lot of bad guys wear black hats. If you want to be even more obvious about it, give the bad guy a name that has something to do with darkness.\nIf a character has darkness-based powers, see Casting a Shadow.\nStories where Dark Is Evil and Light Is Not Good are commonplace to show that the light can be just as foul as darkness.\nWhy Evil Is Not Well-Lit, and why having the sun vanish is a bad sign. See also Light Is Good, Light/Darkness Juxtaposition, Bad Powers, Bad People, Obviously Evil, Darkness = Death, and Nice Day, Deadly Night.\nA Super Trope to Evil Wears Black. Black is the favorite color of the Card-Carrying Villain, as it is associated with the color of death in the western world. Vampires, witches and necromancers are also traditionally seen in black garb.\nDark Is Not Evil is the inversion and the good counterpart of this trope. Another one is The Sacred Darkness, where Dark may or may not be evil, but is just as important as Light.\n"}
{"ThreeRoundDeathmatch": "So, you've just finished laying the smackdown on your opponent with a devastating array of punches and kicks. The screen fades to black...\n\"Round Two, Fight!\" What's this? You and your opponent are standing across from each other again, and you're both at full health. That's right, this is a Three Round Deathmatch. Even though it rarely makes much sense, this has been part of Fighting Games for so long that it's long since become an acceptable break from reality.\nThe usual way to avert this in Fighting Games is through a \"team battle\" system, where victory isn't achieved through knocking someone out twice in a row, but simply by taking out everyone on the opposing side. On defeating a member of the opposing team, the winning character sometimes gains health back, as though they got a chance to rest between rounds.\nThis term pops up in Pro Wrestling, where \"deathmatch\" typically just means no disqualifications.\n"}
{"BohemianParody": "\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen is quite an Ear Worm. Pretty much everyone can recognize the distinctive and complex melody, most people know the lyrics (at least approximately), it's a melding of numerous musical genres from rock to opera (thus lending itself nicely to being played with using other genres as well), and it also has a rather famous and recognisable music video. As a result, thanks to its distinctive nature and Small Reference Pools, it's become quite a common subject for Parody.\nThere are several common approaches. The first is to keep the melody more or less intact but change the lyrics to suit a new, comic purpose. The second is to keep the song more or less the same, but have it sung by unlikely or inappropriate stand-ins for Queen (such as the crew of the U.S.S Enterprise) or in much sillier or inappropriate voices, and a third is to keep the lyrics the same but change the melody from a dramatic fusion of rock and opera that something a bit less... bombastic. Then, once you're done, all you need to do is replace the 'Bohemian' part of the title with something more appropriate to your current purposes so that the title becomes \"[X] Rhapsody\", and bingo! Instant hilarity!\nSince any of these options allow for endless fun to be had with the song, it's a popular target for fandom parodies. Of the different sections of the song to parody, popular ones include the 'ballad' section (\"Mama, just killed a man...\") and especially the 'opera' section (\"I see a little silhouetto of a man\" to \"Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me, for me!\").\nWhile the song is subject to numerous parodies, the music video for the song is itself quite well-recognised and thus also subject to frequent parodies and visual homage. The stock visual parody in this case is the instantly recognisable image of four people arranged in a 'diamond' formation against a dark background, with the lighting arranged to suggest that their heads are disembodied (an image frequently used through the video, taken from the cover of the band's second album).\n"}
{"TheGreatOffscreenWar": "There was a war. It happened years ago, maybe even thousands of years. Characters reference it, especially if they took a part in it: the Shell-Shocked Veteran never managed to get over what he experienced back then, while the Phony Veteran, on the other hand, will never shut up about how many brave things he did in it.\nSometimes people will use the war as a reference point for placing events on a timeline - something happened a few years before the war, or somebody did something after the war.\nMaybe people still have to deal with its consequences. The war happened, and it left its ugly mark on the world. But it's never shown to the audience - we never see a single flashback from the war, are never shown more than just a glimpse of what happened. The war will be referenced, but otherwise left mysterious, unexplained. Why it happened, how it ended, and what all the things that took place there (which people talk about like it should be obvious) actually were, are never explained. The war is only a mysterious event of the past, included mostly to add a bit of mystery and give people excuses for insane ideas. Needless to say, this trope can easily be processed into Fanfic Fuel.\nWorld War III is often used as this, as are the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and so on. Stories set After the End have the tendency to do this with the war that caused the apocalypse. If the war never stopped, may be a Forever War.\nOften used as a sub-trope of Cryptic Background Reference. Compare also Cataclysm Backstory, and Unspecified Apocalypse for After the End-type scenarios that were not necessarily caused by war. For a fight that literally happens just offscreen, see Battle Discretion Shot.\nPlease, avoid shows referencing Real Life conflicts. We already have plenty of information on them. If anything, such tales would go under During the War.\n"}
{"GiantNoveltyCheck": "A lot of money has changed hands in this transaction. However, unlike a Briefcase Full of Money, this is a very public affair, usually designed to generate a lot of attention. So how is this shown when the cameras are on? Why, with a giant novelty check, of course!\nUsually made out of cardboard or really thick, stiff paper, these checks are typically used either:\nThose aren't the only uses for them, just the two most common.\nIt's worth noting that there is no required size or format for checks, so giant novelty checks can indeed be cashed at most banks so long as they have all of the required bank info on them.

{"EverythingsMessierWithPigs": "There's one thing most people know about pigs: they are messy as hell. In times past, in some rural 3rd-world areas, pigs would even consume the waste from the outhouse.note\u00a0It was Fair for Its Day; it solved the problem of eliminating waste (similar to how in other places, the pigs were fed not bodily waste but garbage), and the pigs got food and shelter. This Animal Stereotype is so prominent, it lead to pigs being almost invariably portrayed as filthy dirt-lovers.\nActually, pigs are instinctively clean animals, but their habit of rooting the ground and rolling in whatever moisture is available creates messy results in confined spaces. Despite not having that much hair, pigs aren't able to sweat, meaning that they have to roll around in cool and damp places frequently to prevent themselves from suffering heatstroke. Also, thanks to their omnivorous instinct to probe and explore everything around them for traces of food, pigs love to make a mess by chewing things to bits and rooting around in the pieces. Rotten wood, sofa cushions, or especially straw are bound to wind up in a million tiny fragments when a pig can get at them. For a human observer, such behavior creates a strong impression of a messy, dirty, unhygienic animal.\nThere is also quite a common subversion of this trope: when the pig is obsessively clean, proper and hygienic, in a somewhat exaggerated way. Note that to count as a subversion, the pig shouldn't just be clean; tidiness should be one of the main defining traits of its personality.\nThere's also the so-called Babe Syndrome: the tendency of city folk who have never seen a live pig in the flesh to think that pigs are small and cute and pink and make good pets. While pigs are very intelligent and can be trained to do tricks and such, the average barnyard porker isn't particularly cuddly. They can also weigh up to a few hundred pounds and occasionally be quite aggressive. There are a few breeds bred specifically as pets, such as pot-bellied pigs, but even these require specialized care that most people cannot meet.\nFor non-porcine characters who are messy as pigs, see The Pig Pen. For another common pig-related trope, see Gluttonous Pig (and its Darker and Edgier subtrope, Fed to Pigs). For a trope related to boars, pigs' big and scary cousins, see Full-Boar Action.\n"}
{"DoomedHomeTown": "The town the hero first appears in is often his hometown. There is a very high chance said town will be demolished by evil forces, prompting him to go on his quest, although sometimes the town is inaccessible for other reasons (banishment, for example).\nThis is not strictly limited to hometowns. It's almost guaranteed that wherever the hero starts out \u2014 be it town, planet or even universe, depending on the scope of the story \u2014 is likely to be rudely destroyed by the forces of fate as soon as his back is turned.\nFrequently paired with Refusal of the Call, since The Call Knows Where You Live, and often the reason You Can't Go Home Again after Easing into the Adventure. Often results in the hero watching the town burn, emotionally overcome at having their source of joy destroyed. Rarely, the Final Boss may take place in the very same town.\nOne of the worst examples of this trope, reserved for the most heartless of villains, is for when they are eventually confronted for it by the hero, and they don't even remember doing it.\nNote that this trope does not include stories in which survival (within the town) during disaster or war, and its aftermath, are the main focus. The key aspect of this trope is not that the town is destroyed, but that the destruction of (or banishment from) the hero's old home becomes an impetus to the later adventures.\nSee also Where I Was Born and Razed, when the character is the doom of their own hometown.\nNot to be confused with Domed Hometown, although these are easier to doom. See also Sugar Apocalypse.\n"}
{"PaperTalisman": "These paper tags, also known as \"ofuda\", are used in Shinto and Onmy\u014dd\u014d for purification and exorcisms or as wards. They are sometimes used with Shide, and most commonly at Shinto Shrines or by Miko.\nTaoists also use a version of the tags called Fu. In Buddhism and Hinduism they are called Sutras. In Korean shamanism they are known as Pujok.\nThe western equivalent would be a conspicuously-placed rosary or crucifix, although it was common practice in the Middle Ages to use thin parchment prayer scrolls and wax seals in a similar fashion.\nIn Anime and Manga they can do anything, even explode. If in the form of a card, a Death Dealer may use these.\nCompare with Paper Master, a form of Functional Magic that uses paper.\n"}
{"ADayInTheLimeLight": "A secondary or Ensemble character gets the primary focus for an episode in an atypical fashion. This can be used to either give various cast members a rest, both for the actor and for the audience or to allow different episodes to be shot simultaneously to save on time or costs. It can also be used to explore the possibility of an expanded role for a recurring or secondary character, or to set up a Spin-Off. Fans of secondary characters may explore the idea of their favourite character becoming the primary protagonist in a FanFic.\nSometimes the limelight is given to a guest character of note, often a character so outrageous that he/she upstages the regulars, or a nobody with a touching, moving story. This is occasionally done in comedies where the focus is less on the regular characters usual antics and hijinks, and more on the guest character. In such cases, the regular characters may be temporarily demoted to Straight Man status. In some cases, the regular characters are just present either to provide moral support or to be the recipients of An Aesop. Such episodes may be of the Very Special Episode variety and may focus on a serious issue facing the guest character.\nWhile often times this trope only applies to secondary or background characters, in an ensemble cast with fairly equitable time sharing, any episode that shines the spotlight on one particular character can be considered a Limelight Episode even if that character is top billed.\nWhen these characters in this episode face a conflict, they may either resolve it themselves, or somebody else - frequently the actual protagonist - will.\nA number of tropes act as more specialized examples of this trope:\nSee Character Focus for the Super Trope, and if the minor mook gets a whole spinoff, that becomes Breakout Mook Character. Contrast with Day in the Life, A Death in the Limelight.\n"}
{"FiringDay": "Being fired is one of the most traumatic experiences a person can go through. Not only do they lose their livelihood, their circle of work friends, and their routine, but they have to deal with the fact that somebody looked them in the eye and said \"You're not good enough\". Or maybe even worse: Didn't look them in the eye, and just sent a dismissal letter or e-mail as though they weren't worth the personal appearance.\nBut it's not always easy on the person doing the firing, either. They need to be the one who looks the other person in the eye and says \"You're not good enough\", and then they need to live with the guilt afterwards. How do you just go back to your 9-to-5 job after you made the calculated decision that somebody wasn't worth keeping around?\nWhether you're the fire-er or the fire-ee, it's a serious event, with long lasting repercussions.\nStories that focus on the person being fired can approach it in multiple different ways. If the character knows its coming, they can play up the fear and dread as the deadline approaches. In a comedy this can be the impetus for a Zany Scheme to try and save their job, or perhaps a form of revenge against the company instead. If it is a surprise, it can serve as a Cruel Twist Ending to shock and dismay the audience. If the character is a main character in an ongoing story they will often have their job again the next week, but not always. Sometimes this leads to an entirely new story or arc. Occasionally the firing will be seen as a good thing, giving the character the impetus to pursue their dreams that they had been putting off.\nStories which focus on the person performing the firing don't have as much leeway, and instead have one predominant feature: Forcing the character to shoulder the responsibility of firing somebody. Normally this will be their very first firing, and will come after a recent promotion to highlight the burdens that come with the perks of management. It might also be somebody they were friends with, or had previously hired, to add emotional complexity. Normally they want desperately to be a Benevolent Boss, only to ultimately find that there is no way around the issue in the cut-and-dry world of dollars and cents.\nIf the person doing the firing is a supervillain or criminal of some kind, this might overlap with You Have Failed Me or You Have Outlived Your Usefulness. Related to Kicked Upstairs and Reassigned to Antarctica, where they try to get rid of somebody without firing them.\nKeep in mind that this is not just for any incident where a person is fired in a story, but is about the way stories explore the lead-up and aftereffects on the people involved. Not related to Out of Job, Into the Plot, which is when a person fired at the start of a work (Or even before it) leads to an unconnected main plot.\nComicbooks\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nProfessional Wrestling\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"TheRainMan": "The Rain Man has a Disability Superpower. Karmic law dictates that every mental birth defect has a compensating benefit. Like taking flaws on an RPG character, there is always an intelligence point payback, and usually a special skill, too. Some Rain Men are friendless creepy freaks, others are lovable weirdos. Rain Men are always equipped with supernatural skills.\nThese skills are usually mental and often geeky. At the low end are super keen observation, memory and calculation. At the high end are telekinesis and hacking into the world's computational substrate. In the namesake film, the skills are near-instantaneous observation and counting that makes Dustin Hoffman's character a nightmare for a decent casino.\nWould-be kidnappers and other baddies will think the Rain Man makes an easy target, on account of his not-intimidating frame. But these hidden skills will come to the fore in the hour of need.\nIn Real Life, autism is a complex brain development disorder associated with interaction/communication problems and restricted repetitious behavior. Extreme cases can be disabling, but the negative medical view of autism is highly controversial in some quarters. Autism is seen by many autistics (including some people with Asperger syndrome, or \"Aspies\") as more akin to a different viewpoint and way of life. Savant skills are rare, although repetitious behavior does tend to result in autistics acquiring some unusual skills through practice. But none of that makes good television, does it?\nOh, and savant skills aren't always associated with autism to begin with. The person \"Rain Man\" was based on, a savant named Kim Peek, was probably not autistic, but had FG syndrome, an X-linked genetic disorder that causes serious physical and mental abnormalities in the affected.\nSee also Science-Related Memetic Disorder, for a truly exaggerated take on the subject; Absent-Minded Professor and TV Genius, for somewhat milder takes; Crazy Awesome, for when their effectiveness depends on their abnormal behaviour; Genius Ditz when the disability is just plain stupidity, and Neurodiversity Is Supernatural for if the character's \"gift\" is a superpower. Can overlap with High-Functioning Autism.\nA subtrope of Idiot Savant.\nIf you are looking for the film called Rain Man, it is here.\n"}

{"OrphanedPunchLine": "When characters are seen telling jokes to one another, we rarely get to hear the entire joke: usually we will just hear the setup or the punchline. Punchlines are often more common, as it allows us to cut to the end and see other people's reaction to the joke, whether it be rip-roaring hilarity, monocle-popping disgust or a deathly quiet.\nAn advantage of this over actually telling the joke is that the writer's sense of humor may not match with the viewers, leading to a different reading of the joke, when it's easier to just suggest it. It also functions as a form of Getting Crap Past the Radar, hinting at filth in works that would never allow it. The punchlines or setups are often from actual jokes (usually dirty or obscure ones), so there are several stock punchlines you hear; \"The Aristocrats\" is a popular one. Alternatively they're intended to be as weird as possible, leaving the audience wondering what the setup/punchline could possibly be \u2014 in most of these cases, the setup/punchline never existed in the first place.\nAnother alternative is a dirty Limerick which is cut off before the end. People from Nantucket are common, as well as something akin to:\nSee also Orphaned Setup, Subverted Punchline, Late to the Punchline, Lost in Transmission, Noodle Implements, Faux Final Line and Forgotten Trope.\n"}
{"Seinen": "Seinen (Japanese for \"young man\" or \"young men\", and pronounced [\u02c8se\u026a \u02ccnen], not [\u02c8sa\u026a \u02ccnen]) is a demographic designation of Anime and Manga targeted at male audiences aged 18 to 40. It is the older counterpart of Sh\u014dnen and effectively makes for the majority of anime in the older demographic, since major Josei manga titles are rarely made into anime. Compared to shonen, seinen caters to a much smaller viewing crowd, since younger audiences have much more time to spare on anime, which makes them a more attractive target, and thus is slightly less known.note\u00a0Ironically, in America this is considered a very lucrative demographic, but with the country's aging population, it means that there just aren't as many people in this demographic to advertise to.\nThanks to the older target audience, seinen shows tend to be much more sophisticated and mature than their shonen counterparts. Much more attention is paid to the plot and the interaction between characters than to action and fightsnote\u00a0That doesn't mean seinen series don't have excellent action scenes though, many of them have extremely detailed and excellently drawn action scenes., which are the main attraction for most viewers, and the characters are well fleshed out. The latter trait often leads to confusion of seinen with Shoujo but the key difference is that seinen does not idealize romance, instead opting for a more realistic and pragmatic approach to relationships. Realism is indeed the calling card of seinen shows, commonly earning them the acclaim for their depth and maturity and Multiple Demographic Appeal.\nA typical seinen protagonist can be of any gender and age (in stark contrast to shonen, whose protagonists are almost exclusively young and male), but tend to be young adults (like its target audience). Romance-wise, anything goes, from Romantic Two-Girl Friendship to obscure examples of Boys' Love. In fact, Schoolgirl Lesbians are a distinctive trait of seinen, rarely if ever present in shonen shows. Relationships are portrayed in a less idealistic light than in shojo, with many grays and uncertainties like in Real Life, and don't tend to indulge the shonen over-simplification of \"which heroine will be hooked up with the hero\". There is a reverse side to this, too: ironically, seinen is most infamous for its sub-category of Improbably Female Cast and Harem Series that rely heavily on cutesy Moe Fanservice (again, juxtaposed to plain sex appeal of female characters in shonen) to attract viewers. These series tend to be on the opposite side of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism from the grim type of seinen, instead being fluffy, heart-warming, and comedic.\nRecently, there has been a considerable influx of shojo fans into the seinen demographic, thanks to the latter's traditional thoroughness in relationships and, more importantly, general retraction from blatant fanservice. This migration was particularly paved by such Gateway Series as  Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, Kanon, CLANNAD, and AIR due to its presence of female leads. There is also a small influx of shonen fans as well, thanks to the incorporation of dark seinen themes in many of the shonen works (such as Attack on Titan, Death Note, and Deadman Wonderland). A lot of anime series not aimed at kids are de facto seinen, even if their source material is originally shojo or shonen manga, as evidenced by the late time slots these shows get. The demographic divisions are much less distinct with TV anime than they are with manga, perhaps out of acknowledgement of the overlap that the shonen, seinen and shojo demographics already share. This is also analogous to the tankobon volumes of manga that originally appeared in shonen magazines being marketed to the seinen crowd. This is even more pronounced when these works are exported. A lot of shonen series are marketed to older audiences overseas, as much of the content just wouldn't fly with younger Western audiences, which only muddies the waters even further.\nSome of the anime stuff shown on [adult swim] and the revived Toonami is seinen, EXCLUDING the likes of InuYasha, Bleach, Soul Eater, s-CRY-ed, Naruto, IGPX Immortal Grand Prix, Detective Conan, Durarara!!, Samurai 7, Trinity Blood, Eureka Seven, One Piece, Fullmetal Alchemist, Death Note, Michiko & Hatchin, Kekkaishi, Deadman Wonderland and (taking only the anime as reference) Neon Genesis Evangelionnote\u00a0Yes, really. which are shonen (except Michiko & Hatchin and Trinity Blood, which are josei and shojo respectfully), but have very Seinen type themes.\nCompare the Distaff Counterpart Josei, which is aimed at females of the same age.\n"}
{"SheCleansupNicely": "A character who has been presented to the audience as not particularly attractive cleans up, puts on nice clothes (or fancy clothes) and is suddenly stunningly attractive.\nIf it's a female, she may originally be dowdy, unfashionable, a Tomboy or Wrench Wench, or simply not particularly attentive to her appearance. If it's a male character, he may be slovenly or sloppy. Either gender may be impoverished and therefore shabby in their normal appearance.\nFor non-native English speakers (or anyone who's confused), the trope name refers to the subject cleaning herself nicely \u2014 all prettied up for admiration.\nEvery adaptation of \"Cinderella\" ever has this moment as the abused scullery maid arrives at the ball with her Fairy Godmother powered ballgown. Possibly the Trope Maker.\nWrench Wenches are likely to have at least one scene like this. Tomboys and The Lad-ette also often have a moment like this \u2014 often tagged with a \"Hey, I guess you really are a girl.\" This happens to the Undercover Model for work-related reasons.\n(The trope overlaps with Beautiful All Along if it requires a permanent change in her attitude, but is more distinct if it only needs clothes, grooming and opportunity. A common sign of this trope being separate is if she (or he) goes back to the old look and the Love Interest doesn't mind at all.)\nSister Trope to Beautiful All Along, Princess for a Day, Hollywood Homely and Bathe Her and Bring Her to Me. Occasionally involves a Pimped-Out Dress, but regular clothing will do. May be part of a Rags to Royalty situation. Sometimes overlaps with She Is All Grown Up. Contrast Unkempt Beauty, where she doesn't need to be cleaned up to look nice. Be aware of the Unnecessary Makeover where this trope doesn't work. See Tarnishing Their Own Beauty for the deliberate inversion.\n"}
{"QuantityvsQuality": "In fiction, when it comes to almost everything that comes in multiples, there's an inverse relationship between quantity and quality. The more there is of something, the lower the quality of those individual things and vice versa.\nThis has roots in basic resource management and production. Assuming you have a constant supply of resources, the more resources you put into producing a product, the higher-quality the product will be in the end. However, as a drawback, the less of the product you will able to produce. You could choose to put less resources into producing individual products in order to produce more, but the quality of the products decrease. Trying to make more of a product and make them high-quality is generally impractical due to resource and time constraints.\nAt times quantity and quality are used as the basis for An Aesop. Most aesops take the side of quality, saying that it's best to put effort into the individual creations.\nIn Real Life, however, unless there is a sizable technological difference, quantity will usually win out.\nSides with Quality\nSubtrope of Necessary Drawback.\n"}
{"CupidHatesOddCouples": "When two friends or siblings fall in love with the same person, one of two things will happen.\nIf the show is an After School Special or comedy, the friends will fight for a bit and then realize that what they are doing is stupid because \"friendship is more important than some guy/girl\". The guy/girl turning out to be a Handsome Lech or The Vamp is what usually makes the friends realize this.\nIf the show is aimed at an older audience, this Love Triangle will break when one steps aside and allows the other to have a chance at love. This preserves their friendship.\n"}
{"NonHumanHead": "A being, almost always a humanoid with at least human intelligence, with an inanimate object (or, more rarely, an animal) in place of a head. Depictions of these types of creatures go back at least to Egyptian Mythology, where many deities were depicted with animal heads and human bodies to show their divine natures.\nThese days, they sometimes appear in Urban Fantasy stories, either as 'living technology' or as explicitly magical beings; for some reason, electronics are particularly popular choices for these characters. What exactly they are varies by depiction- they can be human in all but appearance, Mechanical Lifeforms built for specific functions, Anthropomorphic Personifications who outright embody what they're shown as having for heads, or simply as odd but normal people in a Fantasy Kitchen Sink.\nThey're often shown with their heads floating above their shoulders rather than having necks, in order to save the artist from trying to make the join between a human body and non-human head seem natural; having non-human characteristics other than their heads (odd skin colors or materials, powers thematically relating to their heads, etc.) is also common. They're also always able to talk without the use of a mouth.\nSubtropes include Surreal Symbolic Heads, where they appear specifically to be odd and weird out the viewer (the Uncanny Valley nature of a human body without a human head is often played up with that trope) and Pumpkin Person, who is specifically a person with a pumpkin for a head.\nCompare The Blank for other types of creatures that lack facial features, and Petting Zoo Person, a character which looks like someone slapped animal features on an otherwise human body. Beast with a Human Face is the inverse, where it's a non-human body with a human head. Sometimes the subjects of Animorphism fall into this trope, if their transformation is only of their head; Skull for a Head can also sometimes overlap if the skull is not of the being's species.\n"}
{"WarringNatures": "A character is a Half-Human Hybrid ('Human' being used loosely,) but the parent races of the two 'halves' are at war, or generally don't get along well. This can present a problem depending on how much the character looks like either one. If he looks nothing like one, he may be able to fit into the other group with ease. If he looks like a mixture of both, however, he likely won't be able to fit in with either group. At best, he'll be teased or shunned for it, possibly becoming an 'evil' loner. At worst, he'll be exiled or possibly even killed. This could even be the villain's Start of Darkness, if he's hated by both sides enough to plot the eradication of both.\nIf the two parent races are actually at war, the character will eventually be forced to choose a side to fight for. Depending on what they are, the choice may simply be between good and evil. Other times it may come down to 'the ones that shunned me' vs 'those that accepted me'. Occasionally, the decision is a difficult one, especially if they have friends from both sides. Depending on the cause of the mix, the character may be actively trying to become one side or the other, using the local Phlebotinum.\nRelated to Hunter of His Own Kind, for most hybrid characters. See also Half-Breed Discrimination. Depending on the situation, a Monsters Anonymous group may help reconcile or control the warring natures.\nFor a character whose conflict is internal, rather than between parent species, you may be looking for The Corruption, Enemy Within, Fighting from the Inside, or occasionally Viral Transformation. The character probably has Heroic Willpower. May be a Child of Forbidden Love.\n"}
{"MixAndMatchCreature": "A common way of making monsters or fantastic creatures is to simply take existing animals and combine their parts. For instance, the Chimera (lion head, goat body, snake tail) or the Minotaur (bull head, human body). Also common is to simply take an existing animal and vary it a simple way \u2014 Pegasus is a horse but with wings, hippocampi have the heads and front bodies of horses but the tails of fish, etc.\nCompare Fusion Dance and Two Beings, One Body, which is when two characters are combined. Shapeshifter Mashup usually results in this. Mix-and-Match Critters may be the result of Hot Skitty-on-Wailord Action. If both creatures are already mythological/magical/whatever and get mixed, they have a newborn Hybrid Monster and if mundane they can end up with a Patchwork Kid. Application of the principle to humans may count as Bio-Augmentation, see also Mix-and-Match Man.\n"}

A favorite weapon of the bookworm might even be what's always close at hand.\nElderly examples are often Old Masters who have spent decades contemplating philosophy and punching trees in half. Another common type is the Adventurer Archaeologist, who spends as much time studying in the University as that type does evading the poison-tipped arrows of angry natives. If the bookworms are a bit ditzy, expect them to be Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass. If they prefer not to fight, doing so only when they must, then they have Minored in Ass-Kicking. They are very likely to wear Specs of Awesome. In a Five-Man Band specializing in Brains, a Badass Bookworm might as well be The Big Guy.\nThe trope is the converse of Genius Bruiser. A Badass Bookworm looks like your standard geek, but then displays a surprising amount of physical prowess, whereas a Genius Bruiser looks big, strong and tough, then unexpectedly shows off an intellectual side.\nNote this is a different trope from the typical Secret Identity superhero like early Peter Spider-Man Parker, as no one suspects the nerd to be the superhero. Overlaps with Dork Knight.\n"}
{"MasterOfAll": "What if you could be, not merely average, but world-class... at EVERYTHING?\nThe strength of a Mighty Glacier, without the slowness. The speed of a Fragile Speedster, without the fragility. The mojo of a Squishy Wizard without the squish. The stopping power of a Glass Cannon but Made of Diamond.\nMaster of None, Jack-of-All-Stats / Trades are related tropes. Each describes a generalist character type, bad/good/great at everything. While the Jack might be good enough at any skill, the Master of All is rarely outclassed, usually only by someone with a Crippling Overspecialization. Compare Lightning Bruiser.\n"}
{"WoobieDestroyerofWorlds": "This is a character with omnicidal and/or Ax-Crazy tendencies, or well, a character who wants to destroy everyone in the story, and is suddenly in a position to do so (on a small or large scale); but in contrast to other characters, he/she has some plausible, outright tragic reason to do so. In some cases, the other characters outright sympathize with this one (whether or not the audience does too is out of the equation here), all the while accepting that they must be stopped. Sometimes, the character is even portrayed as likeable, just... not with the right mindset.\nThe essential element is that the destroyer has been pushed beyond all reason. This may or may not make them The Woobie, but either way they are portrayed as having a crappy existence. This is a character who, by definition, is constantly beaten up, kicked around, and lives an all-around miserable life. Should they lose everything and everyone they trust (be it through betrayal or in other cruel ways), and then just so happen upon the instrument of revenge against the cruel, heartless world that brought them so much pain, one need not be a genius to figure out whom the character will cast their hateful gaze upon. Think of this person as a Jerkass Woobie, only with the jerkassery replaced by insanity (though many characters do fulfill both tropes).\nThis trope is less about the Sliding Scale of Villain Threat and more about how much a character has been broken \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally \u2014 before they finally snap and blame the whole world for all the crap they have been through. Of course, they must crack and pose a sudden threat of some sort, to the characters and/or the setting. And some of them do get their finger on the nuke trigger. In a few extreme cases, they themselves are the nuke.\nA character who is a Woobie Destroyer of Worlds can be very high up on the Sliding Scale of Villain Threat and/or Sliding Scale of Villain Effectiveness while being very low on the Sliding Scale of Antagonist Vileness. Rather than hatred, the audience feels pity for this villain and wants to see them stopped nonviolently so they don't cause any more destruction or loss of life (or actively cheers them on, especially if their victims deserved it and were responsible for their suffering). If the Woobie Destroyer of Worlds has to be killed to stop his destruction spree, it makes for prime Alas, Poor Villain material especially if he regains his sanity as he's dying.\nNot to be confused with Mike Nelson, Destroyer of Worlds, where a bumbling but otherwise nice person accidentally destroys actual worlds, leading to What the Hell, Hero? and Nice Job Breaking It, Hero! moments.\nThis trope is more closely related to Break the Cutie, Freudian Excuse, Bullying a Dragon, Who's Laughing Now?, and Then Let Me Be Evil. May have emerged as a deconstruction of the Cosmic Plaything.\nNot the same as Put Them All Out of My Misery, which is the trope for characters who rationalize their destructive behavior by insisting that society, or the earth, must be somehow cleansed or punished for some past injustice, making it the inverse of this trope. Motive Rant, Cry for the Devil, and Villain Has a Point are more typical of that trope. For characters, especially villains somewhere in between this trope and that one, see Jerkass Woobie. Also note that overlaps between the two tropes are not impossible.\nMay overlap with Death Seeker, if they want to die, but intend to make sure that everyone else goes first. Likely to be a Draco in Leather Pants for some of the audience. Compare Sympathetic Sentient Weapon when they're in employ of someone/some group rather than acting on their own.\nAnd just to be clear, a character does not have to literally destroy worlds to fit this trope.\nFor actual world-destroying tropes, see Why You Should Destroy the Planet Earth.\nThere are several unmarked spoilers ahead! You have been warned.\n"}
{"Edutainment": "As the trope's title implies, the Edutainment Show combines educational content with entertainment. As such, most shows in this genre are aimed at children; of course, some more mature fare may fit this definition, such as MythBusters. Cooking Shows, Science Shows, Nature Shows, and other TV Documentary formats (especially Docudrama programs) may also count, if they are entertaining enough. Additionally, the definition has become somewhat blurred - these days networks often pass children's programs in particular as \"edutainment,\" when their only actual educational content is pro-social themes, such as \"work together as a team\", \"Reading Is Cool\", or \"be a good friend to others.\"\nMany Edutainment Shows appear on PBS, the most famous example being Sesame Street. Nickelodeon also has had quite a few in their \"Nick Jr.\" block, such as Blue's Clues and Dora the Explorer, as do specialized fact-oriented cable networks as The Learning Channel, the many Discovery channels, the History Channel, and Animal Planet. At least until Network Decay sets in.\nIn the United States, since 1990, networks are required to air at least 3 hours of educational material a week; the tag \"E/I\" (for \"Educational/Informative\") was created to denote such shows (though in the case of stations carrying Saved by the Bell, the rules are susceptible to Loophole Abuse if An Aesop is fit into the show in just the right way, and they can count as E/I). Now you know what the And Knowing Is Half the Battle is referring to.\nReligious Edutainment is a subgenre designed to teach and promote the values of a certain faith. For the Video Game counterpart, see Edutainment Game. See also Propaganda Piece.\n"}
{"HufflePuffHouse": "Some settings are richly designed and have a wealth of World Building, with a complex social and political system where The Federation and The Empire compete for power. To spice things up, various \"third side\" factions will be included to give the people in the wardrobe department something to do. You can't have them be too powerful, though, or too relevant, lest they get in the heroes' or villains' limelight.\nThis is Hufflepuff House, an organizational equivalent to the Mauve Shirt or Redshirt Army. They help round out the setting without actually impacting much on it, filling out the empty seats in The Alliance HQ and making things look diverse. At best, they might perhaps be The Cavalry. Hufflepuff House is often part of the backstory of a new character for an episode, and if the character becomes popular enough their House will become patterned after them. Oftentimes, this happens because the author was never able to implement a way to explore this faction in particular - after all, when most of the conflict comes from the actions of The Federation and The Empire upon each other, some people will choose to remain neutral or not get involved.\nNamed for the group in Harry Potter. Subtrope of Cryptic Background Reference. When a background character/group actually does have impact in the foreground, they are a Hero of Another Story.\n"}
{"ManaBurn": "An attack or ability that damages the Mana Meter of the victim. Other secondary effects may come in to play, but this is the ability's primary purpose.\nA fighter-type character capable of this trope and capable of spamming it in a very short time will be able to remove a Squishy Wizard anytime. This makes it a favored ability of the Mage Killer.\nSee also Mana Drain and Mana Shield.\n"}
{"SwiperNoSwiping": "The villain is merely told to stop his Evil Plan, and he does. Usually, this is a way to teach the audience a lesson about the importance of communication, and sometimes it stands as a testament to the hero's badassery, but just as often it's Played for Laughs due to the sheer unlikelihood of the idea.\nIt's the moment of truth. The villain, cackling, stands before his Doomsday Device. His finger hovers unsteadily over the Big Red Button, and you know he's enough of an asshole to push it. All hope seems lost... but then, the hero kicks open the double doors and bursts into the room. He looks at the villain straight in the eye, points his index finger at him, and says:\n\"Stop it! Stop it! What you are doing is wrong!!\"\nThe villain concedes. He powers down the machine and turns himself in. Battle over. Everyone lives Happily Ever After. If done well, it may establish the speaker as someone with greater authority than other characters (e.g., a parent, teacher, police officer), or that there are hidden factors only the character can indicate to makes the villain quit, or simply that the villain still has enough of a conscience to be shamed into doing the right thing. However, if handled poorly (which is usually the case) the viewer may left thinking, \"Worst! Anti-Climax! Ever!\"\nCompare Talking the Monster to Death, where the hero has to put some more significant, speechifying effort into breaking through the villain's personal Jerk Justifications, Shaming the Mob where it is done to a large group, and Verbal Judo where words are used to calm a conflict that wasn't necessarily going to get physical anyway. Contrast Unhand Them, Villain! where the villain obeys the hero's Exact Words in a way not intended.\n"}
{"DiscountLesbians": "They look exactly like hot women, and they make out with other hot women. But they're actually aliens/immortals/bodysnatchers/etc. So it's not really gay, right?\nDiscount Lesbians (or Discount Gays, or Discount Bisexuals, etc.) are canon homosexual characters and couples who are either not human to begin with, come from alternate realities, have been magically or technologically altered in ways that affect their sexuality, etc., so that they don't really \"count\". This usually seems to be a device used within the story to maintain a status quo that lets the (presumed) audience watch two hot chicks making out without having to think about the associated real-world issues of homosexuality. On the other hand, the trope may come into play if the writer wishes to include a lesbian relationship in the story but is worried about Moral Guardians, thus becoming a way for a Rule-Abiding Rebel to make an attempt at Getting Crap Past the Radar.\nNote that they're Discount Lesbians only if they're included in the story in a way that obviates the need to address the associated issues of sexuality. This is usually done through othering homosexuality by associating it only with characters who have conspicuously different traits from the viewers. Characters used to draw attention to those issues are inversions, although this can still fall into Fantastic Aesop or Space Whale Aesop. If they're stated to be homosexual they're not Discount Lesbians, just a non-human who happens to be gay.\nBasically gays... but cheaper. Commonly carries Unfortunate Implications (see page quote). It can be considered a subtrope of But Not Too Gay.\nCompare Have You Tried Not Being a Monster?, Lesbian Vampire, Bury Your Gays, and (occasionally) Elfeminate. Related to Deceptively Human Robots because both are only as robotic/gay, respectively, as is convenient for the show. Also see Space Jews for aliens standing in for minorities. Related to Hide Your Lesbians in that both are a way of including apparently gay content without admitting to it. See also Speculative Fiction LGBT, which is about how Speculative Fiction settings make showing LGBT acceptable. Not to be confused with transgender and metaphorically transgender characters.\n"}
{"OnlyFleshIsSafe": "This trope describes a weapon, superpower or some kind of phenomenon that explicitly damages/affects inanimate objects but has absolutely no effect on living organic matter. It of course does not stop the user from indirectly hurting someone by say, dropping a building on their foe, taking out the floor beneath their feet or blowing up the power source of their powered armor. For instance.\nCan be considered a Super Trope of The Nudifier but includes all the less prurient examples. Contrast with Neutron Bomb (which destroys organic matter only), As Lethal as It Needs to Be and Could Have Been Messy (both of which are extradiegetically brought on by poor editing and age restrictions respectively.) Contrast with Biomancy which is its precise polar opposite.\nFrom a Doylist point of view, its often a means of avoiding having a Story-Breaker Power or squick.\n"}
{"FakeFirstKiss": "These two characters are not an Official Couple, but they're clearly headed in that direction. The question is when. Their Will They or Won't They? relationship has spanned three seasons, their Unresolved Sexual Tension is impossible to ignore, and you're just waiting for a Love Epiphany.\nAnd then they kiss. This is a Game Changer, right? It has to be. Their entire relationship up to this point has revolved ignoring their obvious feelings for each other, and now that they've kissed, they can't ignore them anymore.\nExcept that they can.\nShows that rely on the Ship Tease between their two lead characters have to keep fans interested somehow. The relationship between these two characters has to continue to progress or fans will get bored, but the characters can't get together too soon, lest the show suffer Shipping Bed Death. These shows often rely on gimmicks that get fans excited and offer an illusion of progress while actually changing nothing, throwing people a bone to chew on while they sit through another two or three seasons of Belligerent Sexual Tension. Thus, the fake first kiss.\nIt was New Years. They were undercover. Someone lost a bet. It happened Under the Mistletoe. It was in a dream sequence or an alternate timeline. Maybe they thought they were about to die and they just needed to feel the soft press of someone else's lips against theirs one last time. The reasons are endless. The important thing is that there is a convenient reason for the characters to justify the kiss as the result of something other than their feelings for each other and never bring it up again. If the kiss significantly alters the relationship between the characters in some way, this trope does not apply. The Reset Button is key here.\nThis trope usually happens between the male and female lead of a TV show. The characters should have a long and dramatic would-be-romantic relationship. It usually occurs in a season finale, mid-season finale, or Wham Episode, like a real get-together would, but unlike an actual get-together, it may have been promoted ahead of time to draw an audience.\nWhile there may be older examples of this trope, it didn't become common until the early 2000s, after shows like The X-Files and Friends popularized drawn-out Will They or Won't They?-style Romance Arcs between series leads.\nSee Also: Ship Tease, Subtext, Fanservice, Will They or Won't They?, Fake-Out Make-Out, Accidental Kiss, Alternate Reality Episode, Platonic Kissing, Fever Dream Episode. Contrast: Moment Killer, Ship Sinking.\n"}
{"BadEnding": "(\"Good Ending\" redirects here. If you were looking for the manga series commonly known by that name, you'll find it under GE - Good Ending.)\nMultiple Endings are the most commonly seen form of Story Branching in video games, used primarily to increase their Replay Value, especially visual novels, role playing games, Survival Horror, dating sims, and fighting games. Different strategies or levels of skill in play will result in different endings, rather than all leading to a single predetermined conclusion. Generally, multiple playthroughs are necessary to see all the content, and possibly to unravel certain mysteries. What determines the ending usually involves the path one takes through the game (which can be as simple as choices the game gives in the prompt or as complex as entire alternate levels), whether one completes the 100% Completion, how well one plays the game (generally, scoring high is good and using continues is bad), other characters' Relationship Values towards you (including the Alliance Meter), and/or how high the player got the Karma Meter. Sometimes there are dual-optimal endings depending on which side the player chose to be on. (These can include the Forces of Evil!) The most diverse examples are found in Visual Novels and Dating Sims, including but not limited to:\nSome designers include truly \"neutral\" multiple ends, letting the player decide whether they're good or bad.\nThe major problem with Multiple Endings is that the sequel, should the developers decide to make one, obviously has to pick only one ending from which to continue the story \u2014 probably one of the good ones. This invariably occurs in adaptations to other media, such as novels, comics and television. Video games have the technical means to solve said problem with an Old Save Bonus, wherein the previous game's conclusion becomes the player's personal canon in the sequel. The other problem is that thanks to YouTube uploads, being able to view multiple endings no longer requires you to replay an entire game (perhaps in response to this, many games now have in-game rewards for getting different endings). Sometimes multiple endings require the player to do different actions or align themselves to different sides in order to see each ending, even if it means going against the main character's nature and goals to achieve it. This can make the story and characters look disjointed and confuse the player when they see the main character suddenly switching sides because of a few actions they did in a previous scene. When done poorly, having multiple endings can cause the player to have more questions than feel like the story is really resolved.\nOccasionally, the Multiple Endings are also couched with a non-linear plot \u2014 in which case, it can become frustrating-verging-on-impossible to find any of the multiple endings, especially if there are multiple \"threads\" in the plot.\nMultiple Endings are an effective way to avert Unstable Equilibrium. Instead of rewarding highly-skilled players with more power, reward them with less power, but give them a better ending if they can succeed. The opposite of Multiple Game Openings.\nContrast with Morton's Fork. Compare & contrast Multiple-Choice Future and Multiple-Choice Past.\nAs with all Ending Tropes, beware of spoilers.\n"}
{"Deathworld": "A Death World is a highly dangerous place, where simply going there is considered taking your life into your own hands. It could be from hazardous environmental conditions, such as an acidic swamp or poisonous fog, or from powerful native predators (Here there be Dragons, or worse, something that eats them), dangerous flora, or even all of the above. It's like the entire place is deliberately hostile to human life. (Of course, if it's also a Genius Loci, it just might be!)\nVery few people would ever choose to live there, but since anyone who does is almost always a badass, expect any populated Death World to be a World of Badass by default. Sometimes, The Mentor may hide out here. Alternately, it may be Mordor, and/or home for an exceptionally tough and ferocious race. Some actually take advantage of this as a way of training their Super Soldiers on a planetary scale. Sure, half of the population might not survive through adolescence, but those who do should make good soldiers. Sometimes they are genetically engineered. Those who live on such a world may be an example of Had To Be Sharp.\nIn real life, every planet outside Earth that we know of to a reasonable degree, is dangerous, because we have yet to verify that any other planet out there can support human life.\nIn fiction, Death worlds generally have relatively breathable atmospheres (for native life, at least), have compelling reasons for characters to get out and walk around, and have varieties of dangerous flora and fauna. A planet that cannot host life for any amount of time is just \"uninhabitable\", not this.\nFor more details, the various Video Game Settings actually do a decent job of describing the various kinds of dangers you might find in different ecosystems, as a result of Everything Trying to Kill You. The Dark World is often a magical variant. Don't be too surprised if there are More Predators Than Prey.\nThe Trope Namer is Harry Harrison's novel from 1960, Deathworld, in which the entire flora and fauna of a planet treat the human colonizers as enemies and do their best to kill them.\nCompare to Gaia's Vengeance where a world can become like this as a response to some threat. For examples of entire Death Universes, see Crapsack World.\nTruth in Television: There are plenty of environments here on our own planet that can and will kill those who fail to prepare for them or take the appropriate precautions around their hazards. Even the most fantastic fictional examples are often extrapolations of dangers present here on Earth \u2014 and that's before we get into the fact that we still haven't found any worlds outside our own that are particularly inviting for human life.\nNot to be confused with a Place Worse Than Death, which refers to Real Life locations with bad publicity.\n"}
{"RoadTrip": "Did you mean...\n"}
{"RandomEffectSpell": "Sometimes, even heroes like to live on the edge.\nA Random Effect Spell is just that\u2014a spell or item in a video game that pulls from a pool of random effects, instead of doing the same thing every time. Often (but not always) granted as a late-game spell or ability, or difficult to come by, the Random Effect Spell's effects can run the gauntlet from \"really cool\" to \"really lame\". How big the effect pool is can depend on the item or spell, though frequently, at least one or two of them will be a duplicate of an already-existing spell or ability (if not all of them). Frequently, at least one possible effect of the spell will be completely amazing (such as dealing massive damage to all enemies), but another will be completely horrible (such as cutting all your characters' health in half). Also frequent is one option which does absolutely nothing. Whether the risk is worth it generally depends on the ratio of good effects to bad ones in the pool, the cost of the ability, and how many (and how strong) the enemies are you face. Of course if you are playing on an emulator or Save Scumming is otherwise available, you can just keep resetting until you get the right luck.\nDue to its random nature, it is frequently Awesome, but Impractical and a Useless Useful Spell, but not always. If there are enough good effects, they can easily be a Lethal Joke Item or spell. If the randomness results from the spell being miscast, then that's Magic Misfire. Compare Randomized Damage Attack where it's only the damage that is random, but the effect stays the same - although they may overlap if one effect yield greater damage than the other.\nTroper General's Note: Many spells or items in video games (and other games) have an element of randomness to them to keep things unpredictable\u2014such as the additional damage from one spell being randomized, or one spell possibly being able to bestow a number of Standard Status Effects. However, for the purposes of this trope, we are primarily concerned about examples whose primary purpose or effect is the randomness.\nSee also the Super Trope Unpredictable Results.\n"}
{"DontShootTheMessage": "You partake in a piece of media. Frankly, you find it to be just terrible. The acting is wooden, the plot is boring and unrealistic, the effects are cheap, the soundtrack is annoying, and the costumes are ugly.\nWorse yet is the Aesop the show attempts to give: The logic of its arguments is faulty, if not nonsensical, its world-view is unnuanced, the characters frequently burst into boring monologues concerning what are almost certainly the author's opinions on the subject, those who disagree with the opinion are dismissed unsatisfactorily, and the general preachiness makes it a chore to get through.\nAnd the worst part of all of this? You actually agree with what the work is trying to say.\nRelated to the concept of the Clueless Aesop, Don't Shoot the Message is the phenomenon that results when viewers feel the need to explain that, while they are in agreement with the message attempted by a work, they hate the delivery enough that they still find the work intolerable. Quite often, this is because they consider the message's delivery to be about as subtle as an anvil to the face in a way that drags the whole work down. They might consider the messenger to be Right for the Wrong Reasons, or the message to be too oversimplified or laden with straw. The work is seen as preachy, even to people who agree with the message. The above description gives an extreme hypothetical, but you do not need to think a work is So Bad, It's Horrible to qualify; you merely have to dislike it for any of a hundred reasons unrelated to its Aesop.\nSuch a position should not be seen as particularly incongruous, but it is often assumed that those who dislike a work necessarily disagree with its point of view. Many times, it is indeed the case: If an unpalatable bias is detected in a work, people will steer clear of it. However, the a priori assumption that this is the case is most certainly an invocation of Logical Fallacies \u2014 for instance, hating a corny anti-drug PSA does not mean that one is a heroin addict.\nThe lines have been further blurred with the rise of entertainment specifically designed to appeal to various spots on political and social spectra, and not others. Style mixes with substance to such an extent that a rejection of one is seen as a rejection of the other. To take several broad examples: Certainly there are conservatives who dislike Ann Coulter or Glenn Beck, and liberals who dislike Michael Moore or Keith Olbermann. There are fundamentalist Christians who can't stand the Left Behind series or Chick Tracts, and atheists who don't like having Sam Harris or Bill Maher as spokesmen. There is, of course, nothing objectively wrong with liking any of these things (yes... even that one). However, the fact remains that those that like the politics, but not how it is presented, often feel the distinct need to mention the fact. This tends to pop up within natter upon this very wiki, as if the mere fact that, say, someone has problems with the Roman Catholic Church lends more credence to his negative opinion about The Da Vinci Code.\nOne possible form this could take is a Space Whale Aesop. Contrast this with Strawman Has a Point, when one can't help but agree with the opposite of the work's position, not so much because of one's prior beliefs as because the work did such a bad job of portraying the opposition. This could also lead to a Logic Bomb if your reason for shooting the message is because of the messenger's hypocrisy. Compare Stealth Parody, which can differ from this trope only in creator intent, and due to Poe's Law may be confused for each other. See also Fallacy Fallacy, when a perfectly cogent argument gets wrongfully dismissed as being \"wrong\" just because it uses a fallacy. If this occurs In-Universe, it's Jerkass Has a Point.\nAlso related to Hitler Ate Sugar, when a viewpoint is criticized on the (fallacious) grounds that someone who held it was a bad apple. Those too eager to avoid this characterization may resort to the No True Scotsman fallacy (\"that person isn't a real example of X\").\nAn Inverted Trope of Some Anvils Need to Be Dropped, where a work is improved by the inclusion of some necessary moralizing.\n"}
{"InUniverseCatharsis": "In Real Life a big part of why we love Media is that it is cathartic. It is fun to blow off steam shooting up Mooks, crying over a Tear Jerker, enjoying a Sadist Show, etc.\nThere is also a more serious form of catharsis where psychological ills are healed through ceremony or painful experiences. Basically, usually as a major plot point, a character either seeks or inadvertently goes through an experience that normally only a Nightmare Fetishist might seek, and it helps them deal with a medical, psychological, etc. condition. When a story does this for a reader in the real world, it's YMMV. When it occurs In-Universe, it's less subjective. May take the form of Percussive Therapy or a Cathartic Scream.\n"}
{"LongCon": "The Tale is the plot of a confidence game. It defines the ways in which The Mark will be duped. A con-man crew usually includes a team member called the Roper, whose job is to ingratiate himself with the mark and tell them \"the tale\" of how the Get Rich Quick Scheme supposedly works, thus \"roping him in\". The terms Long Con and Short Con are related to the complexity of the tale. The slang term for these is a \"gag.\"\nSee also The Con, Con Man.\n"}
{"LittleMissAlmighty": "Since most people imagine God as a bearded old man, the natural antithesis of this expectation would be having the supreme ruler of the universe be a young girl instead. Creators will sometimes do this to subvert a viewer's expectations, especially in works heavy with Epileptic Trees and Mind Screw.\nCompare Divine Race Lift, Goo Goo Godlike, Little Miss Badass.\n"}
{"AGirlInEveryPort": "A story device wherein an adventuring character, usually constantly on the move exploring new places, outrunning authorities, or being deployed in far-off lands, carries out several romantic affairs in each of the various places they stop to visit. The character could be a Casanova, or simply trying and constantly failing to find a place to belong. Either way, every place on the map is marked with a romantic conquest, and the character is using the distance or vast separation between locations to give separate romantic attention to each lover, or to start a new life.\nOften Played for Laughs where the character finds themself forced to return somewhere that one of their spurned or clingy lovers lives. Sometimes, they can't remember WHICH lover they had at this particular port, but go Oh, Crap! once they remember who it was.\nSub-Trope of Really Gets Around. Common in plots with Mighty Whitey and Mellow Yellow, Asian Baby Mama, The Chief's Daughter or a Farmer's Daughter.\nCan overlap with Girl of the Week and Your Cheating Heart. Could be a form of Polyamory if the various loves are on board.\nSee also Living a Double Life and Secret Other Family. And see Harem Genre for when competing love interests live very close or under one roof.\n"}
{"MagicFromScience": "The science-fiction equivalent of magic. Magic does not derive from an actual mystical or spiritual source, in fact, it's not really \"magic\" at all. It's just technology that people assume is magic, someone might have even told them such! The characters using this \"magic\" may or may not be aware of its true origins.\nCompare Clarke's Third Law and Runs on Ignorance (where knowing how the technology works makes it stop working). Contrast with Skepticism Failure. For \"Technology From Magic,\" see Magitek. Explaining away magic with Techno Babble or Minovsky Physics is Doing In the Wizard. Conversely, insisting on the magical nature in place of the previous tropes is Doing In the Scientist. Often used by Sufficiently Advanced Aliens. If the audience is left in doubt about its true origins, Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane. Magic by Any Other Name often overlaps with this. See also Sufficiently Analyzed Magic and Post Modern Magic.\nDespite similarity to the literal translation, Deus ex Machina is unrelated. Not to be confused with Magic-Powered Pseudoscience where magic turns out to be the hidden component in a seemingly mechanistic but otherwise inexplicable invention.\n"}
{"ValentinesDayEpisode": "Jewelry, Roses, and Chocolates. Valentine's Day (technically Saint Valentine's Day) is a big deal, and boy do writers know it! The holiday on February 14 has been used a million times in all sorts of media to bring up love and romance. White Day is a similar holiday observed in Japan and South Korea on March 14. In some countries, it's normal to give Valentine's Day cards or gifts to friends and family, whereas in other countries you'd only give a Valentine's Day present to someone you are romantically interested in, leading to a bit of Values Dissonance for certain audiences.\nIn fiction, characters face romantic challenges or break new ground on episodes that revolve around Valentine's Day. A Valentine's Day Episode plot typically centers around hooking up, or with struggling to find the right gift, or with someone (usually the man, usually on some kind of comedy) forgetting about the holiday and struggling to find a suitable gift. There are any number of Love Tropes, comedic love tropes and Sex Tropes that are common to Valentine-centric plots. Can be fertile ground for Shipping Tropes. And likely to be a pivotal part of a Romance Arc.\nWhile many Valentine's Day Episodes will usually air just before or on Valentine's Day, this is not always the case. To be considered a Valentine's Day Episode, a work needs to both explicitly mention Valentine's Day and have a plot focused on love, romance, and relationship, when that hasn't been the sole focus previously.\nAlso in many cases in the media, though Valentine's Day is in the winter (at some latitudes, anyway) it can instead appear to be spring, with no sign of bare trees or snow anywhere, compared to real life.\nFor other holidays see Christmas Episode, Halloween Episode and Thanksgiving Episode.\n"}
{"SnarkyNonHumanSidekick": "You'd be amazed what being small and cute will let you get away with.\nHe may be a sassy little beast with a heart of gold who gripes about the dangers of accompanying the hero, but ultimately follows him or her out of loyalty. Or he may be a sociopath who mocks the idealistic rest of the cast and the villains alike, always getting the last word. His popularity ranges from The Scrappy to fan favourite in the same fandom.

{"TragicStillbirth": "A Tragic Stillbirth is a plotline detailing the fallout and heartbreak after a child dies in the womb. For whatever reason, they ended up dying in the birthing process or prior to labor. While a Convenient Miscarriage can cause characters great grief, a stillborn baby is far more likely to be treated on par with the Death of a Child. This is because a tragic pregnancy is considered a stillbirth if the baby dies after 20 weeks of gestation, whereas a miscarriage is earlier.\nIn historical or pseudohistorical settings, a Tragic Stillbirth puts extra pressure on women who need to produce an heir.\nGhosts of stillborn often appear to haunt their family, especially siblings, in fiction. They're usually Undead Children or even adults, as ghosts of newborns would be seen as too morbid for most viewers.\nCompare and contrast to Convenient Miscarriage, Death of a Child, and Law of Inverse Fertility. Can involve Death by Childbirth, though usually the mother survives. See Birth/Death Juxtaposition and Life/Death Juxtaposition.\n"}
{"CosplayOtakuGirl": "Nearly all characters in anime who are otaku are guys, although occasionally a female fan is included. This could be seen as an attempt at fair balance, but it's noticeable that this will inevitably be a specific kind of fan: the Cosplay fan.\nWhile this reflects a very real trend in fandom popular with ladies, it can come off like an excuse to put the resident cute girl of a cast in a variety of fetish outfits for the audience's benefit if done badly. Especially since the second most stereotypical interest of fangirls tends not to appeal to a male audience much.\n"}
{"OldSaveBonus": "The ability to use old save data (or in rare cases, use of the physical game) from an old game in a new game (often a direct sequel, though unrelated examples aren't unheard of) for a bonus. Mostly, this means a tiny change (such as an acknowledgment of your accomplishments in the first game), or an item that may or may not be useful, but in some RPGs (the main originators of this) it is possible to import the character from the last game, levels intact, to start the new one (the monsters would sometimes be scaled up, of course).\nSometimes, this is a way of avoiding the Bag of Spilling problem. Mission-Pack Sequel games are especially prone to using this, as the sequel is usually built on the same basic code as the previous entry, so it's easy to port over content.\nRelated is the specific bonuses achieved from linking a handheld with a specific game to a console with another. This began with the Nintendo 64 title Pok\u00e9mon Stadium, which has a special adapter for importing Game Boy save data. The Game Boy Advance system has a link cable for connecting to the Nintendo GameCube, the Nintendo DS uses its Slot-2 to connect to GBA games and can connect wirelessly to the Wii, and the PlayStation Portable uses a USB cable to connect to the PlayStation 2. However, this can quickly enter One Game for the Price of Two territory.\nOn one hand, this is a fun way to reward players who have played previous games. On the other hand, this can be frustrating to those who don't have the time or money to invest in another game.\nCompare to New Game+ and Another Side, Another Story, which reward you for playing the same game again after completing it once. Also compare One Game for the Price of Two, when both games are related to each other and released at the same time (like the Pok\u00e9mon series).\n"}
{"MagicIdolSinger": "When a magical girl is also an idol singer.\nThis usually comes in two varieties:\nThis type of magical girl is the one that uses the Wish Fulfillment appeal of the genre the most. While the other two types use their powers to do good deeds or fight the good fight, the Magical Girls here use the powers they gain to achieve their dreams of stardom, although they can use Magic Music. As the protagonists here tend to be too young to be part of the musical industry, Older Alter Ego is often used.\nNote; the character has to be a magical girl, not just someone with music-related powers.\nA Sub-Trope of Magical Girl and Idol Singer.\nCompare/Contrast Evil Diva.\n"}
{"FeedByExample": "This is often done to imply that the character in question either didn't trust the food, or in the case of the Picky Eater, just might not expect it to taste good, wherein seeing someone else eat the same thing was enough to change their mind.\nOf course, part of the problem with this is that just because some food is good for one creature doesn't mean it will be good for another; among those who take this into account even this approach might not be enough to convince them.\nAnother variation on this trope would be \"so good, the taster eats everything.\" This is used more in commercials, where a parent might eat the whole jar of baby food instead of serving the child as they started.\n"}
{"UnwillingRoboticization": "Science fiction often portrays cybernetics as the way forward. Replacing lost limbs, augmenting abilities, even allowing body transplants. But on occasion, a story involves characters who don't want to surrender their fleshy bodies. And that can be handy to know for a villain. This is normally done by dictator and other control freak types. This can be to suppress rebellion, to remove individuality, or to create a robot army \u2013 or a combination of the above.\nThis can be similar to You Will Be Assimilated. Related to Cybernetics Eat Your Soul. Can sometimes be portrayed as a very special kind of Body Horror, akin to zombification (especially in cases where the procedure begins with brain harvesting). Also see We Can Rebuild Him and Emergency Transformation.\nSome devices that inflict roboticisation use nanomachines, resulting in graphic scenes of the person being slowly mechanized while screaming in pain as they are being rebuilt into machines.

{"SongParody": "A song parody is a a specific form of parody that involves taking an existing song, keeping the beat and background the same, then rewriting the lyrics (or possibly adding lyrics to a song that originally had none). Sometimes the new lyrics are similar to the original, sometimes they bear little resemblance. The United States Supreme Court case Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music established song parodies as Fair Use, even when used for profit. Thus, one does not technically need to get permission from the original artist to make a parody, though some (such as \"Weird Al\" Yankovic) make it a point to get permission for any parodiesnote\u00a0Yankovic does this out of principle, i.e. as an act of goodwill towards the artist being parodied to ensure that they don't view the parody negatively, most especially during his row with rapper Coolio, though the two are now in good terms and Coolio extended his apology, stating that he was \"being cocky and stupid\" and should've embraced what he now viewed as something funny.\nIn a non-audio medium such as a comic, making a song parody can be a good way to let readers know how a song is supposed to actually sound, by giving them a beat and tune to keep in mind as they read the lyrics.\nOften times, song parodies are sung To the Tune of... the piece they're spoofing, but this isn't a requirement; oftentimes a Suspiciously Similar Song substitute is used instead.\n"}
{"RockstarSong": "Just as many bands have done a Money Song, and others like to do Silly Love Songs, so too have many bands done songs about being a rock star.\nLike any theme, different bands handle it different ways, but they often mention their origin and rise to stardom; (mis)handling fame and fortune; isolation; the daily grind of life on tour; and occasionally Sex, Drugs and Rock & Roll.

{"EdutainmentGame": "Video Games designed to educate as well as entertain, often, but not always, using the conceit of Alphabet Soup Cans. Edutainment games first started appearing in the early 80's, mainly on personal computers, giving rise to games like The Oregon Trail, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? and Math Blaster.\nEdutainment games reached its peak in the mid 90's with the arrival of The ClueFinders, Jump Start, Living Books and the Humongous Entertainment games. The trend slowly petered out in the early-mid 00's, with companies who previously made a name for themselves making them (Davidson and Associates, Knowledge Adventure, MECC, The Learning Company, etc.) either going out of business or getting merged into a larger company.\nToday, edutainment games are slowly but surely making a comeback, thanks to the advent of mobile apps and rereleases on sites like GOG and Steam.\nCompare Exergaming.

{"SciFiNameBuzzwords": "Out of the confusing twists and turns of Techno Babble and Expo Speak come the Sci-Fi Name Buzzwords. These are short word components that can be clicked onto an existing word portmanteau style to make it sound more sciencey.\nThese tend to rise and fall in favor over time. Using one from a different era can give your technology a retro, period feel.

{"PonyTale": "Back in the day, horses were for men. The gentry cavorted about the countryside on hunters, often in pursuit of some hapless fox; farmers worked the soil with their teams of loyal draft horses; and The Wild West hero galloped into town aboard a trusty steed, perhaps of mustang stock. While women did ride (and drive) horses, this was taken to be a mark of how gentle and tame the animals were: only a Real Man could master a genuinely spirited and powerful beast.\nAround the 1930s and 1940s, however, something changed. The \"horsy girl\" was created, and the Pony Tale was born. Mainly seen as a British genre \u2014 and more often than not, featuring an English setting \u2014 the story is only nominally about the pony. The real driving force of the plot is the development of a central character (usually female) via equestrianism.\nA true Pony Tale features a very specific type of heroine. Usually a misfit, or displaced in some way, she happens across a horse, or a riding school, or some experienced riders out for a gallop. Enchanted, she resolves to become a rider herself. After circumstances grant her a pony (however contrived those circumstances might be), the story follows her progress as a horsewoman, usually involving detailed descriptions of horse care, competitions and the technical aspects of riding along the way.\nThe heroine makes no effort to be \"feminine.\" She doesn't put on make-up. She hates having to wear a dress when Great Auntie Gladys comes to visit. School is a place created solely by evil powers to keep her from spending her entire life in the stables, not a place for socialising, studying (very often she's Book Dumb to some extent, if only through lack of application) or dating. She's barely even aware that boys exist, unless he has a pony with him. Oddly enough, on the rare occasion the hero is a boy, he'll be accused of \"feminine\" traits \u2014 being a daydreamer, for example, or being so useless at other kinds of sport that he gets bullied by other boys.\nThe Pony Tale isn't too worried about originality. This is an extremely formulaic genre, with stock plots, stock plot twists, stock characters (including stock horse characters, no pun intended), and a set of stock tropes.\nWhile this genre has a lot in common with A Boy and His X, there's a twist to it, other than the obvious gender flip. The former concerns itself with achieving \"manhood\", whereas the Pony Tale is not (usually) concerned with achieving \"womanhood.\" The regulars of the stables are almost genderless. Romantic plotlines are rare, and the two sexes will regard each other as equals, at least until the obligatory loudmouth declares a battle of the sexes. This is Truth In Television to a great extent: the Equestrian Sports are one of the few arenas in which the two genders compete on equal terms. The stables are a culture unto themselves, and unless they give up riding, they are the centre of the protagonist's world. This is less true in North America, as everyone over there wants to see a You Go, Girl! story about a girl triumphing where others said she couldn't.\nHowever, this genre is extremely prone to Growing Up Sucks. Ironically, while male heroes may be few and far between, it's the men who are more likely to pursue their equestrian career past adolescence. All too often, the formerly tomboyish, independent female lead will discover boys, decide that her love of horses was just a sublimated desire to get married and have babies (bear in mind how many ponies have much in common with the Troubled, but Cute boyfriend) and quit riding altogether. Some authors avert this by ending the series/novel while the heroine is still young. It's very rare to see a highly talented female rider actually make it to the Olympics or the World Equestrian Games, or even keep her love of horses as she grows up and gets a job. A larger issue that the genre often avoids is the reality that competing a horse at the top levels of the sport is spectacularly expensive, involving animals worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, thousands a year in training fees, and very little chance or earning back an income comparable to expenses. Few riders of either gender (though increasingly the top teams are evenly divided and the US has fielded show-jumping Olympic teams that were entirely female) can manage to make horses a viable full-time profession, at least in the dramatic ways expected in a Pony Tale.\nThe whole genre is rapidly becoming a Dead Horse Trope (no pun intended), on its British turf at least. There could be a number of factors to this, often contradictory ones. In the media age, it could be that riding is getting less popular, compared to video games and celebrity culture. On the other hand, some claim that horses are more accessible now, meaning that anyone who wants to go riding can; they don't have to rely on books for wish fulfillment. Almost certainly a factor however, is the genre's vanishing demographic; its target audience, 7- to 14-year-old girls, are increasingly being steered towards the \"feminine\" culture of fashion, cosmetics and boyfriends rather than the tomboyish Pony Tale heroine. However, the feminine association with horses remains. Just count how many \"fashion doll\" lines feature a pony range. Alternatively, a new type of horse story, aimed at a younger demographic, is emerging that features more traditionally feminine characters who can ride a horse without damaging their manicure.\nNot all horse stories are Pony Tales: see below for details.\nSee also: A Boy and His X and All Girls Like Ponies.\nHas nothing to do with My Little Pony.\n"}

{"DomainHolder": "Those with this kind of power have their own little domain \u2014 a Pocket Dimension, a Mental World, a section of Cyber Space, or a ritually established area overlapping the normal world \u2014 where they have editing rights over the laws of reality.\nThis is to give a character, possibly a protagonist, a challenge they CAN'T solve with their fists, since the first rule such a Domain Holder usually implements is \"Violence doesn't work here, sucker!\" There seems to be trade-offs involved in this case, since often, one of the rules is that the Domain Holder is required to fully explain the Rules to his \"guests\".\nSubtrope (and most extreme form) of Home Field Advantage.

{"AudioPlay": "With the rise of Radio came a new style of fiction: the Audio Play. Although Radio Drama mostly died with the rise of Television, the Audio Play did not; it continued unabated on records and later on CDs, and most recently, on Podcast.\nThe thing that distinguishes an Audio Play from a Dramatic Reading or stand-up comedy is that the listener is generally supposed to think that he's listening to actual events. There may be a narrator, but individual characters usually have their own distinct voices, and foley work (audio special effects) provides a sense of actually being there.\nSome artists like Stan Freberg successfully transitioned from radio to other Audio Play formats, like the record album. Others, like Cheech and Chong and The Firesign Theatre actually started out creating Audio Plays on vinyl, after the death of radio. In Britain, Big Finish makes a popular line of Audio Play derivatives of other works, like Doctor Who. In Japan, the Drama CD, a form of Audio Play, is still popular today.\nNote: Examples that fit under Radio or Podcast should appear there instead. This is an index of Audio Plays that don't fit under either subcategory. (Although not all radio shows or podcasts are actually Audio Plays, so this is not a proper supertrope.)

{"DepartmentofChildDisservices": "We all know that in fiction, There Are No Therapists and Social Services Does Not Exist.\nOn the occasions when Child Services does exist, they are almost inevitably shown to be one of two brands of stupid, if not both:\nThere are other complete fallacies too, like...\nOccasionally, there are the cases in which whatever department is handling Child Services turns out to be actively sinister rather than simply destructively incompetent and/or bureaucratic. Often this is formulated as a political cautionary tale. Depending on the outlet Child Services may be portrayed as heavily biased against devoutly religious, non-traditional families, single parents, or non-custodial parents. Sometimes a perfectly good parent has their children taken away for extremely stupid reasons and has a horrific time trying to get the kids back.\nThis is a common in-universe trope in many works of fiction as well. Characters may stay in abusive situations and even avoid or refuse to cooperate with Child Services because they have heard horror stories about the results of such intervention, regardless of how positively or negatively Child Services is actually portrayed in-universe (a good way to make use of the trope without passing judgment on the department itself).\nGiven the derogatory implications it foists upon social organizations, you could say that this trope is firmly on the cynical end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism. On the other hand, the crusading parents or child advocates fighting the system might indeed be portrayed as idealistic.\nOf course the primary source of the trope is pure Rule of Drama.\nIn Real Life, Social Services are generally pretty good at taking care of children, and in most cases children only need to be taken away for as long as a house needs to get in order. It's just that the news is a lot more interesting when a kid ends up being tortured for years or a foster home is actually run by sadists, than when a child is rapidly removed from a dangerous environment or a foster home is well investigated and in perfect condition.\nAlso, in Real Life, most child welfare workers are caseworkers or case managers, not Social Workers (they may have a bachelor's in Social Work but that's not the same as an MSW or a license). Social Work in the sense it is defined means more than managing a caseload and connecting people to services or resources, or being a professional counselor. It also means having an MSW or an LSW and the training associated with those credentials, which many child welfare staff do not have. This training includes \"micro\" social work that focuses on individuals, families and communities (the most common depiction of social workers), and covers much of the case management/casework and clinical aspect of social work, and \"macro,\" which deals more with communities, larger systems and especially, social policy. Both micro and macro-oriented social workers are trained to be agents of social change, not just caseworkers or therapists, but the formal license is often used by those wishing to practice therapy or counseling. Also, most states have Title Protection, which formalizes the distinction between social workers, and caseworkers/case managers and the various (licensed and unlicensed) kinds of clinical specialists who also work in social services, behavioral health and related and similar fields. Many Social Workers' focus and practice has nothing to do with the (often under-funded, and poorly staffed) formal child welfare system, and many of the more radically-oriented social workers have harsh criticisms of the aspects of the formal Child Welfare System that have led to this trope being common in fiction.\nSee Don't Split Us Up, Promotion to Parent.\n"}
{"VampireEpisode": "This is when your regular cast of beloved characters are dealing with the macabre children of the night, the wamphiri, the nosferatu, the vampire! Then you know you're watching a vampire episode.\nVampires are normally chosen to be in special episodes of non-fantasy shows. One possible reason for this is because they are (in the broader sense) more realistic than other kinds of mythological creatures thus, having vampires in a realistic show may not break realism too much. Of course, if the writer wants to break even less he or she can go for the \"Scooby-Doo\" Hoax ending, the Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane or even the All Just a Dream in order to keep the laws of reality in place.\nThis is the Gothic Horror version of the Cryptid Episode. Normally used for a Halloween Episode, sometimes it's also the Bizarro Episode, it may also overlap with Fight Dracula. Needless to say, this trope applies only to works where vampires are not a common occurrence.\n"}
{"JugglingDangerously": "While it has been done, in Real Life chainsaw juggling is unusual even for highly skilled professional jugglers who want to add the spice of danger to their act. But it's much more common in fiction \u2014 want to take that juggling act Up to Eleven? Just add chainsaws!\nA common yet very dangerous trick that is often performed at sideshows and circuses. It is typical for someone of exceptional bravery to juggle chainsaws while the chainsaws are running. In Western Animation, expect a character to appear fine for a minute before literally falling apart or to fall through a hole in the floor that was caused by the chainsaws.\nOf course, chainsaws aren't the only dangerous things that can be used in juggling. People can also juggle flaming torches, tasers, and swords, which makes this trope Truth in Television.\nNot to be confused with Juggling Loaded Guns, which is more about comedically reckless gun usage than juggling per se.

{"ColourCodedPatrician": "Often, you can tell who is in charge by the colors they wear. This can apply to royalty, nobility, military leaders, and even just the town mayor. Plus, this can apply to all of the clothes they wear or just a sash worn over a fancy suit (as long as they aren't the only one wearing it).\nThis largely started because certain colors were highly expensive and thus, only the most wealthy could afford them. Then the patrician class in Rome declared that the dye Tyrian Purple would be exclusively for them (at least, within Roman territory), hence the trope name. (Note that \"purple\" is actually kind of misleading as a translation; the actual color was more what we'd describe as purplish-red. Don't expect to see this reflected in TV and movie depictions of Roman patricians unless they're being very, very scrupulous with their research.)\nOther expensive dyes included royal blue, vermilion (a type of bright red), or gold. And that is why, in paintings of royalty, their Royal Robes are almost always these colors. Despite this, this does not have to be the Ermine Cape Effect; Modest Royalty can use these colors to ensure people know who they are.\nThus, in fiction, who is in charge, or closely related to those in charge, can often be indicated by wearing colors distinct from everyone else.\nTo fit this trope:\nAlso, this isn't really practiced in Real Life military forces anymore, as that just paints a bulls-eye on the officers. But for that very reason, Video Games often use this trope to identify the leader of a group.\nCompare Princesses Prefer Pink, Graceful Ladies Like Purple, True Blue Femininity, Color-Coded Characters, Color-Coded Multiplayer, Gold and White Are Divine.\n"}
{"TheStationsOfTheCanon": "The inevitable result of a Divergence or a Peggy Sue Fic: You move across the plot points of the original from that point onward, with the intent of showing how the story has changed due to whatever factor has been added to the story. These events tend to be quite fixed, and thus they can, when done poorly, come across as merely crossing over The Stations Of The Canon, rather than an actual plot, which is where this trope gets its name.\nFor example, if you have \"Harry Potter raised by someone else\" Fan Fic, you must cross over the Stations of The Letter From Hogwarts, The Visit To Diagon Alley, The Trip To Hogwarts, The Sorting Hat, and, depending on how you play things, The Troll, all the way up to The Confrontation With Quirrell/Voldemort \u2014 all iconic moments that establish key points of the setting or characterization as the fandom knows it. In most cases, the reason for doing this is to show just how the divergence(s) has changed the story.\nSometimes (but not always) this brings up Fridge Logic involving In Spite of a Nail; no matter what changes have already been made in the characters or setting, the plot somehow twists to allow it to cross the Stations. (If the events in question are on a schedule that has nothing to do with what happens to the protagonist, this particular problem does not appear. After all, if Harry still goes to Hogwarts, he's gotta be sorted by the Hat no matter how different he's become from canon.) At the very worst, the story will be exactly the same as the original just with a few changes in the details.\nSome authors attempt to minimize this trope by either describing the events from a different perspective or simply skipping over a Station with only minimal description of the events. After all, the audience has most likely already read/seen/played through those events, no need to make them go over it again (the obvious exception being a Crossover fic, where a prospective half of the readers might not have done so).\nThis trope is named after the Stations of the Cross, a traditional sequence of 14 (or 15) iconic scenes from the Passion and crucifixion of Jesus Christ in Christian doctrine; in this regard, the revisitation of canonical scenes in an adaptation or a derivative work can be compared to an iconic guided tour allowing pilgrims to Jerusalem to literally follow in Christ's steps. Coincidentally, the \"stations\" evoke the image of a railroad to indicate that the plot hasn't gone Off the Rails.\nRemember that Tropes Are Tools: Fanfiction stories can play this trope reasonably straight and still be good stories.\nExamples should be of works whose fanfic show this tendency, rather than individual fanfics. Connected to Broad Strokes: how broadly the events are painted relates to how many Stations the work bothers crossing. On the other hand, when you hit the broad stroke of a Station the fine details can also be changed up. Compare with In Spite of a Nail.\nHowever, these fanfics will usually add new elements which makes this a zig-zagged trope.\n"}
{"CatBoy": "A Catgirl is a character that looks mostly like a human but she has some parts like a cat, usually the ears, tail, eyes, and sometimes claws or even a natural Fur Bikini. A Catgirl is not furry, and should still have human skin, human hair, a human face, a completely human nose, and a human skull and torso structure. The Catgirl is stereotypically female, though Catboys do exist. (These are usually found in Yaoi, and as a general rule tend to be Uke archetypes.)\nA Catgirl can also have other minor feline features, such as a cat tail, Cute Little Fangs, cat-like Animal Eyes, Femme Fatalons or actual claws. She often has personality traits that conform to feline Animal Stereotypes. She might also have a Verbal Tic that imitates the sound of a cat. She might also demonstrate a Faux Paw. Sometimes her feline nature is associated with heavy sexualisation.\nSome catgirls are biologically Catgirl, either because of some degree of non-human ancestry or because of a change brought upon by Magic and Powers or Applied Phlebotinum. Examples do not have to be defaultly Catgirls. They can be normal humans who have been turned into Catgirls. These catgirls would be a subcategory of Unusual Ears and Little Bit Beastly.\nOther Catgirls merely wear cat-themed costumes, sometimes as part of feline themed Animal Motifs. These Catgirls would be a subcategory of Animal-Eared Headband. Faux kitties will wear at least fake ears, and often a fake tail. Sometimes they wear gloves resembling cat paws.\nA catgirl's ears and tail don't have to be that of a housecat.

{"NoiselessWalker": "Walking isn't a silent action. It can be a loud, elephant-like sound or graceful steps. But people still make some noise when they walk. Except this character.\nMeet the Noiseless Walker. For some reason, his steps are completely silent. This character may have ninja-like skills, or something magical in their nature which negates the sound of walking. It may be used to show he's a badass for managing to move around without people noticing him, or to establish an alien or otherwordly nature because the absence of a natural sound often looks off.\nOr perhaps he just uses artificial means such as a noise-cancelling suit or spell. Such cases are likely to be temporary, unless moving silently is a character's whole shtick.\nThis trope is one of the most plausible reasons for managing a Stealth Hi/Bye (the other being Offscreen Teleportation). See With Catlike Tread for when this trope fails.\n"}
{"VariableMix": "The music for a non-interactive story, like a film or TV show, is expected to change and adapt to the action taking place. However, games have a limited ability to do this. It's not practical to have John Williams watch the player's actions and spur up the London Symphony Orchestra every time Solid Snake gets seen by a passing guard.\nA hard cut to a different piece is one possible solution for a game, and it's not so jarring when disguised by a sound effect. But some titles make better use of their technology: in a variable mix, the background music changes subtly and smoothly depending on what is going on in the game. The running background music could have, for example, parallel parts that fade in and out with the rising and falling action level, seamlessly transitioning from a bare-bone ambient haunting theme to a hard-rocking drum-backed metal anthem during combat, and back again after the last enemy has fallen. A clever bit of composing that has a very subtle but real influence on player immersion. The MIDI musical interface, in which music pieces are not saved as pre-recorded audio but rather as musical notation that is interpreted on-the-fly by the sound hardware, is well suited for this sort of thing.\nOften overlaps with Musical Spoiler for more Genre Savvy players who know what particular variations to listen for.

{"WritersCannotDoMaths": "You're watching a show or movie, or reading a book, when suddenly something numerical throws you for a slight curve \u2014 like a date, or a character's age. Your brow furrows. You start ticking things off on your fingers. What the hell? That wasn't right!\nYou have just discovered the fundamental truth: that your favorite author failed irredeemably at high school math and never wants to see a number ever again except in the corner of a page. This is a particular kind of continuity error that would be avoided if professional writers kept calculators at their desks. It can also come from multiple writers not checking with each other, or screwups in the timeline.\nCompare Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome, Not Allowed to Grow Up, and Longest Pregnancy Ever, where the writers can do math \u2014 they're just intentionally fudging it.

{"GameMaster": "Most Tabletop RPGs isolate one player from the rest to fill the role of the Game Master (or GM), comprising four major \"hats\" to wear:\nOften, the GM is separated from the other players at the table by a cardboard screen that hides his notes on NPCs and upcoming events in the story; many games print custom GM screens, decorated with various tables and charts from the rulebooks, to reduce the amount of book referencing needed during play. Such screens have become less common \u2014 most GMs and players prefer to use their computer to create their own screen, if they ever use one at all.\nGame Masters will often be practiced actors, and many of the better GMs are also talented vocal artists and authors \u2014 for some, they're skills that see a lot of use, and many games have come into legend because of a memorable GM-controlled NPC.\nThe Game Master may encourage a variety of game styles (ranging from dice-heavy hack-and-slash to semi-freeform roleplaying) and moods (ranging from the sadistic and adversarial to loot raining from the heavens).\nNot to be confused with General Motors. Unless you're running some sort of automobile centered RPG. Note that the GMs in MMO Games (RPG or otherwise) are more like moderators with punitive powers but no ability to change the fundamentals of the game itself. They're the cops, in other words, whereas a Tabletop GM is the ruling deity of his or her world.\n"}
{"DeliriousMisidentification": "When a character is ill, delirious, hurt, drugged or otherwise mentally compromised, they will often assume another person coming close to them as someone recognizable to them:\nOften the confused person will be so out of it they won't pay any attention to whomever it is the person says they are.\nWhen the \"delirious\" is caused by hypnotism/illusion (often a common tactic for a Master of Illusion) or hallucinogens, there could be a plot on how to stop these influences.\nA common variant of this trope is for a ghost (or other type of undead character) who has Unfinished Business to mistake living people for someone they knew when they were alive. Ghosts are often found harassing people who bear a vague resemblance to someone they knew while alive, people who share other qualities, or just flat-out everyone they encounter.\nMay involve Waking Non Sequitur or Non Sequitur, *Thud*.\nSee also Set a Mook to Kill a Mook for when this is exploited - by making the mook think the other mooks are their enemies.\nSubtrope of Mistaken Identity.\n"}
{"GameplayAndStoryIntegration": "Video games (and games in general) are a unique storytelling medium in that they demand active participation by the audience (read: the player) in order to advance the narrative. Historically, however, the massive age gap between traditional, non-interactive storytelling and the rapidly evolving interactive medium gave rise to a dichotomy of pure gameplay vs. storytelling, which for the purpose of this article are defined as follows:\nAnother definition would be that the gameplay ultimately revolves around numbers and is governed by mathematical rules, while the story revolves around words and symbols and is governed by the rules of emotional narrative. Either way, it is very rare for a video game not to have any story whatsoever (i.e. the Pong level of storylessness) and, even more so, to not have any gameplay (though this depends on whether you count Kinetic Novels as games), and these two aspects are usually integrated at least a little \u2014 after all, you can hardly introduce pony-breeding gameplay against the backdrop of a galaxy-spanning war story. Similarly, it is often impossible to extricate the \"gameplay\" part from the \"story\" part for some game elements: for example, level design serves a practical function for gameplay, but also conveys information about the game's setting to the player \u2014 and attempting to avoid this by setting one's gameplay in an environment comprised entirely of featureless white cubes would still tell the player something about the game's setting. Additionally, while it is virtually impossible for a game to have no story at all, story is not the only aspect that evokes an emotional reaction in the players, and \"raw\" gameplay can have the same effect in its own right, independent of the context it is placed in.\nSince a gap between gameplay and story exists and despite the medium's relative youth, video games have already developed a rather standardized set of general and genre-specific gameplay conventions. While definitely not as old as storytelling conventions, they are not fundamentally different and game designers often borrow from them without considering how they fit In-Universe. Indeed, very few players stop to ponder why the Player Character's well-being seems to be divided into numbered chunks but the only one that matters is the last, because it's an established gameplay convention and most developers no longer feel the need to justify it. This becomes even more obvious when the game's gameplay rules are adapted from an external source, such as Tabletop Games.\nThis leads to situations where gameplay rules blatantly contradict the story rules \u2014 and such cases are usually easily identifiable and are listed on Gameplay and Story Segregation page. But again, few games segregate their gameplay from the story completely, and there is usually an overlap at least on the contextual or thematic level. Likewise, there are practically no video games where the gameplay and the story are integrated so tightly that they become indistinguishable, if only because the technology for procedurally generated narratives does not yet exist. Therefore, it's more accurate to speak of individual instances of gameplay and story integration/segregation, as a single game can provide examples of both; ultimately, \"gameplay and story integration\" is less of a dichotomy and more of a continuum, and games can be sorted based on whether integration instances outnumber segregation ones or vice versa.\nThe Sliding Scale of Gameplay and Story Integration is then defined as follows:\nThe degree of story and gameplay integration in a particular game is always relative to the \"mean level\" of it in its genre. Story-driven genres like adventures and Role Playing Games, for instance, traditionally feature a much higher level of integration than the competitive Racing and Fighting Games. Note, however, that a particular game's Story-to-Gameplay Ratio does not imply anything about the extent to which its gameplay is integrated with its story. Ultimately, deliberate gameplay and story integration is all about recognizing a particular genre's gameplay or story formulas and interlocking them in a way that is not expected in that genre. Off the above scale lie the aforementioned games that lack either a story or gameplay of any kind, as well as Emergent Narrative \u2014 the metaphorical Holy Grail for some developers, wherein the game's generic ruleset facilitates the players inventing and enjoying stories all on their own. Some would argue that this is what the Perfect Integration sector of the scale is all about, but then again, so are non-kinetic Visual Novels.\nSee also Player and Protagonist Integration, a scale that deals with similar issues regarding exactly where the line is drawn between the \"player\" as an agent outside the narrative's confines and the \"protagonist\" as a character (typically the Player Character) within that same narrative.\nCommon tricks for gameplay and story integration include:\n"}
{"AnimalSuperhero": "Some heroes, such as Batman, Spider-Man and Wolverine, name themselves after, or have powers based on, a member of the animal kingdom. Others actually are members of the animal kingdom, or at least the Funny Animal kingdom.\nThe result of bringing together the most popular action-cartoon genre with the most popular comedy-cartoon genre. Usually come in one of three flavors. One is a Funny Animal comic that is a direct parody of superheroes, and likely to consist of bad animal puns. Usually considered non-canon in most comic \"universes.\" Another type often features Animal Sidekicks and even superhero's pets, and this often is canon, though unlikely to play a very important role.\nAnd the last type, possibly the best known, are straight-up superheroes who just happen to be animals, often of the very anthropomorphic type. You can thank the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for this type being so ubiquitous. Compare with Teenage Mutant Samurai Wombats, although Samurai Wombats aren't necessarily animals.\nWill often have Alliterative Names. Not to be confused with an Animal-Themed Superbeing.\n"}

The idea of operating games electronically is old Ur Example\u00a0 El Ajedrecista was an automaton built in 1912 that played a King/Rook vs. King endgame against a human opponent (the human played the King)  but the first \"pure\" video game is considered to be Tennis For Two in 1958.\nVideo games by virtue of their interactive nature have unique tropes associated with them, the Video Game Tropes.\nSee also Choose Your Own Adventure for a literary precursor to modern video games; Pinball, the distinguished Arcade Gaming predecessor of video games; and Visual Novel for videogamelike works in the narrative style of literature.\n"}
{"ThePowerofLove": "The Power Of Love is a curious thing. It makes one man weep, and another man sing. It can change a hawk to a little white dove. Bring inanimate objects to life. It might just save your life. It makes people want to give up personal freedom to belong to each other. Don't you dare mock it, it's more than a feeling, that's the Power of Love.\nEven more than The Power of Friendship, the Power of Love can be applied in dire situations to make things better. In fact, in many Disney movies it's the solution to everything. Unlike The Power of Friendship it can be applied in Fan Fic to make things profoundly disturbing. It's also an occasionally useful Deus ex Machina.\nCommon applications of the Power of Love include activating an Empathic Weapon, freeing a loved one from mind control, strengthening a loved one, and converting a Real Death into a Disney Death. Even when the power of love is not literally and directly responsible, the scene is often set such that the audience is left with the impression that it was \"really responsible\".\nDon't You Dare Pity Me! can sometimes be overcome by the Power Of Love; however, it may take time, and the love itself must be purified of any pity it does contain.\nThe Green-Eyed Monster may come into play. In more idealistic shows, it is a sign of an immature love, where trust and faith is insufficient. However, more cynical shows may treat it as normal, and even let it overcome Cannot Spit It Out.\nIn cynical times, this can feel like a rip-off. It depends on where you, and the scene in question, fall on the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism.\nLove Redeems evil but it can also turn you evil. Combining the two, it can support said baddies.\nSometimes, love for someone who's threatened can give someone a Heroic Second Wind, especially a Mama Bear/Papa Wolf.\nA more passive but no less impressive display of the Power of Love is its ability to use the Red String of Fate to reunite the reincarnated lovers.\nA Super Trope to Heart Beat-Down, True Love's Kiss, The Love Slap of Epiphany. A Sister Trope to Light 'em Up (light based powers) and Holy Hand Grenade (holy powers) which are generally good.

Occasionally classified as one of the Elemental Powers. Not to be confused with the fanfic.\n"}
{"SmallTownRivalry": "Aliceville and Bobtown are right next door to each other, and they're both fairly quaint, rural towns full of nice loving people...unless you happen to mention one while in the other, in which case all hell breaks loose. The residents of the two towns hate each other with a passion, either due to some old score that remains unsettled or just because they don't like the looks of each other. If it's the former, you can bet the hero will delve into it.\nNote that this is sometimes Truth in Television: small towns are more likely to have residents whose families have lived there for generations and often have rocky histories. If something happened a long time ago to spread bad blood between the two, the current population may well continue the fighting, especially if it's over something still relevant such as boundaries or land development. Team sports, particularly football, are a popular focus point for the rivalry now that cattle raids and arson are emphatically discouraged. Besides, sometimes there's not a whole lot else to do.\nThese towns may have some Feuding Families, or in extreme cases, one town's name may be The Scottish Trope in the other. This trope is also commonly used to throw out the Conflict Ball for a Feud Episode.\n"}
{"YouCanNotGraspTheTrueForm": "Imagine if some non-human entity, such as, let's say, TV Tropes, became a three-dimensional living entity with self-awareness and consciousness, that wanted to sit down and have a lovely little chat. What would it look like? Like a surprisingly feminine, charming little sprite named Trope-tan? Walls and walls of binary code that resolve themselves into a house-like shape? Or perhaps a whole universe, a world, complete in and of itself?\nAt some point in the conversation, the personification of TV Tropes drops a little Mind Screw in your tea: you are not looking at, or conversing with, all that TV Tropes is. You are not even seeing an illusion that TV Tropes is projecting into your mind. Rather, the sheer awesomeness of TV Tropes, the might and immense hideousness of it, or its life-ruining influence bypass your eyes and occipital lobe entirely, and your mind meekly registers it as the closest, safest, yet still comparable thing on hand.note\u00a0For safety's sake, just say The Wiki Witch of the Web put a spell on you You Cannot Grasp The True Form, or else you will Go Mad from the Revelation.

{"ADorkable": "The word \"Adorkable\" is a portmanteau of \"Adorable\" and \"Dork\". That neatly encapsulates this trope. Adorkable characters are \"dorky\" in some fashion. Maybe they're socially inept or shy. Maybe they're really clumsy. Maybe they have some really, really conspicuous character tic that tends to earn them weird looks. Maybe they're just so darn sweet, that it borders on embarrassing. Heck, maybe they're just an out-and-out Nerd. However, rather than making them an outcast, these quirks give the character an endearing vulnerability.\nThis character type is usually male, but can be female as well. While societal norms would seem to suggest that this is the opposite of the (Western) \"Male Ideal\", in reality, many people find these characters appealing: Rather than an over-the-top caricature, these characters are enjoyable and relatable because they're not absurd supermen.\nNot to be confused with the Hollywood Nerd, who are likable because they're attractive nerds, whereas adorkable people are likable because of their dorkiness. The two can and often do overlap, but are not mutually inclusive; if a battle-hardened marine or a grizzled biker has a sweet, shy and awkward personality when he's not being a badass, then he not only still totally counts, but even gets bonus points for bucking the stereotype.\nThis term has become increasingly common in use, and can nowadays be heard at a higher frequency in movies and on the internet. It's definitely Truth in Television, although there is some debate over how much social awkwardness should be glamorized.\nSee also The Woobie and Nerds Are Sexy. May cause Weakness Turns Her On. May also be a Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass, or occasionally prone to getting dangerous.\nIt's also a real word in a dictionary now.\n"}
{"TheUnfunny": "Just because a character's as jolly as a sloth with major depression doesn't mean they can't be funny. A Comically Serious character's lack of reaction to embarrassing, undignified, or just plain bizarre situations can subvert our expectations of embarrassment, hysteria, or insanity and make for comedy gold. When they're not serving as the 'straight man' for all the wacky hijinks the universe throws their way, the character is likely to be a Deadpan Snarker, The Stoic, or The Quiet One.\nTypically works as a Straight Man in the cast, although they may have a quirky Achilles' Heel. Often, they become the victim of Not So Above It All.\nComically Serious characters often turn up in Brit Coms.\nBizarrely enough, has a very similar comedic style to the certain kinds of Cloudcuckoolander, in that the Cloudcuckoolander's comedy often comes from serious reactions to their own oddities, while The Comically Serious's comes from serious reactions to other peoples' oddities.

A Sister Trope to Serious Business, Comical Overreacting.\nCompare No Sense of Humor, So Unfunny, It's Funny, Narm. Contrast Laughably Evil, Dude, Not Funny!.\n"}
{"RiskStyleMap": "In most RTS games, from Dune II on, the single player component consists of a number of stand-alone scenarios linked together in a campaign. In recent years some games have eschewed this, using a world map much like the board game Risk either to allow a measure of choice in what scenario the player wants to play or as \"eye candy\" for the in-story movements of their army. The map divides a countryside, country, world, or even galaxy into distinct political and/or cultural component groups, sometimes uniting small countries into a larger one, or dividing a large one into its components. It's often color coded to help denote larger groupings of states/countries or allies and enemies, and conquering all of one is often a game objective.\nThis is classically called an \"area-based map\". Contrast this with a grid-type map (e.g. chess), a hex map, or a point-to-point map.\nThe player's armies are often represented on the map itself, and can be moved only to a contiguous country (unless the game allows for special \"air\" units or the like). If the game allows strategic combat as well, a scenario where the individual units can be controlled starts, the nature of which usually is determined by the territory in question. In most cases only a few of the scenarios are pre-scripted, with the majority being skirmishes played against the computer.\nCompare Overworld Not to Scale, Point-and-Click Map, Level-Map Display. See also Spreading Disaster Map Graphic.\n"}
{"MetafictionalDevice": "Normally, it would just be Paratext, or a basic building block of the fiction. But somehow, something used to construct the work \u2014 the font of the text, or the formatting, a cute yellow thought/narration box or a dialogue balloon, quirks of spelling, the edge of the filmstrip \u2014 is incorporated into the text, where the characters can interact with it. When this happens, that item becomes a Metafictional Device.\nSometimes this involves Breaking the Fourth Wall; other times, it doesn't occur to anyone to wonder why that pretty thought balloon is visible, and it becomes more of a Strange Loop or Painting the Medium.\nNinja Prop is combining that with Chekhov's Gun. Left the Background Music On, Frame Break and Harsh Word Impact are related.\n"}
{"SpacesuitsAreSCUBAGear": "Sci-fi space suits tend to have exposed tubes leading from the air tank to the helmet, like twin-hose SCUBA gear. Since space suits are fully pressurized, not just the helmet, these serve no purpose but to be yanked out either to provide a moment of tension or an easy way to end a hand-to-hand fight, depending on if the luckless wearer is a hero or a villain. Even if reconnected, this may lead to an oxygen crisis.\nReal space suits have no such dangerously exposed air hoses. Real SCUBA gear has a backup regulator should the first one go bad and the hoses are low pressure. Either sci-fi writers are making commentary on a dystopian future with no safety oversight, they've only ever looked at SCUBA gear (before the 60s that would be everyone) and at other fictional spacesuits that exhibit this trope, or they just need a cheap excuse to add tension.\n"}
{"CosmicEntity": "A cosmic entity is any being who possesses powers so great he, she or it can affect entire worlds, stars, galaxies, and possibly even universes (or in some cases, entire multiverses.) If there is more than one such entity in a setting, there will usually be different levels of power between them, and often specific responsibilities as well, forming a kind of Fantasy Pantheon.\nCosmic Beings tend to not care much about \"lesser beings\" (anybody who isn't \"cosmic\") and any harm (or good) they cause is often unintentional. Because of their level of power, when they cause trouble the heroes are often forced to try to reason with them, use a Cosmic Keystone, or ask another Cosmic Entity for help.\n"}
{"AFateworsethanDeath": "Think death is the cruelest fate? Think again. There are several things much worse: torture, taxes, and tofu, to name but a few. And more often than not, some unfortunate soul will experience it. Originally, this phrase meant rape, but now there's even worse than that.\nThis phrase is usually used in a Just Between You and Me moment by the Evil Overlord as they boast about the agony-inducing Death Trap that awaits the hero for delaying their plans. It's also fairly commonly used as a warning to the hero against seeking forbidden power or knowledge, and consequently to foreshadow the particular Karmic Death the villain will suffer because of meddling with the universe's Cosmic Keystone.\nIf the victim is immortal, this fate may even replace death, which might suck royally.\nMercy Killings are common when heroes find anyone in this state. If the character can beg for help, I Cannot Self-Terminate occurs; if they can act on their own, they are often Driven to Suicide. Indeed, since all involve choosing death over a given fate, the characters often conclude that that fate is worse than death. Contrast Cruel and Unusual Death, for when the victim instead gets a gruesome death that sucks beyond telling.\nSee also: Cruel Mercy, Empty Shell, To the Pain, The Punishment, Room 101, And I Must Scream, and occasionally Cool and Unusual Punishment. Tailor Made Prisons may be this by nature or design in order to torture its prisoner. Not to be confused with A F\u00eate Worse Than Death, though the two can occasionally overlap.\n"}
{"SuspiciouslyIdleOfficers": "In any film or show in which Dirty Cops are secretly in the employ of someone not a member of the police force (e.g., The Mafia or a Corrupt Corporate Executive), said dirty cops apparently have no actual, official duties, and can therefore spend 100% of their time doing the bidding of their secret employer. No mention is ever made of supervisors, time cards, patrol schedules, or other cases upon which the officers should be working.\n"}

{"AllAPartOfTheJob": "The main character's a Super Hero, a Private Detective, a Monster Hunter, a Knight in Shining Armor, or the like. They're in a tough position. Their jobs are difficult. The hours are long and cut into the character's personal life. They work for somebody they despise. And to top it all off, their lives are always in danger.\nThey never get a moment's rest. Every day they're called in for a new mission. And around every turn, some crook or monster is trying to kill them. They suffer injuries and put the lives of the people they love at risk.\nSo why don't they just quit? Because they love the job. To them, a little bit of danger is worth the satisfaction of a job well done. They love doing what they do, either because they enjoy helping others, or they enjoy the exercise, or enjoy the danger itself. Even if they don't like the danger, they realize that if they want to continue doing the job, the danger is just something they're going to have to deal with, because as long as they continue the job, there will always be danger. Not only do they manage to cope with this, sometimes they may actually love the danger, though it's not always necessary. When the danger is the primary reason to stay with the job, it's In Harm's Way.\nCan also be justified with It's What I Do. Frequently says Think Nothing of It and Keep the Reward. May be prefaced with something like \"I'm Not a Hero, I'm...\"\nStrongly overlaps with Humble Hero; often overlaps with Ignorant of the Call.\n"}
{"DefeatAsBackstory": "A protagonist (or some other character's backstory) in a story begins by having been defeated either before the story began, or early on in the story (often in a prologue). While this usually applies to a character having fought on the losing side of a war, it can also apply to someone having lost an important game as an athlete. This defeat forms a significant aspect of that character; fighting on the losing side may have closed doors for that character, or they may be burning for revenge, or they're trying to pick up the pieces and move on. If a character is trying overly hard to prevent a similar defeat from happening again, then they are a Failure Knight. If someone is Sealed Evil in a Can, they will have by design a previous defeat as part of their backstory (that's how they managed to get sealed into a can, after all).\nSubtrope of Dark and Troubled Past.\n"}

It's also a good source of Getting Crap Past the Radar since most children won't get it. If the number is mentioned by a character, the other character is likely to react with Heh Heh, You Said \"X\".\nNot to be confused with 6 Is 9.\nCompare with tropes such as Inherently Funny Words. And when you divide this number by 3, you get the number 23.\n"}
{"RoadCone": "Some Video Games (from adventure games to dating sims) like to feature Multiple Endings as a way to increase replay value, by changing various elements and branches of the plot to reflect whatever choices the player made during the game.\nThis creates a problem when attempting to make a sequel (or adaptation) based on such a game: Which branch (and ending) of the plot gets to form the canon backstory of the new work? The production team must make a decision, and make one fast, declaring one to be the Canon Ending and cutting the other ones off. They're still canon in their original game, but not with regard to the new work.\nIn short, cutting off the branches is when one of the multiple possible endings in a game is considered the canon one in a future adaptation.\nRelated to Story Branch Favoritism: the plot branch that receives the most focus is more likely to be chosen as canon in a sequel. Contrast with Third-Option Adaptation, which ignores all the various plotlines and picks an outside choice. When the next work is also a video game instead of an extended universe entry, this can sometimes be averted with Old Save Bonus or Schr\u00f6dinger's Question. If the branches were selected immediately from character selection, you're using Schr\u00f6dinger's Player Character. See also Canon Name, where a character who didn't have a given name at all in the first game, is given one in the next. Merging the Branches is a specific form of this where events from several mutually exclusive story branches are declared canon, rather than a single specific branch. See also No Canon for the Wicked, where the hero path is exclusively canon in a franchise with a morality system.\n"}

{"AlternateUniverseReedRichardsIsAwesome": "For various reasons, Status Quo Is God in most fictional worlds. Even if it doesn't apply to the characters and overall plot structure, the world and setting itself is unlikely to deviate significantly from its origin. This is especially true when Reed Richards Is Useless, making any and all marvels made by these mad men meaningless to the masses; heroes can invent amazing, world-changing wonders to defeat the amazing, world-changing nightmares made by villains, but there are never any other applications for these things. Before long, people inside and outside the story will start noting that they can only really count on the resident Reed Richards to rectify problems when doing so restores the status quo.\nHowever, all of that changes in stories set in an Alternate Universe, \"What If?\", or limited series. Since it has no effect on ongoing canon continuity, these stories can showcase the full extent of changes (good and bad) that releasing the Phlebotinum of the week would have on the planet. Potentially, this can either restore the coolness of their \"canon counterpart\" or diminish it, depending on the viewer.\nCommon consequences of commercializing their creations consists of the following: Create a near Utopia, or at least drastically improve the world. Causing a \"Science cold war\" between rival inventors. Leaving the world much as it is now, albeit with jetpacks and other marvels.\nDespite the trope title, massive bad change is still playing the trope straight: the point is that it's massive change.\nCompare Villain World, where the bad guy gets his way instead.\nMarvel Comics\nDC Comics\nOther Comic Books\n"}
{"UnexpectedlyHumanPerception": "Unexpectedly Human Perception is the trope where animals perceive (mainly see) the world in a way just like humans, even if in Real Life they have new senses, lack a human one, or otherwise differ from humans in sensory ways.\nThere are ways this trope manifests, such as a non-primate mammal seeing red and green separately, a bee seeing in a non-fisheye way, or things that don't relate to sight, like a caterpillar hearing a wide range of sounds. Another side of this trope is how mammals (or pretty much most animals apart from birds and dragonflies) in fiction rely on sight, rather than smelling (or some other sense) like in Real Life.\nFurthermore, all animals in fiction have the five human senses, no more, and no less. Sight is the only variable, as eyeless creatures will be blind, usually.\nCan be justified if the animal is anthropomorphic, but this doesn't explain how less human characters will fail to use their non-human main sense.\nThis is part of Artistic License \u2013 Biology and Most Writers Are Human. Like with all Artistic Licenses, Tropes Are Not Bad - when we need a clear perspective from the animal in question, all of the animal's unique sensory quirks/flaws may get in the way of the audience's effort to understand said perspective, although this trope is still used with animal senses that are above human level.\nContrast Bizarre Alien Senses.\n"}
{"HealingMagicIsTheHardest": "In speculative settings, magic usage ranges from Utility Magic to world-breaking rituals but very often it will fail at fixing grievous bodily harm or resuscitating a recently deceased person. If healing magic is possible, it will require a disproportionate amount of power to pull off, compared to anything else on the same scale\u2014up to a Divine Intervention. That \"natural\" Healing Factor is looking better by the second.\nThis can be justified by Life being a different kind of energy, accessible only by gods, but a simpler justification lies in the complexity of all living things. Even simply closing a wound is more complicated than just stitching the flesh together, and dealing with organ damage or disease is even worse. In any setting which applies this justification, expect anything as complex as turning someone into a frog to be right out.\nOut-of-universe, this is done to make the characters avoid injuries as hard as they would in Real Life. When you can easily recover from grievous bodily harm or be brought back to life altogether, things get a lot less dramatic and the threats, less credible. An alternative approach to increase the risks is to introduce dangers that are either exempt from magical healing or worse than death.\nCompare All Deaths Final. Compare and contrast Magic Is Rare, Health Is Cheap. See also Rule of Drama.\n"}
{"SupernaturallyDeliciousAndNutritious": "A subtrope of Weirdness Magnet and Horror Hunger; it turns out that someone is literally delicious. Either their blood is, or their Life Energy is far more appealing than most people. Vampires are going be lining up the block, demons give the boutique two clawed thumbs up, and The Heartless are going to come out of the woodwork. Needless to say, this is going to complicate someone's life considerably. It can also be a danger to everyone else if this acts as a Rare Candy and powers the monster up considerably.\nOccasionally, it's the very act of having powers to combat these forces that attracts them, because Magic Is a Monster Magnet. If this person doesn't have any powers to speak of, anyone who has them as their Protectorate had better be prepared for a lot of protecting.\nA variant of this is simply that supernatural beings find this literally pleasant to be around. They're not so much wanting to eat them as... er... \"eat\" them. Or at least bask in the scent or energies and make their life complicated. Often it's a little of column A and a little of column B.\nDo not confuse with Magically Delicious, which is about commercial advertisements.\nMay be inverted by Too Spicy for Yog-Sothoth, also compare with Cannibalism Superpower, To Serve Man, and Super-Persistent Predator.\n"}
{"VampiresVsWerewolves": "In many ways, the legends of werewolves and vampires spring from similar sources, but modern popular fiction has fleshed them out, made them into species, and given them cultural traits.\nTotal opposites.\nLike Elves vs. Dwarves (or Pirates Versus Ninjas) they probably don't like each other. Wouldn't it be awesome if they fought each other?\nAnd they did. And it was awesome.\nOld World of Darkness popularized this trope, but there were some earlier examples. Compare Monster Mash, where they're cooperative, if not friendly. A subtrope of Cool vs. Awesome.\nMay result in a Vampire-Werewolf Love Triangle, the result of which will be a Hybrid Monster... or a childless marriage.\nAs a whole, this trope might be Newer Than They Think. In many legends and folklore that mention both vampires and werewolves, the two are not only not antagonistic to mankind, they are often connected or are one thing, such as one belief that an improperly disposed of werewolf would actually come back as a vampire.\nAnd yes, we know werewolves have fangs too. We just like the alliteration. Plus, just as how you don't think \"zebra\" when you hear hoofbeats, you don't think \"werewolf\" when you hear \"fang\".note\u00a0Technically, it could also be said that vampires have fur. Or at least hair. And depending on how bat-like they may be...nevermind. But on to the examples...\nIndividual Battles\nFantastic Racism\n"}
{"TournamentPlay": "Long before the advent of computer games, tournament play was the highest level of traditional board-games, such as Chess, Go and so on. Regardless of the game played, expect to see only the best tactics and strategies. Knowledge of the Metagame is crucial. Hardcore gamers are welcomed. Scrubs are not.\nGame tournaments are now a Serious Business, where a really good player might be able to make his living off his winnings. Some players even sign contracts with their teams, like professional athletes. Because of this, they occasionally get some flak from other fans who accuse them of being \"Stop Having Fun\" Guys, specifically Tournament players of games like Super Smash Bros., where all items are turned off, and several stages are banned. On the other hand, who wants to lose the finals (and a huge payday) just because a bomb spawned on your face?\nThe \"Stop Having Fun\" Guys trope derives from players pushing tournament rules outside of tournaments.\nCommon games at tournaments are Counter-Strike, Warcraft III, Quake, Street Fighter, StarCraft, and Halo. Nintendo has sponsored Pok\u00e9mon and Super Smash Bros. tournaments.\nDreams of competing in national tournaments and destroying the 12-year old Asian god-level champion tends to breed tourney-knowledgeable enthusiasts whose verbal knowledge of the games they play tend to be greater than their actual level of skill (which is pretty much the case for many announcers and analysts for non-gaming competitive outlets as well).\nSee also our Useful Notes: Professional Gaming page.\n"}
{"WorkingTitle": "The first step in the creative process is an idea. That part is obvious. Coming up with what to call that idea can be troublesome. And if you don't have a name for it, then talking about it is a chore. This is why a lot of works go through a number of names between production and release. The end result may be that you hear actors talk in an interview about a movie they're doing, and then find it came out under a different name altogether.\nWorking titles can also be used defensively, allowing the creators to refer to their project without giving much away. It can help camouflage a ground-breaking project against someone else copying the idea, or sneak an anticipated sequel under the media radar until it is ready for the world to hear about it. Also can be used to get lower production costs for big sequels as locations or prop companies overcharge on big name features.\nIn many other cases, the working title is the originally intended title that was changed because of last-minute Executive Meddling.\nNot to be confused with the British production company affiliated with Universal.\nSee also Market-Based Title and Censored Title (which is what some of the working titles are if they contain curse words or are otherwise considered obscene innuendo). If the Working Title sticks, it may become a Permanent Placeholder.\n"}
{"GameOver": "You ran out of hit points. You lost your last life. The character you're supposed to protect has stumbled off a cliff face. Your Mons have all fainted.\nIt's Game Over for you.\nSo now what? The nicest games might just let you off with a warning, less forgiving games might make it so that Continuing Is Painful or send you back to a checkpoint. If you're really unlucky, then it's back to the start of level for you... or even the entire game.\nOf course, if you're really lucky, the game over screen will simply read Fission Mailed or the game will let you continue anyway.\nThis is, at its most basic, the condition of having lost the game. Some text or animation appears to let you know you've lost, and there's nothing left to do but start over. You can achieve Game Over by:\nIn the earliest games, you had to start over from the very beginning, but later games provided a password so you could continue from a later spot, and eventually game saves to fulfill the same purpose more conveniently. Some games also let you 'continue' from the same level you were previously on. Indeed, the game over has been such an Omnipresent Trope that some games use the phrase whenever you have in some way failed, even if this failure does not in any conceivable way end your game.\nMessaging accompanying a Game Over can include:\nSome games will even give you a game over screen even if you complete the game, using \"Game Over\" in a literal sense, as since you've beaten the game, it is now over.\nA Non-Standard Game Over is a variant that occurs in special circumstances, when you've really screwed the pooch.\nAlso the name of a single by Club Caviar.\nIt is also the title of a book, an adult CGI animated series, and the third Spy Kids movie.\nThis trope is too ubiquitous for a proper examples list; we'd be here all century if we tried.

{"CozyMystery": "A sub-genre of Mystery Fiction where an Amateur Sleuth solves crimes in a small community.\nCozy mysteries are considered \"gentle\" books, with no graphic violence, profanity or explicit sex. Most often, the crime takes place off stage and death is usually very quick (usually by poisoning or being pushed out of a window). The victim is usually an Asshole Victim, and if there's more than one victim, they are usually connected, though the reader is not aware of the obvious connections until the amateur sleuth solves the crimes.\nThe crime-solver in a cozy mystery is usually a very intuitive, bright woman with a down-to-earth hobby or occupation, e.g. cooking, scrapbooking, knitting, painting, quilting, working in a teashop, etc. She may or may not be accompanied by a friendly dog or cat. Male crime-solvers in Cozy Mysteries aren't unheard of, but they are less common.\nCozy mystery series frequently have a prominent thematic element or Pun-Based Title introduced by the detective's job, pet or hobby. There are also cozy mystery series with themes of Christmas, Easter, and other holidays.\nThe cozy mystery usually takes place in a small town or village, to make it believable that all the suspects know each other. The amateur sleuth is usually a very likeable person who is able to get the community members to gossip about each other, and there is usually at least one very knowledgeable and nosy character who is able to fill in all of the blanks, thus enabling the amateur sleuth to solve the case.\nAlthough the cozy mystery sleuth is usually not a medical examiner, detective, or police officer, a lot of times her best friend, husband, or significant other is, which enables her to find out things that she would otherwise not have access to. At the same time, the local police force doesn't take the amateur sleuth very seriously - which, of course, makes it convenient for her to \"casually overhear\" things at the scene of a crime.\nThe murderers in cozies are generally members of the community where the murder occurs and able to hide in plain sight, and their motives are often rooted in events years, or even generations, old. They are typically neither psychopaths nor serial killers, and are often rational and often highly articulate, enabling them to explain their motives after their unmasking.\nWhile cozy mysteries are usually set in a realistic setting, several cozy mystery series include paranormal elements, usually in the form of friendly ghosts who are willing to provide clues or otherwise help out the protagonists. In addition, some heroines are witches or psychics, who use their powers to help other people.\nOn occasion, the crime won't be Always Murder - sometimes the crime might actually be something different, but still something that will warrant explanation and detective work. Sometimes they may even be mundane things like family mysteries or framing. This is especially true in works targeted at younger audiences.\n"}
{"SendMeBack": "So the hero has spent some time trapped in another world (or another time, another universe, or even just another country). Initially, they just wanted to get home, but soon enough, they found himselves wrapped up in the other world's affairs. Then, all at once, they're returned home against their will. But there's a problem. The villain lives. The hero's friends in the other world are still fighting for their lives. That other world still needs saving. Nothing has been resolved. If their \"other world\" was another time (specifically the past), the hero may even find out that their friends all died and that the villain won. However, their original world doesn't appear to be in any danger (at least initially). The hero could stay there and live a normal life, forgetting about what happened in the other world altogether. What is their reaction to this? \"Send me back!\"\nMost of the time, the hero will eventually find a way back to the other world to resolve things, but there are occasional subversions to this.\nCompare Can't Stay Normal and So What Do We Do Now? Occasionally overlaps with Save Both Worlds.\n"}
{"Cuddlebug": "Physical intimacy is a basic human desire. Humans generally want some degree of physical contact. Then there are those who like it a little too much. These people are the type who like hugging and cuddling people, often delivering The Glomp. Combine a Cuddle Bug with a character who Hates Being Touched, and more often than not, Hilarity Ensues.\nTheir skinship reaction is usually triggered by Moe and Cuteness Proximity. When taken to the extreme, it might result in the person declaring I'm Taking Her Home with Me!. Compare No Sense of Personal Space.\n"}
{"NoSympathyforGrudgeholders": "One character has done wrong, which upsets or enrages another character. But the offending character sincerely apologizes to the wronged party and asks for their forgiveness and start all over again. Much to his displeasure, the wronged party rejects his apology and vows to never forgive him for what he's done.\nAnd along came this trope. As a result for the character's unforgiving approach and his tendency to hold a grudge, he is receiving criticism and antagonism from other characters for not being forgiving to the wrongdoer. They knew that the person's apology was very sincere and it was the appropriate for the victim to forgive. They may know that the more the character holds a grudge, he will be just as bad as the one who wronged him. The grudgeholder may realize that the remorseful character is emotionally distraught or will become furious of his lack of forgiveness, which is a bit hypocritical considering that if he really realised that what he did was that bad, he wouldn't feel entitled to be forgiven.\nThis can be taken to ridiculous levels if the wrongdoer never apologizes for his actions or at least his apology isn't sincere enough, yet the victim gets flak for not forgiving him, which brings to the Family-Unfriendly Aesop: forgive one another even if they still continue to torture you. When it's bad enough, the grudgeholder may well let go of their grudge and sincerely apologize to the people around, but then people will still hold him in a bad position, creating a chain of grudgeholders. One reason why this provokes such anger is that if you refuse to accept reparations, you may end up making your destruction a tactical necessity for someone who (no longer) has nothing against you; a form of Don't Make Me Destroy You.\nMany revenge plots will involve a character successfully carrying out their revenge on their tormentor, but as a result, their loved ones become ashamed of him, telling him that he's crossed the Moral Event Horizon which may or may not be true at all. It's possible for the character to feel remorseful for carrying out their revenge, and may undo the damage that revenge has caused. Or maybe not. Expect this trope to be enforced in a work focusing on a character to learn how to forgive.\nThe opposite of Punished for Sympathy where a character receives contempt from others for showing pity, kindness, and mercy to the offender. This can be one of the ways where character is Made Out to Be a Jerkass. A subtrope of The Complainer Is Always Wrong. If the character has deeply injured a third party, the Ordered Apology may be demanded for forgiveness. Can be due to the belief that If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him or If You Taunt Him, You Will Be Just Like Him.\n"}
{"MST3kMantra": "\u201cIt\u2019s just a show; I should really just relax.\u201d\nLine from the theme song of Mystery Science Theater 3000, which encourages the viewer not to worry about details that are irrelevant to the enjoyment of the program. Sometimes referred to as Hodgson\u2019s Law, after Joel Hodgson, creator and original lead actor of MST3K.\nLike Bellisario's Maxim, it is employed in fan communities to ridicule or short-circuit all manner of Fan Wanky arguments and factual inaccuracy entries.\nThe full line, used more rarely, is this:\n\u201cLa-la-la\u2019s\u201d optional.\nTake three deep breaths and recite when tempted to make a Justifying Edit. Many of our very own tropes (including and especially our Artistic License archipelago) have a tendency to get very nitpicky about following or failing to follow core sciences so even we could do with repeating it to ourselves regarding whole tropes.\nTV scribe Michael Reaves simplifies the sentiment even further: \u201cIt\u2019s only television.\u201d\nWhen we consider that the very point of MST3K was itself to mock and ridicule movies for breaches of logic and defective storytelling, we encounter a sort of MST3K Dilemma: a glib assessment of the situation would have it that the show was hypocritical with its insistence that the viewers subject it to less scrutiny than they themselves brought to bear against countless films, but a more careful consideration should lead us to discern that different subjects should be held to different critical criteria. Indeed, what passed for plot in MST3K was little more than a goofy premise to facilitate the mockery of bad movies, and labelling this as \u201cjust a show\u201d doesn\u2019t make it any less good.note\u00a0Amusingly enough, the show did later provide an explanation for these, making reference to the equipment that creates the air, huge boxes of food, the Umbilicus (a space-elevator style hookup via which the Mads deliver things physically to the satellite) and a farm somewhere on the ship, which Mike never noticed.\nOn the other hand, anybody who hopes to promote a movie and insists it\u2019s \u201cjust a movie\u201d and critics should \u201cjust relax\u201d while also expecting they take seriously any Aesop, speculation, spectacle, or anything else of potential value from it is insulting the intelligence of the audience. This is not about critical appraisal, but what is necessary to tell a story. When criticism targets those things that were simply unexplained, only then should you invoke Bellisario\u2019s Maxim.\nAt the same time however, one should be careful that they do not go too far and use this to justify saying that The Complainer Is Always Wrong. Yes, there\u2019s no point in getting excessively worked up and nitpicky about something that, at the end of the day, is just a work of fiction. But using it as a way of brushing off any and all forms of criticism is an equally dangerous attitude to have, and in creators can be a possible sign of a Small Name, Big Ego at work.\nThis concept is Older Than Steam, also being used in William Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night's Dream: Puck\u2019s final speech, which starts \u201cIf we shadows have offended/Think but this and all is mended\u2026\u201d can be condensed into \u201c\u2019Tis but a play/I\u2019faith, I should really just relax.\u201d This was actually a kind of disclaimer, to mollify people in power who may have construed the subject matter of that and other plays of his as blasphemous and obscene. It still applies to this trope, though.\nIn general, this applies to many philosophies, including the mantra of popular events, one being \u201cIt\u2019s just a week in the desert.\u201d\nThe closest thing this trope has to Truth in Television is the concept of thought-terminating clich\u00e9; as The Other Wiki puts it, \u201ca commonly used phrase, sometimes passing as folk wisdom [\u2026] its application as a means of dismissing dissent or justifying fallacious logic is what makes it thought-terminating.\u201d\nSee also This Is a Work of Fiction, esp. as used in-universe in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, to prevent Haruhi from making everything in the SOS film into reality by thinking about it too much.\nSee also Rule of Cool (or Rule of Funny).

{"HairMetal": "A subset of Hard Rock and Heavy Metal, crossed with pop (think of lighters-aloft power ballads), it was popular mainly during The '80s, so called because of the tendencies of the musicians to sport teased, dyed and moussed '80s Hair. Some bands accentuated this by wearing androgynous clothing, spandex and sometimes makeup as well. While none of this was actually originated by Hair Metal itself, the decade's emphasis on visual presentation and stage spectacle has made the style synonymous with the term (which, today, is commonly used in a decidedly derisive tone). To the ire of fans of other metal sub-genres, hair metal codified the general public's image of metal; when a layperson refers to \"heavy metal\" (or even \"hard rock\"), they most likely mean this genre, when they don't think of some weird, heavy Frankenstein of Death Metal, Black Metal, and Slipknot.\nThis is something of a hard genre to pin down musically, considering its name really refers to fashion more than anything else. Naturally, more bands than just the ones of this designation had '80s Hair at the time, and, also naturally, bands vary heavily. However, a few generalized aspects common across many bands are comparatively high-pitched vocals (compared to other metal, some of which has a noticeable bias for low voices), and a sound that seems to echo. Hair Metal also tends to be more professionally produced and less \"raw\"-sounding, making full use of studio engineering equipment and audio modification devices such as reverb and other electronica. Alongside the distorted guitars, hair metal bands also used synthesizers to fill out their sound. Virtuoso playing was celebrated, particularly on lead guitar and drums.\nIt is worth noting that hair metal came into vogue around the same time Arena Rock was on its way out (indeed, Bon Jovi's breakthrough album Slippery When Wet was released in the same year as Raised On Radio, the last Journey album to feature Steve Perry on lead vocals for nearly ten years) and consequently inherited much of that genre's penchant for melodicism which leavened its heavier riffs, vocal harmonies and guitar pyrotechnics.\nHair Metal bands often became as famous, if not more so, for their hard-partying lifestyles, involving drugs, alcohol and promiscuity, as for their music, as befitting the \"decade of excess\". The media response was a moral panic about metal\u2019s allegedly harmful influences on youth.\nThe genre pretty much died out by 1993. There were many reasons, but the best remembered one being the success of Seattle Grunge band Nirvana's Nevermind album late 1991 ushering in a sea change in the public's taste for rock music from hair bands to Alternative Rock. Not only that, but fans of hard rock were becoming tired of hair metal, and some felt the genre was leaning to much towards mainstream pop, particularly due to its reliance on big hit power ballads. The metal scene's savior also came in 1991, in the form of Metallica, a speed metal band whose dark, technical style had gained them critical acclaim and a fanbase so large that they could pack stadiums without much in the way of radio hits. Metallica released their self-titled Black Album a few months before Nevermind, and it too became a monster smash, paving the way for other darker, heavier, faster, technical and/or less glammy bands like Pantera, Slayer, Megadeth, Sepultura and Tool to have major success in the 1990s.\nAs for the hair bands? Some of them gave up the ghost entirely, while others switched their sound to adapt with the times. Bon Jovi was the biggest success in this regard, completely changing their style to adult contemporary while retaining much of their popularity and fanbase. Other big name acts like Ratt and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce failed in their new, darker 90s guises, which both alienated their old fans and got them mocked relentlessly by grunge and newer metal fans.\nIt should also be mentioned that, while some of these bands are still around, practically none of them these days stick to the Hair Metal sound and image of its glory days. So their newer music may not fall under this label.\nHair Metal may have fallen out of fashion for many people, but it still has a dedicated fanbase. If you meet any of them today, you might not want to risk mentioning grunge.\nIn a recursive way, the hair metal look is actually beginning to come back into style due to a variety of factors, those mostly being that the most rabid hatedom has itself become less respected or calmed down via Enemy Mine when all rock and metal died out in the mainstream, that many people began to realize that the looks weren't the reason for the flood of un-artistic, unoriginal music, and that with the resurgence of metal and hard rock outside of the West and in the underground in the West, many of the artists involved never saw the problem to be looks and/or have influences from Visual Kei or scene or similar.\nAlso see Visual Kei, which is what happened when Hair Metal was allowed to grow to its fullest, diversify as a genre of music and fashion, and become a cultural phenomenon, rather than die.\nOften associated with Glam Rock. Almost all of these bands also overlap with Hard Rock, as contrary to the name, it is mostly the '80s equivalent of hard rock, with few metal elements.\n"}

{"RiotGrrrl": "Riot Grrrl = Punk Rock + Feminism (not the straw kind, mind you).\nRiot Grrrl was an underground musical movement popular in The '90s that combined speedy Hardcore Punk with lyrics addressing feminist issues - female empowerment, sexuality, domestic abuse, rape, and other important matters.\nThe movement coalesced around the Seattle and Olympia metropolitan areas in Washington, largely due to its extensive DIY infrastructure (and The Evergreen State College in Olympia), with its roots in the unorganised collective outrage drawn by the Anita Hill judiciary hearings in 1991. Its name comes apocryphally from a letter Bratmobile member Jen Smith wrote to Allison Wolfe, stating We need to start a girl riot. The phrase itself was the name of a zine started by Wolfe, Molly Neuman, and Bikini Kill members Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail.\nRiot grrrl bands largely drew their inspiration from female-fronted punk and alternative musicians of the past, such as The Runaways, The Raincoats, X-Ray Spex, The Slits, X, Patti Smith, Lydia Lunch, Crass, and Kim Gordon. Their music, much like the grunge that was becoming popular around the same time, was based around Three Chords and the Truth, eschewing complex musicianship in favour of raw production, aggressive sounds, and lyrics dealing largely with politics, society, and feminism. The movement relied heavily on promotional means pioneered by punk rock bands in the past, such as publishing various zines, photocopied handbills, collage-based booklets, and cassette culture. Said zines had a definite political bent, featuring commentary and experiences on various important issues such as sexism, mental illness, body image and eating disorders, sexual abuse, racism, rape, discrimination, stalking, domestic violence, incest, and homosexuality.\nWhile many bands in the genre were all-female, some bands (such as Bikini Kill, one of the genre's pioneers, and Huggy Bear) also had male members.\nThe mainstream music world largely misinterpreted the Riot Grrrl movement's political stances and sensibilities, making them out to be Straw Feminist misandrists and generally not caring enough to do the research. They also lumped various female-fronted Alternative Rock bands with the movement no matter how tenuous the similarities were, such as Hole, The Breeders, The Gits, Elastica, 7 Year Bitch, Babes in Toyland, and even No Doubt. The sheer lack of care or research became so excessive that Bikini Kill entered a media blackout around 1993. Kathleen Hanna encouraged all the bands to do the same, but not many followed through.\nThe movement splintered by the mid '90s, disillusioned with its misrepresentation in the mainstream music press and feeling that its radical politics had been subverted or co-opted as less challenging \"girl power\" by various female-fronted pop bands like the Spice Girls and the Dixie Chicks.\nA few bands have a disputed or tenuous connection with Riot Grrrl. L7 probably has the strongest claim to association with the movement, due to organising the Rock for Choice benefit concert. Other female punk bands that are political but didn't identify with the movement, no matter how much uninformed music journalists wanted them to, included: 7 Year Bitch, Babes In Toyland, Jack Off Jill, Spitboy, and Adickdid. More recently, the Russian band/collective Pussy Riot has been compared to the \"classic\" Riot Grrrl bands in some media, chiefly due to their outspoken activism against Vladimir Putin.\nAlso, Hole have absolutely nothing to do with the genre. Courtney Love hated the scene, accusing it of misandry and claiming the Evergreen State College groups cared more about dogma than encouraging free thinking, and mocked the riot grrrls in the Hole song \"Rock Star\" (originally named \"Olympia\"). Yet, some people still tried to claim that Hole was a riot grrrl band. Go figure.\n"}
{"TheKrampus": "Krampus is an Alpine mountain demon who figures heavily in the December traditions of Central Europe. According to legend, Krampus accompanies St. Nicholas during the early Christmas season. Depending on the story, Krampus is either a regular demon enslaved by St. Nicholas to do the Saint's bidding, or is a demon who willingly and gladly works as St. Nicholas's partner. Krampus acts as the Bad Cop to St. Nicholas's Good Cop, warning and punishing bad children, in contrast to St. Nicholas, who instead rewards good children.\nIn the Alpine regions, Krampus takes the form of a giant demon covered in goat, bear or ram fur, his head sporting large horns with a long, slavering tongue often hanging out of his mouth. Depending on the story, Krampus may have chained shackles on his wrists, signifying his enslavement to St. Nicholas. Generally though, Krampus will be wearing several large bells (as a warning to any who hear them that he's coming), along with a large wicker basket and birch rod. If someone has been bad, Krampus will either threaten a beating with his birch rod or actually give one. If his target has been particularly bad, then Krampus stuffs them into his wicker basket, and drags them off to punish them for their crimes. Depending on the story, Krampus will either bring them to St. Nicholas's home, Krampus's own mountain underworld, Hell, or twelfth-century Moorish Spain.\nTraditionally, young men in Southern Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechia, Switzerland, Croatia, Slovenia, and even Northern Italy dress up as the Krampus during the first two weeks of December, particularly on the evening of December 5, known as Krampusnacht, and roam the streets in grand, sweeping parades through town. Often, they will go after adults in the audience who are in on the fun, especially tourists encountering their first \"Krampus Parade\" or attractive young women. Curiously, despite their fearsome appearance and reputation, the (plural) Krampusi are generally fairly kind to children, generally exempting them from the shenanigans they pull on the adults.\nDespite the frightening overtones, Krampus is quite a popular character in the Alpine countries. He brings some harmless \"scary\" fun to the Christmas season, not unlike what happens at Halloween. He is also not alone as the companion of St. Nicholas. Compare him with Knecht Ruprecht, a German character who performs a similar role (though more as a stern authority figure than a nasty devil), Zwarte Piet, a Dutch character said to put bad children in a sack and take them to Spain, the Lady Perchta, a female version of Krampus who can either be drop-dead gorgeous or hideously ugly, P\u00e8re Fouettard (Father Whipper), a French version usually depicted as a black Santa Claus, Czech chort putting naughty children in a sack and bringing them to hell, and The Yule Lads, a group of 13 Icelandic troll-like beings who historically caused mischief during Christmas, but became more Santa Claus-like in modern times . See also Bad Santa, which the Krampus is occasionally portrayed as. If The Krampus and Santa Claus are the same person, see Santabomination.\nIf you're looking for the 2015 horror movie, see Krampus.\n"}
{"PointlessDoomsdayDevice": "The Time of Myths was a dangerous age to live in, with Eldritch Abominations on the loose, evil gods eating souls and whatnot. So it's not surprising that after becoming Sufficiently Advanced, the Precursors made superweapons to defend themselves and make the galaxy or planet a safer place for their descendants. Conscientious precursors will dismantle or at least disable these weapons while preserving them for later use \u2014 usually by scattering the component Mac Guffins across the cosmos or placing some kind of condition for activation (say Virgin Power, or innocence).\nOf course, most precursors tend to be either neglectful or outright abusive. What this means is that they will make these superweapons for no particular reason other than that they can. And even Benevolent Precursors might have rogue elements or simply have their superweapons seemingly destroyed and thought lost amid the casualties but in fact thrown through time. The weapon itself may have had legitimate use once upon a time, but after making the planet destroying espresso machine to defeat Somnus the Snorer of Worlds, they will completely forget about ever having made it and leave it in an easily accessible location. The device will (of course) be immune to the ravages of time and ready to use minutes after being found. Worse, the precursors may not have even labeled the thing! So for all intents and purposes it seems like a normal espresso machine... which will destroy whatever planet it's on after one use. Of course, every villain or misguided soul in the setting will do whatever it takes to possess and activate the device, sometimes without even realizing (or underestimating) the danger it poses.\nAlternatively, it represents something powerful with great potential for abuse that is knowingly left behind. Lastly, it can also include examples of Sealed Evil in a Can where the evil could easily have been defeated, but wasn't for no good reason, forcing people to deal with an unrepentant and now further insane monster in the future.\nIt's as if the the US and Russia decided to \"get rid\" of all their nukes by putting rune encrusted marble doors outside every missile silo and left it at that. Oh, and the runes spell out \"Come in, there's punch and cake! Just turn both keys at the same time\".\nNot to be confused with the \"plain\" Doomsday Device.\n"}
{"TheBigGal": "In any decent Five-Man Band, someone's gotta be the powerhouse.\nThey are usually unflinchingly loyal, and often they are the largest member of The Team and more effective in combat than anyone else. (Sometimes combined.) They will often be the point man that holds off the mooks while the others challenge the Big Bad. While The Leader and The Lancer fight side-by-side, The Big Guy can be a One-Man Army. Against stronger enemies they might end up suffering The Worf Effect; getting trounced to set up the villain as a credible threat.\nUsually what holds them back from leadership is being Dumb Muscle, they know how to knock heads together but don't do much in the way of strategy. Despite this, as renowned warriors, they may still exercise authority over the support troops.\nNote: The Big Guy may not necessarily be the strongest in the team, (and usually isn't by the end.) They just have to be the one who, out of most duties, specializes in physical fighting.\nTraits common to the Big Guy include:\nPowers and skills common to the big guy are:\nMore women are filling this role, which used to be a rarity unless the whole team was composed of women. Since physical strength is usually a masculine trait, she may be a tomboy, Lad-ette, or if she's not lucky mannish. But you can flip this on its head by making her the Amazon: big, and beautiful.\nIf she's playing the tough guy straight, her softer side is often a secret cache of girlish habits which she finds embarrassing. On rare occasions, she may be revealed to be a Butch Lesbian, a Tsundere, or even a Violently Protective Girlfriend.\nWhen there are Two Girls to a Team, the Big Girl and The Chick commonly form a Tomboy and Girly Girl pair. Most of the time, the Big Girl is the tomboy and the Chick is the girly girl.\nNot to be confused with that other Big Guy.\nCan have some overlap with Scary Black Man and the Proud Warrior Race Guy especially when dealing with dwarves. Often a victim of Big Guy Fatality Syndrome.\n"}
{"FaceDesignShield": "Shields can have some amazing and intricate designs on them. In particular, those resembling faces. Probably for intimidation.\nNo, this isn't about masks. Compare with Rage Helm.\n"}
{"ShowStopper": "A performance or performer that evokes so much applause from the audience that the show is temporarily interrupted.\nFor obvious reasons, this is primarily a theater and live performance trope, as static audiences can't exactly rise up and give a standing ovation in a movie theater. It can still be parodied in that context, though, as pretty much everyone knows the basic idea behind a show stopper. Indeed, such meta-awareness dates to early 20th century film, if not earlier \u2014 it's an essential part of the live performance genre. Sometimes the script might actually call for the actors to nod toward the fourth wall in thanks.\nA sillier variation, often enforced by a Laugh Track, is where a single character, simply by appearing on the stage, evokes such thunderous applause from the audience that everyone has to take a break before any lines can actually be said. Note that in original theater this was still part of the point. Back then it was called a clap trap \u2014 a part of a play or a musical performance designed to evoke applause, with a pause in the action to accommodate it. Since then, the phrase has been used to mean nonsense.\nThis is the supertrope to Epic Rocking.\n"}
{"ConcussionFrags": "The hero dives behind cover, narrowly dodging several bullets and appearing to be safe. But it's not meant to be; an enemy mook grabs a frag from his belt, shouts \"frag out!\", and immediately lobs the grenade at the hero. He manages to crawl a few paces away before the frag erupts into a massive fireball, tossing the hero through the air; amazingly, the hero runs off, apparently unscathed except for a few burns. He just survived an encounter with a concussion frag.\nOf course, this isn't how it works in Real Life. Real frag grenades throw shrapnel, with an injury radius of fifteen meters and the ability for individual fragments to reach out to 250; these fragments, of course, are no more likely to throw you into the air than a normal bullet (let us rephrase that...). The Hollywood portrayal of grenades are closer to concussion grenades, which rely upon sheer explosive force; this gives them a much shorter range than frags, which is why modern militaries rarely use them.\nThere are several types of concussion frags seen in media:\nThis is usually considered an Acceptable Break from Reality in video games, since frag grenades that behaved realistically would be extremely frustrating to play against.\nRemember, this only applies to grenades that look like or are referred to as frags. If things are exploding when they shouldn't, the object is Made of Explodium. For stun grenades, see Blinded by the Light. May cause an Impairment Shot in video games. When frags are presented realistically, expect a bad case of The Coconut Effect.\n"}
{"GeniusSweettooth": "Thinking requires energy, right? Some characters do more thinking than others. These characters will need to have a quick pick-me-up on hand, and most decide to eat some sweets. Perhaps the origin of this trope is the idea that showing a character eating sweets is a way to give the viewer clues as to their hyperactive nature, and it is harder to show the genius's mental hyperactivity on screen than another character's physical hyperactivity. Geniuses on TV also tend toward the socially immature and the eccentric, and showing them eating candy may be a clue to this. Even if a genius character isn't constantly bingeing on sweets, if they have a Trademark Favorite Food, it is likely to be sweet in flavor.\nThis is Truth in Television: the brain uses glucose as its primary source of energy and not getting enough is bad. Therefore, if you need to make your brains work a lot, you may need at least some sweet food...\nContrast Is It Something You Eat?, where a character reveals their love of food, and their idiocy. Compare Must Have Caffeine, which often overlaps. See also Cast from Calories and Donut Mess with a Cop.\n"}
{"PublicBathhouseScene": "When people are seen going to and bathing in a public bath. Public baths have appeared in many cultures, from the ancient Romans to the Russians and Japanese. Usually gender segregated, everyone spends their time washing off and relaxing with their fellow sex.\nPublic baths frequently appear in media from countries such as Japan and Turkey, where they are still commonplace. They are usually used by lower class citizens who don't have a bathtub in their home (just a shower), or when the household's bathtub is not working. When going to and from one, expect everyone to be wearing a really plain towel and carrying a bath pan with shampoo and conditioner\u2026 which can be used as a weapon if needed, and finally drink some nice, cold milk after they get out.\nDifferent cultures have particular customs associated with the bathhouse, as well as localized names: in Turkey they are called hamam, in Korea jjimjilbang, and in Russia banya. A Japanese bath house (referred to as a sento) will always have a large wall painting of Mt Fuji in the background, as bathing in the shadow of Mt Fuji is good luck. In modern Finland, the use of steam bathhouses called saunas is not only a popular communal activity, but an integral part of family life.\nScenes come in two types: washing up (with extremely high chance of Fanservice) and then relaxing in the bath talking. Depending on the media, chances of \"skinship\" or Ho Yay subtext are very high; guaranteed, in fact, if a female Lovable Sex Maniac is around. If a male Lovable Sex Maniac is present on the male side, expect him to try to sneak a peek at the girls' side, if the baths aren't already co-ed. On the other end of the spectrum, the bathhouse can be the ideal place to carry out a murder: potential victims will likely be unarmed and vulnerable, and in the event of a struggle, the abundance of hard surfaces alone are a magnet for lethal head trauma injuries.\nCensor Steam is usually on, as well as conveniently placed soap bubblesnote\u00a0at least in the TV version \u2014 if there is a Too Hot for TV version then these will be removed.. You may also see characters carrying a Modesty Towel into the actual bath, although in Real Life, towels are almost never allowed in.\nThis type of scene is so common in anime there is even a wiki that catalogues them.\nRelated to Hot Springs Episode and Furo Scene.\n"}
{"IdenticalAncestor": "A character's descendant or ancestor is physically identical (or would be, except for small cosmetic changes) to the character himself, and often has the same name. A subsection of Uncanny Family Resemblance. Of course, he might just be his own ancestor.\nThis is normally the result of budget considerations when casting Time Travel stories, the consequence of having a long-term contract for a star when a show permanently jumps generations for some reason, or an excuse to do an Elseworld story with essentially the same character in a different setting.\nIf the character and descendant are one and the same, then that's My Grandson Myself.\nDespite the name, the trope is limited to neither males nor grandchildren.\nThis trope gets somewhat disturbing if you over-think it. Having one's grandparents look exactly like their grandchild and said grandchild's mate has pseudo-incestuous imagery.\nUsually an Averted Trope by this point. Compare with Visions of Another Self. When it's the life story that's identical, the character is a member of Generation Xerox.\nGenerally the result of one of three things:\nOf course due to similarities in genetics this can be compared to a Real Life version of the animation trope Only Six Faces.\n"}
{"DeadlyLunge": "Imagine being in the middle of a Zombie Apocalypse. You rush to some safe place, but the way is blocked by a few aimlessly shambling zombies. Well, no big problem \u2014 zombies are slow, aren't they?\nWell, it seems that getting close to a zombie triggers some reflex in the remains of its brain, resulting in a really fast lunge which, apparently, you weren't prepared for. Too bad for you.\nFrequently featured offscreen: in every zombie film some character is due to be ambushed by a zombie, which then suddenly lunges into our field of view.\nThe trope isn't limited to just zombies, see below. The lunge may be replaced by a jump or a sprint, the essence being the same: drastic increase of speed triggered by prey proximity.\nNote that the trope does not apply to the enemies which just have a surprisingly long attack range (e.g. stretching hands) or which are always fast (e.g., 28 Days Later).\nThis is a favored tactic of the Personal Space Invader. Not to be confused with a Deadly Lunch, which may be thrust unexpectedly at one by a Lethal Chef.\nCompare Ankle Drag.\n"}
{"ItIsDehumanising": "As You Know, in the English language, pronouns are divided into \"he\" or \"she\" depending on the gender of the person you're talking about. Referring to someone as \"it\" is incredibly rude, as the pronoun is almost entirely used for inanimate objects or wild animalsnote\u00a0but not pets, which do tend to be referred to with gender pronouns (often in the latter case even if the animal's sex is known, as it smacks of anthropomorphism). Calling someone \"it\" is therefore tantamount to denying he or she is a real person. (Well, much of the time. \"Who is it?\"/\"It's George\" is standard English, although technically \"Who are you?\"/\"I'm George\" would be more correct.)\nThis trope is when a character is referred to as \"it\" in fiction. Perhaps the person who is referring to the character is a fantastic racist. Otherwise it may refer to an Eldritch Abomination, which indicates that the being is too inhuman to empathize with, despite its intelligence. Perhaps the person in question is of undetermined gender or even just doesn't have one. The worst victims of this trope are probably Artificial Humans and Ridiculously Human Robots. Also used to demonstrate a character's prejudice against a transgender character; sadly, this is Truth in Television as well.\n\"One\" is sometimes used (as in \"One does not simply walk into Mordor\") but isn't universal across the Anglosphere; is often considered in British English to be extremely archaic, upper-class and pretentious; and can be awkward when the speaker is referring to a specific person, especially if that person is standing right there.\nSub trope to Dehumanization, Dehumanizing Insult and Expository Pronoun. Compare What Measure Is a Non-Human?, Do Androids Dream?, and Pronoun Trouble.\n"}
{"IzchaksWrath": "In some games, the player is expected to grab everything not bolted down. In other games, you have the option of not paying for wares at a shop, but doing so makes a shopkeeper attack you or send powerful mooks against you. Often, the attacker will be an Invincible Minor Minion that you have no choice but to outrun. Good luck with that. Other times, they'll just be brutally overpowered, to the point that they could probably tackle the dungeon themselves and conquer it without even breaking a sweat. Either way, you'll probably be wondering why you're even allowed to try to shoplift, seeing as it near-inevitably results in you suffering Yet Another Stupid Death.\nSee also Badass Bystander, Super-Stoic Shopkeeper.

{"SuddenLackOfSignal": "Whatever this place is, it doesn't look familiar. You don't recognize anything about the landscape, and the sky... is unlike any sky you've seen before. Troubled, you pull out a cell phone to call for help \u2014 but even though your phone is working fine and you're in an open area, there is no signal. Your GPS isn't working, either; it claims that no satellites can be detected. Yup, definitely not in Kansas anymore.\nIn today's era, when nearly everyone carries a cell phone on a regular basis, the sudden, initially inexplicable lack of signal can often serve as an early tip-off that our characters have found themselves Trapped in Another World. Maybe they're on an alien planet, an alternate universe, or have time-travelled into the past \u2014 in any case, there are no communication towers anywhere. Obviously this also applies to other communication devices such as radios, the Internet etc.\nIn such a situation, obviously, Cell Phones Are Useless. Contrast The Web Always Existed and Super Cell Reception.\n"}
{"AdaptiveArmor": "Powered Armor is a very fearsome tool and weapon, even capable of making the wielder a Lightning Bruiser with the Alpha Strike capability to One-Hit Kill most enemies. However, despite its potential for great versatility with in built Swiss Army Weapons, it will always look and do the same things regardless of the driver.\nThis isn't the case with Adaptive Armor. Whether it's a benevolent symbiotic entity, a mystical suit of armor, or armor so advanced it seems magical, this suit of armor will adapt itself to any wearer in order to enhance their greatest strengths and potentially minimize their weaknesses, even going so far as to give the driver a form of Personality Powers based on their desires or talents.\nThe adaptability doesn't stop there, either. The armor likely has a greater or lesser chance of giving the wearer a Swiss Army Arsenal, resistance via exposure to enemy attacks or environmental hazards, and a Healing Factor courtesy of Nanomachines, Power Crystals or biological symbiont. Sometimes these powers act like a Swiss-Army Superpower that become \"set\" as the wearer needs them, until the armor stops being able to \"adapt\". The armor itself is likely to have a mind of its own, if not at least a personality that makes its moods known to the wearer. In these cases, the mind can usually activate the armor's Heroic Safe Mode to protect the user in case of accident, unconsciousness or Mind Control. Mind the Tranquil Fury with no regard to friend and foe.\nAlso, in a pinch it can change appearance based on the wearer's alignment. If there's more than one suit of Adaptive Armor or the wearer ever loses the armor or has it forcibly separated, anyone else who wears it will have a similar but distinct look, or it will be incensed that it's been stolen and work against its new \"master.\"\n"}
{"TalkingToPlants": "Many gardeners claim that talking to plants helps them grow faster.\nPeople talking to their plants in fiction is often used to show how boring they are. A common shtick, especially in cartoons, is for the plant to die of boredom as a result. Leaving jokes aside, this is often done by characters who are feeling lonely or secretive and instead of just speaking to themselves choose to project their thoughts to another living thing.\nOddly it's truth in television, as plants require carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, which humans and other animals exhale. The act of talking to the plant can also help the human in question forge an emotional bond to it, which tends to result in said human paying more attention to and taking better care of said plant.\nLess commonly, they talk back usually in ways that cannot be translated into words as The Empath can see or perhaps feel things from their point of view and through their senses.\n"}
{"RealWomenNeverWearDresses": "A woman is shown as weak, incompetent, and ineffectual unless she dresses and behaves in a masculine manner, or is otherwise applauded for being \"not like other girls.\" A variation is a Tomboy and Girly Girl scenario, where the tomboy is presented as superior. It's not hard to spot the Unfortunate Implications: that traditionally feminine traits are worthless and women must \"masculinize\" themselves to be taken seriously. It takes the old prescriptivist gender roles and merely inverts them, creating a new prescribed gender role that female characters must adhere to or be shunned.\nAnd yet, the trope persists, and we record it. Between a woman in trousers and one in a dress, the odds are the trouser lady is going to be the Action Girl of the pair and the one in the dress is going to be a Damsel in Distress. Variations exist, of course, especially in works after the third-wave \"Girl Power\" feminism. Many of the straight examples are from older works, when having proactive female characters at all was fairly edgy.\nSee also Girly Girl, Pink Means Feminine and the various tropes on Acceptable Feminine Goals and Traits.\nCompare Stop Being Stereotypical. Contrast Girly Bruiser, Lady of War, Silk Hiding Steel, and Kicking Ass in All Her Finery, where it is the feminine lady who is presented as capable, and Vasquez Always Dies, where trouser-wearing and competence aren't enough to keep a woman alive. Compare Female Misogynist. A woman who Hates Wearing Dresses might dislike dresses due to this viewpoint. See also Girl-Show Ghetto, where a dominantly feminine \"girly\" work is considered lesser quality, presumably due to this.\nNote: This is not an audience reaction trope. Only add examples where a character is derided by another character in-universe for having traditionally feminine traits, or where the work itself clearly portrays femininity as a sign of weakness, incompetence or inferiority compared to other women.\nIt's also common in fanfiction to see the inversion: the tomboyish Action Girl, or even a girl who just doesn't care about her looks, undergoes a makeover (or hits a growth spurt) and suddenly develops an interest in fashion and flirting, and she turns into an eyelash-batting avatar of the writer's wishes and dreams. This was even a joke in the Harry Potter fandom, that any fanfic that started out with \"Hermione had changed a lot over the summer...\" will not be good.\n"}
{"GeneticAdaptation": "This is a counterpart to the Fisher Kingdom, except it is the outsiders that willingly impose the transformations upon themselves, rather than the environment.\nFor example, humans are attempting to colonize an alien planet, but unfortunately, it's quite unpleasant to live on: to actually survive on the planet, you'd either have to wear space suits and build sealed cities to shield you from its atmosphere and hazards, or go native. But if you have the technology, you can do exactly the latter: Change and adapt your species to enable you to survive on the planet and become one of its native inhabitants.\nThere are two ways of doing this: The short-term version affects specific individual persons only, while the long-term solution affects the entire colony, becoming a part of the planet's evolutionary chain, possibly becoming a dominant species with the original humans remembered only as ancient Precursors. Over time, the transformed may also become mentally alien as well as they adapt to the planet's nature, or the mental changes are immediate and directly connected to the process of transformation.\nExpect lots of Hollywood Evolution and LEGO Genetics.\nIf the transformed species ever meets its original version, expect to find An Aesop about What Measure Is a Non-Human? (if from the humans' point of view) and/or Humans Are Bastards (if from the natives' point of view).\nWhen humans are the ones subjected to the trope, it often results in Human Subspecies and/or Transhuman Aliens. Heavyworlder and Lightworlder are specific subtropes adapted to differing gravities.\nNot to be confused with Empathic Shapeshifter. Compare Adaptive Ability.\n"}
{"FissionMailed": "Phoenix Wright has lost, the trial has ended, and the judge has declared \"Guilty\". That One Boss smashed Link into powder and his fairies haven't done anything. Sonic the Hedgehog doesn't get there fast enough and Dr. Eggman wins. But don't worry \u2014 a key witness has burst into the room just in time, the princess has magically rescued you from afar, or you can go back in time and try again. The player hasn't failed their mission after all.\nFission Mailed is whenever it appears you have lost the game, sometimes so far as to present an apparent Game Over screen, but in fact you had to fail in order to advance the plot. The title comes from Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, where there is a rare clue: what pops up is not the authentic \"Mission Failed\" screen, but rather a spoonerized version.\nA variety of But Thou Must!. If very few clues are given, this is often one type of Guide Dang It!. Especially so if you're playing a game that allows reloading a savegame at any moment, and you have a tendency to reload as soon as it even looks like you've died. If it occurs outside of a cutscene, this can be briefly mistaken for a case of The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard, especially if it involves controllable combat. Fission Mailed often occurs on a fake Final Boss. Hopeless Boss Fights in general are a subclass of this trope. Contrast Kaizo Trap, which is when it looks like you've won, but your \"victory\" is actually impending death.\nNot to be confused with any conjunction between nuclear weapons and the postal service nor between nukes and chainmail.\nSee also Failure Is the Only Option and Death Is the Only Option. This trope can sometimes be invoked via Secret Test of Character. Can be a part of Playing the Player.\nBe wary of mild intrinsic spoilers.\n"}
{"GlobalCurrencyException": "Because many games have Money for Nothing economies, many RPGs include an area where your regular money just doesn't work. It may be a gaming center that runs on tokens, an insular country that doesn't accept standard currency, or a city inhabited by monsters - but one way or another, your money is no good here. Sometimes there's a way to convert your normal money into this alternate currency (usually at an obscenely bad ratio), but often there's nothing for it but to complete sidequests and minigames.\nOccasionally this area is home to the Infinity +1 Sword, though this doesn't make either any more useful.\nNot to be confused for Weird Currency.\n"}
{"TakeOvertheWorld": "Of course! Why would any reputable villain or Imperialistic Global Superpower set their sights on anything less than World Domination\u00ae! As Evil Plans go, world domination is ambitious, more logical and sometimes easier than wanton destruction of everything. They want to be in charge of everything and everyone. This could be just to feed their massive egos and Greed, or else they've got somewhat twisted ideals that they want everyone else to adhere to. Sometimes it's because world domination is the Path to a Better Future. Or it's just because they are dicks.\nEither way, this ambition will put them in direct conflict with the heroes, whether professional or \"I just want everything to go back to normal\" types. Usually said villains fixate on the hero or someone/thing close to them as being part of their master Evil Plan. For a villain who has finally acquired godlike power, and did not use it to Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence or euthanize the universe, then this is the next logical goal and use for said power.\nVillains who want this will occasionally combat other villains who want to destroy the world or use it for other purposes, and sometimes, just sometimes, team up with the heroes to do it. After all, you can't conquer the world if it's destroyed, right? Whether or not the villain attempts to stab the heroes in the back the instant the world is safe, or they nod and civilly go back to their Secret Lairs in a gentleman's agreement to face each other tomorrow depends on the villain.\nThe result of world domination is sometimes subverted, parodied or deconstructed when the villain actually succeeds, and it turns out that ruling the world isn't nearly as gratifying as they thought it would be \u2014 exactly what does one do with the world once one has it, after all? As any immortal would tell you, ideas to try for the world (whether utopian or dystopian) can be limited. Plus, once you're ruling the world, you literally have to be in charge of everyone, and that's like herding giraffes. Seven billion giraffes, as a matter of fact. You actually have to run things, and make sure it works, and dang, Dystopia Is Hard. You will end up snapping or getting crushed under the workload of trying to dictate everything. If they did it with Mass Hypnosis to get rid of The Evils of Free Will, then it'll be considerably easier to rule... and so dreadfully boring they undo the whole thing just to have someone to talk to. No wonder that \"illogical\" world destruction has an appeal that competes with world domination.\nThe more fleshed-out villain will have some specific perception of what is wrong with the world and believe that a strong central authority with vision and strength of purpose can set it right.\nFor more information, check out the Evil Overlord List, a detailed guide on what an evil overlord should and should not do. Typically, this is accomplished with Stock Evil Overlord Tactics. Although sometimes the plans of villains with this motivation go rather in the Missing Steps Plan direction.\nThere have been several country-specific SubTropes which have been popularized in American thought and media, each country taking its turn to be the boogeyman for a few decades. These would include:\nSee Take Over the City for a more modest version. A Villain World is a situation where this actually happened (for absence of a hero or some other incident that granted the bad guys absolute power) but a hero emerges and begins to undo the damage from the inside. For the opposite, see Save the World.\n"}
{"BulletHell": "Bullet Hell (called danmaku, meaning \"barrage\", in Japanese, literally \"bullet curtain\" when translated to English) shooters are a subgenre of Shoot Em Ups that test both your dodging skills and your resistance to seizures. To put it simply, they're (usually vertically-scrolling) shooters where all the enemies have lotsa dakka. They often feature extremely elaborate and beautiful patterns of bullet flows, especially for bosses, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of bullets on the screen at once, requiring constant weaving and pattern memorization in order to get the elusive S++ ranks. Not so painfully slow when they cover the screen, eh, tough guy? These games also tend to have True Final Bosses.\nHowever, the genre is not always as Nintendo Hard as it seems. The player's hitbox is often very small, sometimes only one pixel. In addition, the majority of enemy bullets are sprayed wildly and are not actually aimed at the player. Finally, the player is almost always given some variant of the Smart Bomb, which will remove bullets from the screen. Most modern bullet hell games give the player another way to avoid being killed, such as hypers in DoDonPachi, Touhou's deathbombs, or Giga Wing's Attack Reflector. Though by no means easy, a bullet hell game can be cleared without memorizing patterns or continuing. In fact, Bullet Hell games tend to be just as surmountable as older, less bullet-intensive games. It should be noted that if you do happen to come across an actual arcade Bullet Hell game, you will know that bullet-intensive areas tend to make the bullets slower. This is because the hardware used to create the bullets is slowing down, and can't process them all at the same time, and modern ones used to create even recent games like the DonPachi series have hardware comparable to that of home consoles. Again, that's a lot of dakka.\nIn addition, the bullet patterns are not the only elaborate things in these games. The scoring systems often require as much dedication to master as the bullet patterns. Some common elements including \"grazing\" (where a bullet passes through your character sprite but not your vital hitbox), collecting items dropped by enemies, and not dying. Like the bullet patterns, the scoring systems have become more complex as time went on, going from a very simple Combos based scoring system in DonPachi to systems that take multiple pages just to describe the most basic elements like Hellsinker. The scores attained have also been subject to inflation.\nThe types of projectiles fired by enemies and bosses will almost always be colourful Energy Balls to make it easier to tell them from the background, and so you can distinguish them from your own bullets.\nCan (and often does) overlap with Cute 'em Up. Usually unrelated to Platform Hell - most of these games are consistent about following their own rules and don't depend on cruel surprises.\nPlease note that this trope is for games where there are a remarkably high number of bullets on the screen. It is not a catch-all term for the shoot-em-up genre, although most Bullet Hells are super-classed as shoot-em-ups, and just because a shmup is Nintendo Hard does NOT mean it is a Bullet Hell game. A rule of thumb is: if you can count exactly how many bullets there are from just a quick glance of the screen, it most likely isn't one. By the same token, a Bullet Hell game doesn't have to be Nintendo Hard, though most of them are.\n"}
{"MalfunctionMalady": "Being sick is no fun for anyone. There's the fever, the aches and pains, the need to sleep, the runny nose, and a plethora of other unpleasant symptoms to contend with.\nFor magical or powered characters in fiction, particularly in animation, the above can come along with a Malfunction Malady. Regular symptoms of the common cold or other condition may be compounded by Power Incontinence, or a form of it. Powered characters who come down sick may find their powers firing off uncontrollably with every sneeze.\nWorse, when they attempt to use their powers intentionally, the result is a Magic Misfire - the effect they wanted affects the wrong target, inflicts a bizarre effect on some innocent bystander, fizzles, doesn't happen at all, or comes out completely random. Naturally, Hilarity Ensues.\nWorse yet, sometimes the effects are caused by something perfectly natural, like puberty or pregnancy.\nIf this wasn't all bad enough, there is almost never an easy cure. Usually the hapless victim of the malady wonking their powers has to wait it out, or their friends and teammates have to go on a Fetch Quest for some strange, arcane, rare or mysterious item (perhaps a Flower from the Mountaintop) to get them over this disease and its dangerous side effects.\nUse of this trope also tends to generate an Annoying Patient for any friend or family member nearby who isn't also sick or compromised by the sickness.\nSee also: Plot Allergy and Hiccup Hijinks.\n"}
{"BridgeBunnies": "Someone other than The Captain needs to actually run the Cool Starship, which is where the Bridge Bunnies come in. They're a few young, attractive twentysomething women (see Office Lady) who practically live on The Bridge, and deal with opening hailing frequencies, giving orders to the pilots of the Humongous Mecha squadrons, reporting that the Readings Are Off the Scale, activating the Applied Phlebotinum, repeating whatever the computer is saying, warning of Negative Space Wedgies, and the like. A staple of Japanese anime shows that feature large capital ships\u2014technically, said shows will usually include male personnel on the bridge, but the bunnies are much more likely to get names (and fans), unless said others are genuine characters and not scenery (as mentioned below).\nOff duty, they're frequently romantically paired with minor characters, or can be the Girl of the Week. They're invariably female, although a token male junior bridge officer may be sufficiently intimidated by them to serve as Comic Relief. Token males in this position will also likely be swinging their bat the other way, unless someone else on the crew fills that role. Depending on the protagonist's role on the ship, Those Two Guys may also work on the bridge with the Bunnies.\nLess common in Western shows these days, where bridge personnel are more likely to be competent professional officers of both sexes. Women on the bridge aren't necessarily Bridge Bunnies per se, nor are junior officers doing menial jobs... but a bridge full of young, pretty female junior officers, and on which all of the senior officers with real authority are male, is a textbook example of the trope (compare Office Lady). Go back far enough, and most western shows will completely lack any sort of female bridge personnel (their inclusion was considered very radical in the original Star Trek) with the understanding of naval warships being an inherently manly profession (look at any major warship on either side of the the classic Star Wars films).\nA specialized version of Mission Control, with all the twists therein possibly applicable. They occasionally serve as Those Two Girls, commenting on the action and what's going to happen next.\nNot to be confused with badge bunnies.\n"}
{"ArsonMurderandJaywalking": "When listing three or more things, the comedy rule is to not finish strong, but to list some strong examples followed by a very weak example, for the funny. Sometimes this will stick to the Rule of Three, but sometimes a longer list will increase the humor.\nIn the US and Canada, \"jaywalking\" means crossing the road in a dangerous manner, particularly ignoring the crosswalks when crossing city streets. In many other countries, not only are there almost no restrictions on where you can cross, but the idea of someone being fined for crossing the road is alien. In places where jaywalking is illegal, it's usually an infraction (i.e. like a parking ticket) rather than a proper criminal offense, and some cities don't even bother to enforce it.\nSee also: List of Transgressions, Arson, Murder, and Lifesaving, Felony Misdemeanor, Good News, Bad News, Odd Name Out, The Triple. Compare Poke the Poodle, All Crimes Are Equal, Jaywalking Will Ruin Your Life, when the minor crime carries significant consequences. The inverse is Bread, Eggs, Milk, Squick, where a list of seemingly mundane things ends with something much darker. Clue, Evidence, and a Smoking Gun is a related inverse that deals with deductions rather than listing things. Sub-Trope of The Last of These Is Not Like the Others.\n"}
{"CastFromStamina": "Stamina is usually used for physical activities. However, in some settings, it also fuels spells.\nIf there are other systems of magic in the setting, casting from Stamina usually has these characteristics:\nOften overlaps with Cast from Calories; Expect this kind of mage to be a Big Eater.\nAs a consequence of Stamina being a vital spellcasting stat rather than a Dump Stat, Magic users in this paradigm tends to be much buffer than your average Squishy Wizard.\nCompare and contrast with Cast from Hit Points, which wounds the character, may be lethal if done to excess, and is usually associated with Blood Magic and The Dark Arts - but which is generally more powerful than casting from stamina or mana, due to the higher risk involved. Many works include both, though, Cast from Hit Points being the Dangerous Forbidden Technique version.\n Literature\n Live Action TV\n Tabletop Games\n Video Games\n Web Original\n"}
{"WrittenByTheVictors": "When the official history of the setting is overwritten by the ones in power and their Propaganda Machine. As such the real heroes and good guys are given Historical Villain Upgrade, the bad guys build a Cult of Personality around their actions and all the bad sides of the past is submitted to a Rose Tinted Narrative.\nIn Real Life and actual history, it is certainly true that historical accounts can be subject to the personal bias of the writer and readers have to be wary of them, which is what the saying warns us about. However, applying the saying in such a simplistic manner can potentially be as reductive, misleading, and more importantly just as binary as \"the winners' narrative\". To say that history is written by the winners should mean that we should treat both the winners and losers fairly and not present a one-sided view. Academic historians would qualify this by stating that our knowledge about our past, certain figures and events, is based only on a few sources and furthermore, our understanding of history is never static and unchanging. History is, in truth, written and rewritten by all sorts of people with different agendas. Historiography is a separate discipline that actually studies and keeps track of how people's opinions about the past and certain events change throughout history. The reason for those changes is that people who win in one era, would lose in the other and their conquerors will be as generous to the defeated as they were to their defeated. Likewise, \"winners\" and \"losers\" mean a variety of things. In the military-political sense, losers at times do end up writing history; since they've often been deprived of actual power after their defeat, they often spend their time sulking and writing about how things would have been so much better had they won - just ask a Neo-Nazi or a Confederate apologist. The \"real\" actual and potential losers in this situation would be in the racial-economical sense, (African-Americans, Jews, LGBT and other minorities).\nAlso worth pointing out that not every \"winner\" is going to be slick and sly about their crimes, simply because they don't view them as crimes. Many of history's \"winners\" will be surprisingly honest about atrocities or even write proudly of how they brutally crushed their opponents, because it would serve their self-interest and their careerist aspirations. For example, Caesar wrote of his borderline genocide of the Gauls in his personal memoirs, and historians doubt that account and other Roman accounts only because they feel Caesar is exaggerating, not only his actions but also those of his enemies, since Romans always did like painting its wars as \"defensive\" and their victories as underdog triumphs, so historians are skeptical about the moments when Romans invoke Worthy Opponent on their enemies as well. It likewise appealed to the vanity and pride of an Empire to preserve trophies and symbols of their conquest of foreign peoples, after all if the winner is writing a history, they would need losers to make themselves and their achievements look special. You can't be a King without a Kingdom and a People to rule over, so in every work of propaganda there are, for lack of a better term, Freudian Slip and other bits and moments that actually do allow the multitude to peep over the shoulder of their rulers. It's also worth pointing out the most obvious fact that even people on the same side will often disagree wildly on events and motivations.\nThis is also connected with Grey and Gray Morality and Morality Kitchen Sink in that picking one side of the story over the other in this context does not necessarily make it correct. After all, Your Terrorists Are Our Freedom Fighters.\nNote that if the historical dispute already exists its use may become controversial at worst, or people may feel there is a Writer on Board at best. And if it doesn't, people may not take it seriously, and think that Beethoven Was an Alien Spy is at play instead (disputing historical accounts is the task of historians, not authors of works of fiction). The usual way to deal with this is to apply the trope to completely fictional history, where both the official and disputed events are fictional to begin with. Such as the exploits of the national hero of a fictional country, or a Empire with a Dark Secret. The usual way is to provide a recap of the official history, have the hero find out the real and darker history, and start a conflict between him and the figures in power that may be in problem if the actual history comes to light. There are three possible outcomes. One, The Bad Guy Wins and official history stays. Two, the actual history comes to light, and Nothing Is the Same Anymore. Third, the hero realizes the scope of the changes that would take place and decides that it's not worth it; for good or evil, history has already happened a long time ago, and its discussion should be merely academic.\nA prime belief of every Conspiracy Theorist. Sub-trope of Might Makes Right. Supertrope of Internal Retcon and Pop-Cultural Osmosis and Hollywood History. Contrast You Cannot Kill An Idea.\n"}
{"WoundedGazelleWarcry": "The role of the helpless innocent victim is hard to combine with taking drastic action yourself. But it can be the perfect role if your goal is to let others take action: Your plight may give them the adrenaline rush, social justification, or whatever they need to take action and strike down your foes.\nThus, you can use your (real or more-or-less-pretended) victimhood to your own advantage, and to the advantage of the people who you rally to your aid.\nCompare and contrast Wounded Gazelle Gambit: The similarity is that in both tropes, a person uses the role of victimhood to his or her own advantage. The difference is that in the gambit they're manipulating someone to take their side (which may or may not be for the benefit of the manipulated \u2014 usually not), while in this trope they're empowering a person or group for their mutual benefit. Also, the gambit always uses a false victimhood, while the warcry does not have to contain any deceit. On the contrary, a real plight is a better weapon than a pretended one. However, the character might blur the line between self-sacrifice and victimhood, putting themself in harm's way so their allies can get the chance to rescue them or avenge them. If such a step is taken for nothing, it might make them a Martyr Without a Cause.\nDepending on the setting, this warcry either can be used by individuals and groups regardless of gender or it is restricted to Always Female. Or it's somewhere in between. In a patriarchal (male-dominated) society, it becomes easier for women to use this warcry while making it harder for them to wield power in other ways. In a setting where Men Are the Expendable Gender, it's very hard for a man to use this warcry.\n"}
{"BlackMage": "These mages are all about attacking with spells and doing lots of damage with them. Typically these mages will be users of most if not all types of Elemental Powers (one element is not unheard of, though), with Fire, Ice, Lightning being particularly common, and may fall under Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards. They do not heal (or only have minor healing spells) and typically pack Area of Effect spells in their arsenal.\nVery frequently Dark Is Not Evil.\nThe term comes from JRPGs, particularly the Final Fantasy series, and is in stark contrast with its meaning in European tradition which is \"a user of evil magic\".\nBlack Magician Girl and Lady of Black Magic are subtropes and are often paired up with The Medic, White Mage, or White Magician Girl as a Foil. Specifically paired with a White Mage it's Black and White Magic.\nOften overlaps with Squishy Wizard and Glass Cannon. Contrast The Medic and White Mage (the defensive or remedial equivalent).\nNot to be confused with Black Magic (which is outright evil rather than merely destructive) or the character Black Mage Evilwizardington (though he is an example of both tropes).\n"}
{"PowerOfRock": "Describe The Power Of Rock Here, and THROW UP THE HORNS!!!\nIn which the world is saved and the Big Bad defeated, not through The Power of Love or The Power of Friendship, but through ROCK!!!\nYes, for some reason, music is the most capable form of creative expression when it comes to defeating the forces of evil. The battle often takes the form of a rock concert or music video. That in itself helps to explain why it's almost always music that saves the world. It'd take a very imaginative writer/director to defeat the villain with the power of Symbolism, also known as Modern Expressionism.\nIncidentally, it's only \"The Power of Rock\" because 99 percent of the time rock is the musical genre of choice for this trope. Rock tends to be loud and theatrical, and therefore more powerful. As the examples below show, other kinds of music work too.\nCan also refer to the many, many works of fiction in which characters fight for their right to rock (or party, or dance, or whatever as long as it involves music). Expect any video game involving musicians to have the \"rocking heroes fight Culture Police\" plot.\nSeen quite a lot in shows that feature a literal Five-Man Band or a Fake Band, and associated performances. The weapon of choice of The Rock Star when he goes adventuring.\nNote: Not to be confused with Musical Assassin. This trope involves actual music playing that the audience can appreciate, not just characters playing instruments with the sonic power to kick ass. There are few game examples of The Power Of Rock outside of music-based games.\nA form of Magic Music or Disco Tech.\nCompare Loud of War, Care-Bear Stare, The Power of Love, The Power of Friendship, Autobots, Rock Out!, A Little Something We Call \"Rock and Roll\", Great Balls of Fire, Brown Note, Rock Me, Asmodeus!, Make Me Wanna Shout, Clap Your Hands If You Believe, Awesome Music.

And to make things worse, all the heroes have been wounded and are unable to fight... except for John Q.

This can be done with a single character who lends him a weapon, in which case it is usually The Rival.

{"JeanneDarchetype": "Jeanne d'Arch\u00e9type is a fictional character inspired by Saint Joan of Arc.note\u00a0Spelled \"Jeanne d'Arc\" in her native French, if you couldn't figure it out. This can incorporate various elements of the historical Joan's story. This character is Always Female, usually young, often an Action Girl, and often of humble origin. Her devotion to a religion, her country, or simply a desire to protect her loved ones causes her to assume an active role in liberating the oppressed from an overbearing force, eventually becoming not only a respected leader, but also a living symbol and a reminder of just how unjust the oppressors are if they bring out the warrior in the most unlikely of people. Therefore, her example directly inspires many otherwise ordinary people to follow in her footsteps and join the same cause.\nRealizing her importance, it is highly likely her enemies will eventually exploit her own Honor Before Reason to lure her into a trap and subject to a public trial and execution. This, of course, is bound to backfire, as even past her untimely death, her movement will live on as her martyrdom drives them to more zealous and inspirational levels up to veneration as a larger-than-life Divine Figure, sometimes complete with the title \"Saint\" or any other equivalent.\nShe may also crossdress, experience supernatural voices or visions, be chaste or celibate, wear heavy armor, be a farm girl, join the military, or be persecuted and martyred. Extra points for suffering a Cruel and Unusual Death such as being burned at the stake. (Especially if even that involves voluntary martyrdom.)\nMay also overlap with Sweet Polly Oliver, Lady of War, or Church Militant.\nA subtrope of Magnetic Hero. Compare & contrast Messianic Archetype, Young Conqueror, A Child Shall Lead Them.\n"}
{"SuperheroesStaySingle": "It used to be thought that superheroes had to be single in order to be interesting protagonists. After all, a single superhero is a mobile superhero; it's easier to suddenly drop everything to go fly into space and have adventures with the Space Princess of Neptune when you don't have a wife and kids waiting at home. And besides that, everybody knows that comic book readers are lonely, single guys anyway. So why bother them with something they can't relate to, like a committed relationship?\nAs such, superheroes afflicted with this trope are never, under any circumstances, allowed to settle down with anyone. (At least, not in the main canon.) Unlike the Celibate Hero, they may actually date, but expect them to say \"It's Not You, It's My Enemies,\" and other excuses of varying plausibility. If they actually do show signs of planning to settle down with someone, expect the Cartwright Curse to rear its ugly head, resulting in the love interest getting killed off, Put on a Bus or otherwise removed from the hero's life before story's end or somewhere further down the line.\nCompare Cartwright Curse, True Love Is Boring, and Shipping Bed Death, which may lead to this in more romance-focused works such as Lois & Clark.\nRelated to The Masquerade Will Kill Your Dating Life.\n"}
{"UndeadLaborers": "When someone uses The Undead, such as zombies and reanimated corpses, as a cheap labor force for simple but time-consuming tasks, such as mining. The \"employer\" of this undead workforce may be a living individual (most likely a Necromancer of some sort) or a likewise undead creature\u2014but of a much more powerful and intelligent variety. From a business perspective, using undead workers is a very cost-efficient strategy: zombies and skeletons don't need to sleep or eat, never get sick, and are unlikely to spontaneously form undead trade unions due to lacking free will. As such, it is one of the least morally objectionable ways to use Human Resources, although it always depends on where exactly the dead are coming from.\nA Voodoo Zombie is traditionally employed as a worker, almost to the point of being a specific subtrope of this. Compare Night of the Living Mooks, where disposable undead are instead used for battle. The Necrocracy is the opposite, where the ruling class are undead because it confers them advantages over the living, while the lower classes are mortals subjugated by fear or the promise of immortality (though simple-minded undead thralls may also exist in such societies, and becoming one would be a Fate Worse than Death).\nFor a realistic and/or science fiction take on the subject, compare Job-Stealing Robot.\n"}
{"CharacterClass": "A type of Game System where a character's abilities are determined by the class that they choose. Most common in Role-Playing Games, but recently it has begun appearing in other genres, particularly First Person Shooters and it's one of the main features of the subgenre Hero Shooter. A character class is defined by the abilities that it lends to a character \u2014 as such, two different characters of the same class are theoretically interchangeable, in that they can play the same role in the game because of their similar abilities. However, character class systems have varying levels of Character Customization \u2014 ranging from characters of a given class being literally identical to having so much variety that character class is no longer even a good indicator of that character's abilities. Character class systems frequently include one or more Point Build Systems as part of their rules to increase customizability.\nOne of the major differences between these systems (besides the classes that they offer) is how they handle \"multiclassing\". Because classes determine a character's abilities, giving a character multiple classes is a good way to expand their abilities, but the extent to which this is possible differs greatly. Sometimes classes are completely mutually exclusive, and a character is stuck with whatever class they have until they die. Sometimes they can \"upgrade\" their class at a certain point, either plot-based or level-based \u2014 this upgrade may be linear (eg, a Squire becomes a Knight) or may allow for a branching path to different Prestige Classes (eg, a Knight can upgrade to The Paladin or a Black Knight, but not both). Some systems are more lenient about multiclassing, allowing characters to change classes whenever they want; however, these systems build in drawbacks as well. Usually, either you can only be one class at a time (eg, if you change classes from Knight to Mage, you lose all Knight abilities and gain all Mage abilities), or you can only advance one class at a time (eg, if you're a Knight/Mage, you have to choose whether to increase your combat skills as a Knight or your casting skills as a Mage; you can't do both at once). Both approaches have the advantage of increased versatility (a larger number of abilities) at the price of decreased potency (each individual ability is less powerful).\nIn RPGs, the most common type is the Class and Level System. See also Fighter, Mage, Thief for a common set of 3 types of classes seen in RPG class systems. However, many FPSes that feature classes don't have levels, relying instead on player skill. See Common Character Classes for a list of classes that frequently turn up in games with character class systems, and Modern Day & Sci-Fi RPG Class Equivalents for their counterparts outside of the classic Heroic Fantasy settings. See Point Build System for the main alternative to this (although, as mentioned, the two can be combined).\nIf a character can switch between a large number of classes instead of being limited to just one or several, then you most likely have a Job System on your hands.\n"}
{"JackofAllTrades": "Specialization is a common trend in fiction. It allows the author to create an ensemble cast where every member of a team provides a specific function, and avoids role duplication. This character says \"specialization is for insects!\"\nPerhaps a character is a loner, and needs to be able to do everything on his own. Perhaps everyone else is so useless, he had to take over their jobs as well as his own. Perhaps he just has a wide variety of interests. May be a sign of a person with a checkered past, who has had to take on a lot of roles in his life, just to get by. Whatever the reason, this character has at least some skill in a wide variety of disciplines.\nSometimes The Leader of a team may be a Jack-Of-All-Trades, with a good, basic grasp of the specialized skills possessed by the members of his team, allowing him to understand how to use each team member to their fullest potential.\nFrom an analysis standpoint it could be argued that being good at everything is a form of specialization. While a jack-of-all character might not stand out, they are usually well equipped to handle most situations and most opponents. It's their well-rounded nature that makes them so versatile allowing them to deal with almost anything or sub in for anyone at the last second. What if the opponent is really strong but not very fast? The jack of all can out pace them while being strong enough to do damage. What if the opponent is faster? Usually the jack-of-all is fast enough to defend against if not avoid their opponent's attacks and deal out more punishment in a war of attrition.\nSupertrope of Renaissance Man (where someone is exceptionally good at many things) and Master of None (where someone does poorly at a lot of things). A related trope found in Video Games and Tabletop Games is the Jack-of-All-Stats, who has well-balanced stats, not skills. See also The Red Mage, Renaissance Man and Power Copying. Do-Anything Robot may be a justification for this. Compare the Master of All, who is the best (or among the best) in practically everything.

{"RestrictedExpandedUniverse": "Popular series often get adapted into other media than the original \u2014 novels or comic books, for instance, made of movies or TV shows. But there's no way Luke Skywalker's going to get killed off in the Star Wars comic; note\u00a0while he dies early on in the Star Wars Infinities version of The Empire Strikes Back, that's an Alternate Universe; he's eventually shown dying of old age in the prime timeline generally, licensed alternative media can't kill characters, develop relationships, alter the world, or make any sort of changes that have a chance of messing up the continuity for the original version.\nThese alternate media therefore can end up running in place and be inferior to the original because of the lack of change. Sometimes new characters to which change can happen are introduced to make up for the problem.\nMay be avoided if the original series is over. The newer Buffy the Vampire Slayer comics not only can change the status quo, but are written by the series creator. . A similar thing is likely to happen to the Star Wars continuity, now that new films have been announced\u2014indeed, the old Expanded Universe is now an Alternate Continuity known as Star Wars Legends, but its elements are available to authors to re-canonize.\nA variation of this happens in anime with Filler, which the Shounen commercial juggernauts are infamous for. The non-filler episodes are adapted from the source material, usually a manga, and are part of an overarching plot; the filler episodes are made for the animation, and must leave everything as it was before at the end of the filler.\nThis trope only applies if the spin-off is meant to follow the same continuity as the original series (though not necessarily vice versa). It doesn't apply to adaptations that are retelling the story, and may feel free to change things as needed. A result of this is that other media originating from a film or television show (which are by far spin-offs and expansions) are much more faithful than films or television taking from another source (which are usually adaptations of the same story).\nSee also Status Quo Is God and Doomed by Canon. Compare Fan Work Ban.\n"}
{"TheSparkOfGenius": "Sometimes known as \"Super Science\" or mad science, it looks like science, but on a fundamental level it works opposite to regular science.\nIn most settings, science is a skill that any intelligent person can learn, while magic is a supernatural ability restricted to certain gifted individuals. In other settings, \"The Spark Of Genius\" is an innate talent belonging to a unique few, much like magic or superpowers in other settings.\nOne key difference between normal science and the spark is that, in the former, a scientific experiment can (at least in theory) be reproduced by anyone, while the latter only works because the unique gifts of certain individuals make it happen.\nIn extreme cases, one without the spark cannot do what a gifted scientist can; even if they built a copy from the original blueprints it just wouldn't work for anyone without the spark. Perhaps because those with the spark are Reality Warpers who make their inventions possible. Naturally between non-reproducible results and the spark belonging to an elite few, this is entirely incompatible with the scientific method.\nIn other cases, a sufficiently Badass Normal scientist could match someone with the spark, in which case the contrast may be one of Technician vs. Performer or Hard Work Hardly Works. However, in works where this trope applies, sufficiently skilled scientists are often much rarer than people who have the spark. While it doesn't automatically conflict with the scientific method, in many works, those with the spark are Mad Scientists and don't often demonstrate scientific rigor. Their toys can be copied exactly, but underlying principles are hard to reuse \u2014 these people run on \"either you get it or you don't\", without stopping to back up their demonstrable results with a good theory, or unable to explain the ideas they use when they want.\nCommon in Steam Punk. In some settings often or always combined with Science-Related Memetic Disorder or other science madness.\nCompare Fantastic Science, which inverts this trope by making magic work like science rather then the other way around. Also compare For Science!, Weird Science, and Emperor Scientist. The products of The Spark of Genius are frequently examples of Magic-Powered Pseudoscience.\n"}
{"TheGameOfTheBook": "Video Games are a medium that can easily be adapted from a book or comic series. Typically, to gain a mainstream audience a book is adapted into a movie.

{"IceMagicIsWater": "Ice and Water are two very common elemental properties to give characters in works of fiction. However, perhaps more than any other two pairs of elements, they are very close. After all, ice is merely frozen water, and thawing it out will make your ice attack a water attack.\nThus, some works portray ice and water as the same element. A character's element may be said to be water, but they will still have command over ice. In video game terms, ice and water-based attacks may be considered the same for purposes of Elemental Rock\u2013Paper\u2013Scissors. Other titles may play with this idea to various ends.\n"}

You just got volunteered!\nThere are lots of different versions of this:\nHowever it happens, the unwilling volunteer agrees to do it anyways. Maybe because he's just too nice a guy to say no. Maybe he doesn't want to leave people in the lurch. Maybe he really doesn't want to cross the boss\u2014and sometimes, there's a really good reason not to. Or maybe he just doesn't want to be labeled a coward.\nUsually played as comedy, although occasionally it's played for drama.\nCommonly volunteered in this way: Boxed Crooks, Condemned Contestant, The Bait, and Cincinnatus.\nThe opposite of Martyr Without a Cause. If it's the Call to Adventure, then the protagonist never got a chance at Refusal of the Call because other people accepted it for him.\n"}
{"SignOfTheApocalypse": "\n\n\nA Stock Phrase when something particularly unexpected happens, usually following O.O.C. Is Serious Business. For instance, \"Alice just spoke, does anyone see four horsemen riding up?\"\nIf it's someone saying the end is nigh if this thing happens, and then it does, see Cue the Flying Pigs. Often used to lampshade Dumbass Has a Point. For extra humor, someone with a sign may show up to declare The End Is Nigh.\nNot to be confused with Signs of the End Times, which is when you're literally seeing signs of the apocalypse. Or someone carrying a sign that says The End Is Nigh.\n"}
{"BadassLabcoat": "A Longcoat is the ideal action-hero garment, more practical than a cape but infinitely cooler than a sport coat or no coat. In addition, a Longcoat of any level of 'billowy-ness' makes an ideal cover for producing any number of weapons, tools, supplies and whatnot. Certain styles of Longcoat are deliberately designed to distort the wearer's frame, making their wearer's access to Hammerspace almost believable to mundane eyes. This distortion of the wearer's real shape also makes it genuinely harder to land an accurate attack on them.\nLike capes, longcoats capitalize on the dramatic effect of having something that flutters behind you. A variant involves jackets and excessively long shirts, but having less material to billow in the gusts necessarily makes such people seem less badass. And of course, when the wearer of a Badass Longcoat takes the coat off, it's a sign that he's about to do some major damage - he just doesn't want to get your blood on his coat. Additionally, a longcoat in fiction is almost never worn closed, and many are cut in such a way that closing them is actually impossible, giving the illusion of a broader chest and more masculine figure.\nThe most common types of long coats are dusters\u25ca and trench coats\u25ca, and frock coats\u25ca.\nDusters are longer overall, usually reaching nearly to the ankles. Since they're designed for horseback riding, they have a long slit up the back as far as the waist, and optional leg straps so they don't billow too much in the wind or while riding. Dusters are also generally cut along fairly boxy lines.\nA trench coat, on the other hand, is usually more shaped, reaches to the knees or slightly below and the back slit generally only reaches mid-thigh or hip-level. Trench coats also usually feature a belt and epaulets. It should be noted that one way to tell if a trench coat indicates a spy or private investigator or is a Badass Longcoat is by whether it's buttoned and belted or not. A Badass Trenchcoat is never closed (unless it's on Humphrey Bogart).\nAn older variant of the trenchcoat is the greatcoat, a predecessor of the trench coat but usually much heavier, and with either a wider collar that can be turned up to protect against the wind or a short shoulder cape. Later greatcoats lost the cape, becoming a longer, heavier, double breasted overcoat, but retaining the name. Greatcoats were typically worn either buttoned, losing some of their badassitude for style, or simply draped over the shoulders without putting the arms into the sleeves, greatly increasing their badassitude. They're most often associated with 19th Century naval officers, Nazi SS officers, and Russian soldiers.\nThe Inverness cape\u25ca is a lighter garment with a very similar appearance to the caped greatcoat. The cape, however, is longer, reaching slightly past the wrist rather than only to the elbow, and an Inverness cape has no sleeves at all.\nFrock coats, in contrast to all of the above coats, are very exquisitely tailored coats usually made of wool, like a longer version of a sport coat, but much more formal. Variants also include, on occasion, materials such as leather and, depending on the time in which the piece takes place, even silk. As they are one of the most enduring and ubiversal fashions in the history of mens' clothing, they have many different variations in cut ranging from the square-cut military frock coats\u25ca of the 1600s to the cutaway-style frocks\u25ca of the mid-to-late 1700s, to the, again, square coats that every Victorian and Edwardian aristocrat can be seen wearing in all of your favorite period dramas. In all of these cases, the coat is not intended to be closed \u2014 most of the time they don't actually have buttonholes \u2014 although from the later 1790s through to around the 1870s, and later on in the 1920s, they could be worn either way. If you're watching a period piece from the 1600s to the start of World War II, chances are most, if not all, of your male characters are wearing some kind of frock coat.\nPlease note that they are absolutely not in any way overcoats.\nBeing that they are tailored, with pleated tails that reach down to around the knees and pleated vents that invariably end right at the waist (beneath two buttons sewn in for decoration), frock coats have a tendency to sway and billow as one walks or stands facing the wind, without the heaviness or general shapelessness of leather or canvas, which are the two materials that most trenchcoats, greatcoats, and dusters are made from.\nMoby-Dick features the \"long-togged Scaramouche\" (an evangelical preacher who has gained moral ascendancy over his crew mates) and Oliver Twist has The Artful Dodger, making this at least Older Than Radio.\nGoing back even further is a coat called a justaucorps\u25ca (essentially the long coats of the 17th and 18th centuries; think Pirates of the Caribbean) though it has to be worn a certain way to pull off the badass look.\nA less modern example would be the Badass Long Robe. Cool Shades are a nice accessory, as are tacking on a Nice Hat and Cool Mask to achieve the Coat, Hat, Mask Effect. If the mask in question is a gas mask, then it's Gas Mask, Longcoat. The Badass Longcoat is often combined with a pair of guns, either revolvers for a western or a pair of semiautomatic pistols or submachine guns in the modern day and beyond, for extra effect. Some characters will pack enough weapons in their longcoats to outfit a small army.\nLongcoat-wearing heroes probably started with Westerns (for dusters) or Film Noir (for the classic trenchcoat), but became especially common in the public mind after The Matrix.\nThe Badass Longcoat is closely associated with Those Wacky Nazis (since Germans in war have been associated with wearing leather longcoats), The Stoic and the Trenchcoat Brigade. Compare Badass in a Nice Suit, and contrast Not-So-Badass Longcoat. Not related to Badass Longcat. Not to be confused with Conspicuous Trenchcoat, a specific type of coat that is also long, or Coat Cape, where a coat is worn over the shoulder like a cape for what is often a similar visual effect.\n(Please note that this trope is about the coat, not the person. Please include information about the coat when adding examples, rather than simply listing a character. The coat is important.)\n"}
{"SidequestSidestory": "In a typical RPG videogame, it's basic practice to stuff a few fetch quests and collectable hunts in to beef up the play time. Some games go the extra mile, and make these sidequests string together to tell the backstories and continuing tales of the NPCs around you. For example, a sidequest could be to fetch a poison sword for someone to help them win an upcoming duel, and a follow-up quest deals with everybody calling that person a cheat for using poison and ostracizing them (real example from Xenoblade). Done well, this can lead to the feeling of playing within a living, breathing game world.\nSee also Chain of Deals. Closely related to Match Maker Quest, which focuses entirely on love and NPC coupling.\n"}
{"IAmDyingPleaseTakeMyMacGuffin": "\n\n\nA minor character has an important MacGuffin or other Plot Device, but has been fatally wounded, or is otherwise about to die. This character then hands the object over to the main character(s) before dying. The main character(s) continue the dead person's mission to get the thing to wherever it's supposed to get to before the bad guys get it.\nA good way to keep the true story a mystery (and to keep the audience interested) is to have the main character be an Unlikely Hero that has NO idea what's going on or who to trust.\nThe old bearer may double as a Sacrificial Lamb, and is quite often a Pursued Protagonist. Despite the trope name, the object handed over might or might not be a MacGuffin.\nCompare with It May Help You on Your Quest, Plot Coupon, and MacGuffin Escort Mission. See also Almost Dead Guy, who passes on information instead of plot coupons, and Bequeathed Power, when the thing being passed on is some kind of superpower rather than an item. For when the transaction involves human beings, see Take Care of the Kids.\nMay be a Harbinger of Impending Doom. Contrast Come with Me If You Want to Live.\nSub-Trope of Take Up My Sword, itself a Sub-Trope of Herald. Compare The Chooser of The One.\n"}
{"Berserker": "The Berserker is a character who throws himself into a fight with such reckless abandon, it seems like he wants to die. It could be over-enthusiasm, overconfidence, Unstoppable Rage, or the desire to die (in battle). Whatever the cause, it's usually accompanied by a bellowing warcry. Sometimes with total obliviousness to whether he's actually fighting the enemy. And he never, ever retreats.\nFor extra points of terrifying spectacle, oftentimes the Berserker is inexplicably immune to pain and/or injury. It's one thing for the screaming, frothing lunatic hacking people down left and right to simply be too savage to get near, but when they take so many arrows they look like a porcupine and it just pisses them off even more it is quite another. When they shrug off a cannonball with little more than a feral scream, that's usually sufficient for the opposing army to collectively shit itself and run.\nBerserkers are equally capable of being good or evil. If they're good, then out of battle, they will likely brood about whatever it is that causes their berserk fits or remorse about losing control of themselves. Most end up one of two ways: being taught by their teammates to control themselves after a particularly close call, or dying in a dramatic fashion while lamenting that they died without completing their mission. Good Berserkers are also very prone to Heroic Sacrifices, for very obvious reasons. When this is not played for drama, the Berserker may have a Boisterous Bruiser attitude when not in his battle rage. An evil Berserker, on the other hand, is generally just unrepentantly Ax-Crazy and very often Chaotic Evil.\nThe trope's title refers to the berserkr of Viking-age Scandinavia: Warriors who are said to have thrown themselves into battle wearing only animal hides for armour and with no regard for their own safety. Their 'battle-madness', whose exact nature is presently unknown (some say it came from eating weird mushrooms before a battle) is said to have been a gift from Odin. The word \"berserkr\" means \"Bear-shirt\" in Old Norse, referring to either their going into battle with the ferocity of bears or for wearing bear pelts into battle. Their effectiveness in battle is up for debate, but they were an imposing and terrifying nightmare to the continental Europeans \u2014 and, if The Icelandic Sagas are to be trusted, to their own civilization. Some Norse societies would eventually outright ban the practices of the berserker, no doubt influenced by its people converting to Christianity.\nWith terms in sources speaking of the Norse berserkr also occasionally giving off some implication of Shapeshifting (or at least stating their ferocity was like they became savage animals...), it's a possibility the tales of the berserker would later inspire that of the Werewolf.\nBerserkers that truly do wish to die in battle are better known as Death Seekers \u2014 those who don't often overlap with the Blood Knight or Barbarian Hero instead. When foolishly done without any regard to strategy or planning, the Berserker becomes a Leeroy Jenkins. Because of its historical root, berserkers are likely part of a Proud Warrior Race.\nCompare Berserk Button, which is when pressing a character's Trigger turns them into this. Compare Hulking Out for cases where the berserk character changes physically as well as mentally. If the Berserker fights this hard so that no one else needs to help him, he might also a Martyr Without a Cause. Contrast Blinded by Rage, where a berserker's blind rage proves to be his undoing.\nThis trope should not be confused with the now-disbanded Australian grindcore band The Berzerker, the Berserker universe, the manga franchise Berserk, the classic arcade game Berzerk, or the 1967 B-horror movie Berserk.\n"}
{"Xianxia": "One of the oldest genres in Chinese literature, w\u01d4xi\u00e1 (\u6b66\u4fa0 \u2014 literally \"martial-arts chivalry\" or \"martial arts heroes\", and pronounced roughly woo-seeah in Mandarin) stories are tall tales of honourable warriors (\u4fa0 xi\u00e1) fighting against evil, whether it be an individual villain, or a corrupt government. Notable for melodrama, spectacular swordplay, and high-flying martial arts.\nAlthough some wuxia stories are set in modern times, or even the future, most take place in the \"Martial Arts World\" of Ji\u0101ngh\u00fa (\u6c5f\u6e56 \u2014 literally \"rivers and lakes\") a Fantasy Counterpart Culture of Imperial China. The Jianghu is a \"shared universe\", populated by martial-artists and monks, wandering knights and beautiful princesses, thieves and beggars, priests and healers, merchants and craftsmen. The best wuxia writers draw a vivid picture of the intricate relationships of honour, loyalty, love and hate between individuals and between communities in this milieu. It is implicit that law and government are unjust, ineffective and/or corrupt, requiring the xia to settle differences by force moderated only by their chivalrous code, and often forcing them to live as outlaws despite their noble characters. In modern Chinese, perhaps as a result of these connotations of a separate world with its own rules, the term jianghu has taken on other meanings, including the underworld or criminal gangs.\nA more romantic term known as Wulin (\u6b66\u6797 \u2014 literally \"Warrior's Forests\") is used when one wants to talk specifically about the world of martial artists and warriors specifically, divorced from the ugly connotations of criminality that jianghu has come to embody. Wulin is basically a majestic way of saying \"The World of Warriors.\"\nModern works often incorporate outside themes and ideas, allowing the genre to develop, and in turn w\u01d4xi\u00e1 themes and visual styles have strongly influenced Western media, especially in cinema. In a similiar vein to J. R. R. Tolkien and High Fantasy, Jin Yong, Gu Long, and Liang Yusheng proliferated the modern wuxia genre.\nIn recent years, a sub-genre known as Xianxia (\"Immortal Hero\") has developed. Essentially a High Fantasy version, it usually features a Taoist or Buddhist protagonist mixing in Full-Contact Magic with his martial arts, and fantastic elements being overt rather than subtle and in the background. It is an emerging genre whose precise boundaries are in flux, with a number of popular Web Serial Novels having brought it to prominence.\nCompare High Fantasy, Heroic Fantasy, and Swashbuckler. The Japanese equivalent is Jidai Geki, particularly the chanbara subgenre (Although interestingly, the term Wuxia was originally a calque of the Japanese Bukyo. In Japan, however, the term bukyo faded into obscurity). For the 2011 movie titled Wu Xia, see Swordsmen.\n"}
{"DerailedTrainOfThought": "When one character becomes so sidetracked by one train of thought that he completely forgets about the original topic.\nCharacters prone to this include the Cloud Cuckoo Lander and The Ditz. The Only Sane Man (who is often subject to this) can respond with a facepalm, some form of internal monologue expressing his disbelief, or an attempt to remind the invoker of this trope what they were talking about in the first place. Occasionally, the subject material brought up in the Derailed Train of Thought can result in the recipient receiving Too Much Information. Responses may include the Spit Take, and for added humor, the invoker of the Derailed Train of Thought may remain unaware of the reaction he/she has caused.\nSometimes, the invoker of this trope may not be a Cloud Cuckoo Lander, but is extremely embarrassed and, as such, wants to turn the subject to something different. Or it could be a Cloud Cuckoo Lander who also happens to be extremely embarrassed.\nCompare also with Non Sequitur, in which it is heavily implied that the character should be discussing one thing, but one of them goes completely against those expectations. In this trope, it is made clear by an initial statement what the conversation is about, and then one character turns the topic to something completely different. Observe:\nIn Non Sequitur (taken from their page):\nIn Derailed Train of Thought:\nNotice that in the second example, Alice specifically stated that they were going to talk about cell phones, whereas in the first, it was merely implied.\nRelated to Wiki Walk, Metaphorgotten and Sidetracked by the Analogy. Compare Seinfeldian Conversation in which the conversation is pointless but not necessarily unrelated.\n"}
{"TheyLookLikeEveryoneElse": "This is when a villain doesn't look like a villain, and is even more terrifying because of it. This does not apply to particularly handsome or charming villains - that goes under Evil Is Sexy or Face of an Angel, Mind of a Demon. Characters following this trope look completely ordinary. You could pass them on the street and never notice them, let alone suspect they murdered someone just the other day.\nIn fantasy and science fiction shows, this is often what makes Mundanger villains so terrifying. While the normal beasties the protagonists hunt down and slay are obviously fantastic monsters that don't exist in our world, these monsters could be living right next door.\nPlease note: The identity of many of these villains may be part of a reveal, so please use spoilers wisely.\nAn Enfant Terrible is usually one of these. Contrast Obviously Evil and Devil in Plain Sight, as well as Face of a Thug (when someone is good or well-adjusted despite having a thug face). Compare Manchurian Agent, where they genuinely are like everyone else until triggered. Related with but not to be confused for They Look Like Us Now, where previously inhuman beasties learn to pass for human. The Nondescript is when their \"normalness\" is taken so far that people can't even remember what they're like. May intersect with Ridiculously Average Guy, who looks and acts utterly normal in every respect.\nThe Trope Namer is a lazy Halloween costume: going in ordinary clothes to a costume party, then claiming, \"I'm a serial killer. They look just like everybody else.\"\nThis is Truth in Television. Who knows? Maybe one of the tropers could just be this.\n"}
{"CuteMonster": "And then there is another kind of monster. Maybe they're just a baby, and someday they'll grow up into one of the first types of monsters, but until then they're not so bad. Maybe they've discovered The Power of Friendship. Maybe they try to be evil, but they're not very good at it. Maybe in-universe they're horrifying, but the audience gets to see the softer side of them. But whatever the reason, these monsters aren't very monstrous. Simply put, they're adorable.\nRelated to Cute Monster Girl, but where those are generally cute in a sexualized way, these are generally cute in the sense of kittens, puppies and babies. Fanfic focused on cute monsters is generally less focused on relationships between them and humans than fanfic focused on Cute Monster Girls; sure, it happens sometimes, but not as often and when it does it's less supported by the Canon. If owned by one of the main characters may count as a Cool Pet. As mentioned above, some of these also count as Ridiculously Cute Critters, but these are all still monsters, and they just happen to not be dangerous, or not dangerous to the right people, or only in an endearing way.\nIn some cases, the Cute Monster might be an Eldritch Abomination themselves, see also Adorable Abomination.\n"}
{"EverythingsDeaderwithZombies": "There's a Romero-style zombie shambling around, but it's not a Zombie Apocalypse. So what's it doing here? Because zombies are cool. Whether it's to set up a Low Fantasy setting with necromantic Horrors, add an element of comedy, or simply to add variety, some works of fiction feature Zombies in a less than central position. It doesn't even have to have a reason. The zombie is there just because.\nThis is something of a popular advertising gimmick for games, MMORPG's, and Comic Books these days. Just like slapping Wolverine on the cover adds to sales, a \"zombie invasion\", \"Halloween Episode\", or other stunt can drive up sales and give a fun Breather Episode from more plot heavy story arcs.\nThis could also work if there actually is a Zombie Apocalypse, but it's not part of the main story. It's just thrown in there as a parody or homage with little lasting effect on the plot.\n"}
{"InstantDeathRadius": "Sometimes the best way to make a powerful boss character is to make sure that they have really, really good melee/short-ranged attacks. So good, in fact, that it's just about impossible for a player character to get anywhere near this boss without ending up dead in a matter of seconds. This is because the boss in question is contained in an Instant Death Radius \u2014 an attack range in which they can easily kill you, but in which you are just about incapable of even getting close enough to touch them, let alone denting them.\nDone well, this kind of enemy can force a player into using a very clear kind of strategy \u2014 keep as far away from it as possible and use ranged attacks, wait for an opening when it can't attack and strike quickly, or throw enough Cannon Fodder units at it that it can't wipe all of them out at once. But other times this kind of enemy can be incredibly aggravating when there's major character customization involved. Sure, you want to play a melee-focused class such as a warrior, but guess what \u2014 the monster's attack radius is much larger than yours, and their attacks are substantially stronger. Level up as you might, trying to go mano a mano with this thing is going to result in your death no matter how many Critical Hits you land (generally zero \u2014 one if you're lucky).\nA Puzzle Boss may invoke this trope as a way of making it perfectly clear to the player that they're not going to beat it by conventional means, as will the Tactical Suicide Boss to ensure that the player waits for their opening. A Short-Range Shotgun may cause this effect. See also Area of Effect; a monster with an Instant Death Radius may make use of such area-of-effect abilities centered on itself as a means of denoting that radius.\n"}

{"LockDown": "A location is isolated by means of locking every door/window/refrigerator/ air vent/other entrance in the area so that no one can get in or out of the building. For the medical cases surrounding this, it is a quarantine. Armed guards may also be posted, depending on whether or not the military is involved.\nWhen this begins, the odds are 99% someone will attempt a Indy Hat Roll.\nAlso see: Trapped in Containment and Quarantine with Extreme Prejudice. Quite likely to result in Failsafe Failure or Didn't See That Coming if the plot demands whatever is in lockdown escapes. Has nothing to do with a certain Cybertronian bounty hunter. Often the preface for a Bottle Episode.\n"}
{"PlotlineDeath": "When someone dies in a cutscene, because the story gods have demanded it. It doesn't always fit with how the game handles combat death and wounds, be they Non-Lethal K.O. or Only Mostly Dead and it doesn't matter how many extra lives the player has left. Characters who have taken fireballs (and worse) to the face at pointblank range will be felled with a single gunshot or stab wound, even if they're level 99. Don't even try your resurrection magic, it would be wrong. A few games actually see magic users or clerics attempting to heal fallen characters, but failing, somehow implying that the dying character is injured in a way beyond conventional methods of healing to help. It's technically a Hand Wave, but they tried. Another reason this could be is that the spells do not have the power to bring back the dead, they just can revive the unconscious. Sometimes this happens in RTS games as well, where in most levels a death can easily be fixed by building the relevant unit production structure. This is generally because developers found that when players weren't able to build heroes back during campaigns, they'd frequently ignore some of the most powerful units for fear of them dying.\nIf the killed character is an NPC, it's even worse, the gameplay mechanic usually simply doesn't allow the player to revive such a character.\nThe flip-side is that, occasionally, what the story gods took away, they may give back; there may be a way to bring someone Back from the Dead in a cutscene, but it's usually optional. If not, well, that's what makes it drama.\nUsually a glaring example of gameplay and story segregation. Very commonly part of a Player Punch and Death by Origin Story.\nRoughly, this is the worst form of death in video games, going plotline death, Final Death, Only Mostly Dead, and Non-Lethal K.O..\nInevitably, a character who is killed in this way will generate an Urban Legend of Zelda regarding how they can be revived, even if actually reviving them is impossible.\nInverse of Cutscene Power to the Max, where a character does nigh-impossible feats, including defying death, merely by the virtue of being in a cutscene.\nThis is obviously a death trope. It contains major unmarked spoilers, so read at your own risk.\n"}
{"PhysicalHell": "Hell on Earth, literally. In most cases, Hell is something you don't have to worry about unless you're on the negative side of the Karma Meter, and even then, only if you're careless enough to die. Even if it's more tangible, it's usually on the other side of a Hell Gate which can be handily sealed up if necessary at a maximum of a few thousand human sacrifices to the dark ones. Then there are the unlucky worlds which have the ultimate in Crapsack Worlds in their backyards.\nUsually deep underground, occupied by the physical Legions of Hell and probably making themselves felt on the human lands above them. In particularly bad cases they may be unstoppable, and the only hope is to avoid disturbing them in the first place. In more optimistic settings, some heroes may find themselves completely occupied keeping the demons at bay and stopping them from ravaging their fellow humans. Should they manage to fight the demons off, only the truly mightiest of heroes can actually take the step of invading hell, and most won't be the most stable individuals after the experience.\nIf the humans are lucky, heaven will also have set up shop in the region. If they're even luckier, the hapless monkeys won't end up caught in the supernatural crossfire.\nHell on Earth is when Hell was originally in another dimension, but is deciding to colonise the physical realm and create this situation. Or just kill everyone; demons are fickle like that. Mordor is related \u2014 a dark physical realm which is like hell but often isn't explicitly said or even meant to be hell, just an inherently evil land.\n"}
{"MontyHaul": "Monty Hall (note the lack of a \"U\") was the host on the game show Let's Make a Deal, which was cancelled before some of you were born. The show could give away massive amounts of prizes to the lucky winner (or cunning or destined-to-win or however they pick winners on game shows).\nA Monty Haul campaign (with a \"U\") was the generic label for a Game Master (and his/her campaign) who would run adventures that were like game show giveaways, except the questions weren't as hard. Players would end up staggering under the loads of gold and gems (except the encumbrance rules often were ignored as well) and cherry-picking which magic items they wanted to keep because they had so many to choose from. Think of Conan the Barbarian with a Star Destroyer.\nAlso, in the first and second editions of Dungeons & Dragons, Player Characters got Experience Points based on how much money they looted, one to one. So the Monty Haul characters would also end up at stratospheric Character Levels, which would lead to situations in which they were assassinating gods to gain their nifty weapons.\nThis is a situation most gamers greatly deplore and is sternly discouraged in the Game Master's section of all later games, but it is assumed that everyone went through this stage at some early point in their gaming \"careers.\"\nIn some other cases though, the Monty Haul game master may be a case of Suspicious Game Master Generosity since sometimes they may take it to bring upon an already dangerous foe and give him a slew of new tricks or has their stats tweaked for whatever to get ready for a tougher battle.\nMany video games seem to either encourage or require the sort of player (or the sort of game play) who would take a broom to a dungeon, to make sure he swept up all the coins.\nIn video games, Monty Haul levels are sometimes confined to DLC, overlapping with Bribing Your Way to Victory.\nThe opposite of this is the Killer Game Master, who delivers death and horror to the PCs in place of treasure and godlike power.\nThis doesn't have much to do with the Monty Hall Problem, a probability puzzle whose name also comes from the game show host.\n"}
{"DontGoIntoTheWoods": "In horror/thriller/fantasy movies, holidays or outings in woodsy locations never seem to bode all that well. This trope is Older Than Dirt, with the wilderness being viewed as dangerous for much of human history.\nTwo or more people, often a group of teenagers, go for a casual hike or a vacation at a secluded retreat in the deciduous wilderness of North America or Europe. Horrible things ensue. The soon-to-be-not-so-happy campers get stalked through the trees by psychopathic killers; they run afoul of tribes of inbred hillbillies; ghosts, werewolves, witches, druids, fairies and other such beings toy with them; malevolent eyes gaze at them from every shadow; perhaps even the trees themselves attack them; they hear strange noises in the night; people disappear; people go insane.\nRarely do movies of this flavor end happily; often with everyone ends up dead, although there may be a Final Girl. This has almost gotten to the point at which such movies almost have Foregone Conclusions.\nThe horror equivalent of the Horrible Camping Trip; for a doomed wilderness expedition, see River of Insanity; sometimes may overlap with Wild Wilderness but with much darker overtones. See also The Lost Woods, for when forests are portrayed as enchanted, mysterious and full of strange things, which may or may not overlap with this trope. Subtrope of Deadly Road Trip. See also Swamps Are Evil.\n"}
{"TheSuperego": "\"Captain, the logical course of action in this situation is to let the inhabitants of Pupolon fend for themselves. We need the device keeping the planet's orbit stable, or risk endangering the very existence of The Federation. I am aware of the consequences for the local population, Doctor, but simply rushing in to 'save the high priestess' will leave us open to a Klingon ambush with a 78.52% probability of outright destruction. I realize this is a hard choice, Captain, but the needs of the many must outweigh the needs of the few.\"\nThis character will always think before acting. The Spock is an archetype that can be loosely summed up as the tendency to apply rules, reason and the greater good to all of his/her decisions. This character can exist by themselves, but more often, they will have a more emotional and humanistic counterpart to contrast their decisions. The main difference between the two archetypes is that while The McCoy will leap before looking, The Spock's solution to problems will have a balanced and well-thought out approach.\nThe Spock's relationship with his crewmates/comrades is often tense, because this character type is willing and able to ruthlessly consider ethically troubling situations without batting an eye \u2014 especially situations where people might be ordered to die. While his counterpart The McCoy is interested in doing the right thing regardless of cost, The Spock is more interested in the end result. For him, everyone (including himself) is expendable and he has no problem treating people as such.\nThe Spock maintains audience sympathy by being willing to Take a Third Option and also by being as ruthless about his own life as the lives of his crewmates, if not more so. Even better, he is utterly unflappable in the face of serious problems or danger; his friends know that no matter how terrifying or hopeless things get, he will never lose his cool and will not stop working on a solution to save everyone. He will not have a problem hearing The McCoy's side of things, though.\nWhen put in a Power Trio (or Freudian Trio) with The Kirk and The McCoy, he becomes the superego in Id, Superego, & Ego. The Spock will at times become a Tin Man, though this varies with the writing, and will often have No Sense of Humor. When he has emotion, he may sometimes express it with a Fascinating Eyebrow and nothing more. Since Smart People Play Chess, if The Spock plays a game, it will invariably be a variant of chess.\nClosely related to The Stoic, Agent Scully, Emotionless Girl, and Little Miss Snarker. Often becomes a Straw Vulcan, but occasionally ends up on the winning side of Emotions vs. Stoicism. Probably sides with the Enlightenment in Romanticism Versus Enlightenment. Well Intentioned Extremists often come across similarly when they believe they're working for the greater good.

{"EnemyScan": "An item, ability, or spell that when used provides the player with otherwise hidden information about the current enemy. This will often reveal the enemy's Hit Points, Mana Meter, attacks, weaknesses (in RPGs, especially magic-based ones), or may just provide a general description of the enemy. Often shown in the form of Stat-O-Vision, even if it's a magical spell.\nSome games feature a Monster Encyclopedia of sorts that may be filled if the player wants 100% Completion (in turn requiring the player to traverse the world and perform this on every single enemy). Frustratingly, this can result in Permanently Missable Content if the enemy (or a specific variation of it) only appears a limited number of times.\nThis may or may not work on bosses, especially the Final Boss. But it usually does work on Helpful Mooks.\nCan become a Useless Useful Spell if it can only scan weak enemies you don't need to know much about to defeat.\nSee also Robo Cam, where a shot is filmed from a robot's point of view, often used when the robot performs an Enemy Scan. Also compare Sherlock Scan, where the information isn't hidden but is so subtle and obscure that interpreting it requires a special mindset.\n"}
{"FanserviceCostumes": "Media frequently display characters (usually women) in skimpy clothing or no clothing at all to reward or entice viewers (after all, Sex Sells). A number of these sexy costume choices have become tropes unto themselves.\n"}
{"TheUnChosenOne": "Where The Chosen One is the ultimate victim of Because Destiny Says So, the Unchosen One is the ultimate perpetrator of Screw Destiny. This is the hero or heroine who stands up, not because of a prophecy, but because they feel the need or desire to stop the Big Bad (sometimes doing so in spite of a prophecy). The Unchosen One is, in essence, a Chosen One who chooses themselves.\nThe reasons for this can vary. Perhaps the Chosen One missed or refused the call, or was killed or incapacitated by a Destiny Screwing villain. Or, in a twist, the Chosen One is the villain and the Unchosen One decides to stop them. If all the prophecies say evil will triumph, the Unchosen One's reply would be \"screw that.\" Perhaps they were Refused by the Call and decided that they should go on adventuring anyway by their own terms. It could also be nothing more than a simple chance encounter allowing them to intercept the Call to Adventure in place of the real Chosen One. Every so often, the Unchosen is also a Chosen One who's decided to save the world of their own will, regardless of Fate.\nOf course, because they aren't The Chosen One, things won't be laid out on a silver platter like a proper Chosen Hero often gets. They'll more often have to earn their place as The Hero. If there is a being or force doing the Choosing, they'll eventually have to acknowledge the Hero even if he wasn't the Chosen One. They may also have to deal with the possibility that The Chosen One will get the credit for all of their hard work. On the other hand, even the Chosen One might look in awe of this hero who created great things on his own efforts and is beholden to no one and no destiny.\nAn Unchosen One has high odds of being a Heroic Wannabe, a Determinator, or any other hero type that is likely to jump at the call. There's also the possibility of the Unchosen One being a Badass Unintentional, someone who actually doesn't want to save the world but may be the only one in a position to do so. A possible fate for those who Missed the Call.\nSome writers can't escape from this frame of thinking, though, and they occasionally write in that the character really was the Chosen One after all. Another common way to work around it is an ontological argument: someone was bound to eventually take up the sword against Emperor Evulz and lead the revolution to overthrow him. There could even be many heroes working together or independently to take him down. The \"Chosen One\" just happened to be the one who ultimately succeeded, and could easily have been replaced by any of the others had circumstances been different.\nCompare Anti Anti Christ where someone is the Dark Messiah for the bad guys and tells them to take a hike.\n"}
{"TeleportationSpam": "A character with the power of teleportation milks it for all it's worth, and, in a fight, uses their power to constantly disappear and appear at will, hitting, running, and flanking without any effort at all and barely any threat of counterattack.\nUsually, a character like this is defeated in one of three ways. Disable their teleportation ability, trick them into trapping themselves, or give them a well-placed Offhand Backhand just as they come out of their teleport.\nA common tactic of video game bosses. Very likely to cause a Snap to the Side. Inertia Is a Cruel Mistress could put a stop to it.\nSometimes only antagonists can do this, largely because of Villain Teleportation. If made possible by Faster-Than-Light Travel and performed only once or twice, it is a Hyperspeed Ambush. If a character teleports over and over, not to fight someone but to travel long distances, they're probably a Multistage Teleport.\nCompare Speed Blitz, a similar effect that is achieved by spamming Flash Step, and thus a form of Super Speed rather than actual teleportation.\n"}
{"DroppedAbridgeOnHim": "When a character is permanently written out of a show, especially killed off, in a way that is unexpectedly anti-climactic or mundane, they Dropped a Bridge on Him.\nThis can be a case of Writer on Board (or worse, Running the Asylum), but may also be an attempt to make the best of a difficult, real life situation.\nSometimes, when a character is Killed Off for Real in a universe where Death Is Dramatic, a lot of work is put into it. They may make a Heroic Sacrifice, or have A Death in the Limelight in their last appearance. If done well enough, it might even be their Dying Moment of Awesome. This trope applies when such things are generally expected, often because of previous dramatic deaths in the series, but don\u2019t happen. Note that when Anyone Can Die, this trope does not apply.\nTo compare, take the NYPD Blue death of Det. Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits) versus the death of Det. Danny Sorenson (Rick Schroder). Smits dies of Soap Opera Disease with a Tear Jerker sendoff. Schroder left the series, so his character is killed off-screen, between seasons.\nNamed for the death of Captain Kirk (William Shatner) in Star Trek: Generations, which was expected to be a key, climactic event after 30 years of adventuring. Instead, he was killed beneath a collapsed bridge in a manner typically reserved for Red Shirts.\nWhen done off-screen (like the Sorenson example), it's known as a Bus Crash. See also McLeaned, Sudden Sequel Death Syndrome, Distracted from Death and Not So Invincible After All. If this is done to a character repeatedly with the aid of Negative Continuity, see They Killed Kenny Again. If you're looking for this trope on an expanded scale, see Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies.\nNot to confuse with Dropped a Bridget on Him, the former trope name for Unsettling Gender Reveal.\nAs a Death Trope, all spoilers will be unmarked ahead. Beware.\n"}
{"FadSuper": "The Sliding Timescale can have a particularly odd effect on these characters, since it often restricts their debut to only a few years before \"now\", suggesting that such characters decided to base themselves on, say, a 1960s theme in the late 2000s. Villains who are Fad Supers have a higher chance of being kept, since they are usually intended to be eccentric, out of place, and theme-based.\nThis isn't the same as an existing hero's ability or story being tweaked in response to the times, such as Silver Age technobabble revisionism. Compare with Captain Ethnic, Cyclic National Fascination, Totally Radical, and We're Still Relevant, Dammit!. Contrast with Old Superhero, who is outdated on purpose. Particularly prone to being the subject of Reimagining the Artifact if brought back.\n"}
{"WeWereRehearsingAPlay": "Two characters are caught in the middle of doing something they do not want others to know about, like talking openly about the Masquerade, fighting among each other or making out. Since the situation is blatantly obvious, the only option is to claim that it was all just an act. Probably for a School Play.\nBonus points if this gets taken so far that the play actually ends up being written.\nA subtrope of Blatant Lies. Compare Hurricane of Excuses. Compare It's for a Book. See also All Part of the Show, Film Felons.\n"}
{"CrossReferencedTitles": "A lesser form of Idiosyncratic Episode Naming, when two related episodes of a series reference each other in their episode titles. Sequel Episodes often use these, but other times the titles might be the only explicit link between the episodes.\nIf the two titles fit together to make a phrase, that's Compound Title.\nAlso used across different members of a Series Franchise.\n"}
{"WickedStepMother": "The Wicked Stepmother, the woman hostile to her stepchildren, is a perennial trope. Older Than Feudalism, she appears constantly in legends and folklore around the world, and is the villain of many a Fairy Tale.\nPsychologists hypothesize that she is an Archetypal Character, devised by children to contain all they hate in their mothers so they can continue to regard Mother as perfect. Some historians, meanwhile, believe that the trope has didactic roots, and that it was developed as a way of warning children against potentially untrustworthy suitors that might try to court their widowed parents for their wealth or their nobility; indeed, Death by Childbirth was extremely common in the Middle Ages, leading to many children of the period being raised by stepmothers.\nSadly enough, Truth in Television; children are vastly more likely to be abused by stepparents. In fact, in some languages, the word for \"stepmother\" is the word for \"mother\" followed by a pejorative suffix.note\u00a0In Spanish madrastra \u2014 the Latin suffix is the same as in \"poetaster,\" a hack poet; in French, the cognate mar\u00e2tre is now so associated with this trope that it's only used for wicked ones, with the common word being belle-m\u00e8re, same as \"mother-in-law.\" Even centuries of subversion have not transformed her even into a Discredited Trope; she can still be played either straight or subverted.\nShe generally favors her own children \u2014 whether from a previous marriage or this one \u2014 over her stepchildren. Not that that causes this trope, because it's kind of natural. It's just another symptom. Sometimes her economic motives are made clear: there is only so much to go around, and she wants it for herself or her own children. An equivalent male figure is the Evil Uncle \u2014 because inheritance is generally through the male line, the uncle can inherit his brother's children's estate. Envy is another common cause; the Wicked Stepmother either wants to be Fairest of Them All or to have her daughters be so.\nOn the other hand, the stepsiblings or halfsiblings can but need not be hostile to the hero(ine). If they are hostile, Youngest Child Wins is trumped by the older child's stepchild status.\nThe father is seldom a factor. If not dead (which is common), he will nevertheless never intervene on his child's behalf.\nHer tactics vary widely. She may simply oppress the heroine, keeping her in rags and slaving at household work \u2014 sometimes going as far as assigning the Impossible Task. As a Wicked Witch, she may transform the child(ren) into animals. She may drive or send them off. She may act violently toward them and even kill them (and perhaps cap that by cooking them up and serving them to their father.)\nThe stepchild(ren) may succeed in defeating her through help from their real though dead mother \u2014 the Grimms' version of \"Cinderella\", \"Aschenputtel\", has Aschenputtel get her gowns from the tree planted on her mother's grave. Talking Animals may also feature, as can a Fairy Godmother. These figures can do everything from performing the Impossible Task on behalf of the child to ensuring that She Cleans Up Nicely despite the dirt and rags she is reduced to.\nThis trope is sometimes the result of writers attempting to Bowdlerise fairy tales by transforming a cruel mother into a wicked stepmother. For instance, Grimms' original tales of \"Snow White\" and \"Hansel and Gretel\" both featured a cruel mother.\nGiven her status as a villain, the Wicked Stepmother's chances of surviving the ending are not good. The Happily Ever After ending of most fairy tales often dwells with more detail on how the Wicked Stepmother and/or her children were punished than on the hero and happiness. On the other hand, stepmothers who are not disposed of often return; when she is not executed at the wedding, she may, for instance, try to kill the heroine when she gives birth and replace her with her own daughter; so the Fairy Tale doesn't end (happily or not) until she's dead.\nSometimes preceded by a Guess Who I'm Marrying? scenario. Can involve a Missing Mom; older stories usually do, often caused by Death by Childbirth.\nA common subversion is the jealous Daddy's Girl regarding any stepmother as a Wicked Stepmother; see Parent with New Paramour for cases where it's the children who are in the wrong.\nThe Red-Headed Stepchild is a particular victim.\nSubtrope of Evil Matriarch. Note that the Magical Nanny often becomes a stepmother, but never a wicked one. Department of Child Disservices is a modern organized variation. Usually, Social Services Does Not Exist in stories with a Wicked Stepmother. Contrast Good Stepmother for the trope's logical antithesis.\n"}
{"HunterOfTheirOwnKind": "This is where you have Group X which is Always Chaotic Evil. Then there's Character Y, who somehow has the powers of Group X but has a conscience, often because he or she is a Phlebotinum Rebel or a Half-Human Hybrid of Warring Natures. So, Character Y becomes a Hunter of Monsters, and Defends Against Their Own Kind, allowing him to use his powers for a good cause. Sometimes, this turns out badly for the Hunter when it is revealed that his targets actually aren't totally evil, and a case of Van Helsing Hate Crimes can result.\nFor some reason, vampires seem particularly prone to doing this. You will see Dhampyrs, Friendly Neighborhood Vampires, and especially Vampire Detectives engaging in it. Maybe it's because they like to turn their enemies out of spite.\nSee Also: Boomerang Bigot, My Species Doth Protest Too Much, and Stages of Monster Grief. Someone who actually succeeds in killing off their entire people or clan has committed Genocide from the Inside. Predator Turned Protector may lead to them protecting their supposed \"prey\" from their own kind, who feeds on the same prey. Contrast Monsters Anonymous. Compare Pro-Human Transhuman.\n"}
{"CassandraGambit": "An organization, often a Government Agency of Fiction, deliberately releases secret information, sometimes within a work of fiction, in order to invoke a Cassandra Truth. Alternatively, an individual or small group may do this to get the word out to allies and others in the know despite people/groups/governments who don't want the word to get out; the fictional/tabloid nature of the outlet provides cover for these Cassandras to stave off retaliation from their opponents. They're just smart enough to know that You Wouldn't Believe Me If I Told You. It also allows them to honestly state, \"Well a lot of people got that idea from this book, which is a work of fiction\". They can then turn on their critics and say they're too credulous or are confusing fiction and reality.\nThe differences between this and Sarcastic Confession are that the confessors aren't being sarcastic, and they are addressing themselves to many people rather than one or two. Unlike a Public Secret Message, which is published in the open but in code, a Cassandra Gambit is straightforward: what is said is what is meant. She knows others won't believe it, but hopes someone out there (\"the right listener\") will believe and act on it.\nSuper trope of Fiction as Cover-Up. Compare Getting Crap Past the Radar, Hidden in Plain Sight, Refuge in Audacity and Sarcastic Confession. The topic these Cassandras are warning about is likely to be the Elephant in the Living Room. Strategy #1 of The Thirty-Six Stratagems.\n"}
{"WrongGirlFirst": "The resulting plot when a Love Triangle is used to illustrate the Aesop \"Be Careful Who You Give Your Heart To\".\nOur heroine is a young woman with two suitors. Suitor #1 is rich and handsome. He is charming, witty and charismatic. He seems to be everything a young woman would want. But he's not.\nSuitor #2 appears to be flawed. If he's rich, he's not as rich as Suitor #1. If he's handsome, he's not as handsome. He could be many years older than our heroine. He often has the kind of personality that makes him hard to get to know.\nSo naturally, our heroine picks Suitor #1. And she's happy, for a while. But then things go horribly wrong.\nMaybe Suitor #1 leaves town for a while, and returns with a fiancee. Maybe his parents persuade him that our heroine isn't good enough for him. Maybe our heroine has money problems, or family problems, or health problems, and Suitor #1 uses them as an excuse to break things off. Maybe he keeps coming up with excuses to put off the marriage (Unable to Support a Wife, for example). By his actions, he has shown himself to be the wrong guy.\nJust when our heroine despairs of any help, who arrives in her hour of need? Suitor #2! He doesn't expect our heroine to fall in love with him, but he helps her anyway. He just wants his beloved to be happy.\nThis story often has a happy ending. All that's needed is for the heroine to recognize that Suitor #2 is the right guy, and fall in love with him. He never cares that he's her second choice.\nWhy does the young woman choose the wrong guy first? Because if she picked the right guy first, there wouldn't be a plot.\nIn many cases, Suitor #1 may be the local bad boy, because... well, you know. If a character can never choose between two suitors, then this is a case of Betty and Veronica instead. Compare First Girl Wins. This same general plot can work with the genders inverted, so that it's the Wrong Girl First.\nThis trope is often used by fanfic writers in a Die for Our Ship scenario, where Suitor #1 is portrayed as abusive and cruel (regardless of him/her ''really'' being like that or not) in order to justify having the young woman/young man run into the arms of Suitor #2.\n"}
{"EveryoneHasASpecialMove": "In a series with a heavy emphasis on fight scenes and combat, characters will often be differentiated by differing fighting styles and combat moves. It is important in any series to make important characters distinctive enough so that everyone doesn't begin look like clones, and this is one way to take that distinction into the battlefield as well.\nAction series solve the bulk of their conflict through fight scenes, but if everyone were to fight in a standard militarized way, then the action scenes would seem so separated from the characterization scenes that they would get boring after a while.\nThat is where this trope comes into play. A character's personality can be shown by how they fight. Giving every character in an action series a unique Signature Move can be a good way to show off their personalities (For example: the Big Guy could have a earthquake stomp attack or the Smart Guy could use machines). Superpowers can also work in the same way, as distinct superpowers can individualise the characters.\nThis trope uses rule of cool, to significantly push up the Willing Suspension of Disbelief on character development. Characters in said series can be a Static Character who never really changes much but don't need to if the trope is well done.\nAs this trope is always used in action oriented series with characters who do change over time, they may gain new abilities as their personality or motivations change. This is sometimes justified by having their powers tied to certain emotions.\nThis trope shows up quite a lot in Sh\u014dnen Fighting Series, Comic Books, and Video Games where pretty much every fighting character who is not a mook has at least one. Whether or not said special move has any effectiveness is completely dependent upon the needs of the story and the character's general role in it. A comic relief Joke Character, for example, may have a completely useless special move, or it can be subverted by making it seem that way until he gets serious.\nIn gaming, this trope is a basic form of Competitive Balance, as these special moves, powers, or skills provide different advantages for every character so nobody will be too weak. Also, it can let players find the one character with special moves that suits their style.\nSister trope of Super Power Lottery. See also Cast of Snowflakes, Color-Coded Characters, Personality Powers. Compare Everyone is a Super, which will likely result in this trope as well if everyone's superpowers are unique to them. Sub-Trope of Signature Move, where it's not necessary to have everyone get at least one of that. Very important in Fighting Series and Professional Wrestling.\n"}
{"AccidentalTickleTorture": "Accidental Tickle Torture is the result of when a ticklish sensation is caused but has (or had) neither friendly or malicious intentions. Most examples involve something curiously checking someone out by touching them in odd places, however there are times when a villain does something to a character that he intended to be Cold-Blooded Torture, only to wind up with their victim laughing from a ticklish response.\nCompare Squirrels in My Pants since some of their cases has its victim laughing. Also I Didn't Mean to Turn You On.\n"}
{"InappropriateRoleModel": "An Inappropriate Role Model is a person who is uncouth, unsavoury, or insane; A person who really shouldn't be idolised or emulated, yet (s)he is, often by some poor misguided fool.\nMay be a result of Misaimed Fandom. Compare also Anti-Role Model.\n"}
{"TheResistance": "Wherever The Empire is, you'll always find La R\u00e9sistance: A Ragtag Bunch of Misfits using The Power of Love and Friendship to fight against a tyrannical rule, often to help put the Government in Exile back into power. Always underdogs, they fight using guerrilla warfare and by raising the rabble of the people by revealing unpleasant truths about The Empire they've been trying to hide, causing the oppressed peoples to shake off the yokes of their tyrant rulers. Usually led by a Rebel Leader and armed via Vehicular Turnabout. Expect them to be opposed by Les Collaborateurs.\nAlmost inevitably, the hero will join La Resistance while the battle is already underway, and will grow to become a great champion in the fight against The Empire. After all, Hollywood usually romanticizes resistance fighters. There are two reasons. The first is rooted in America's origins as rebels fighting the English during The American Revolution. The second is likewise World War II where the conflict between the Resistance and Nazi Germany fell, as close as it ever has, to clear divisions between right and wrong. In most cases in history and in real-life, resistance movements are complex and confusing events. A common mistake is to confuse resistance movements with revolutionary movements, when this is not always the case. Some resistance movements are revolutionary, seeking to install a new regime to displace the old. Revolutions, needless to say, are complex, murky and at times brutal affairs. It has led in the past to the new regime forming the new government which can be as bad or worse than the old.\nOf course, people rarely like having it pointed out that these groups are terrorists from the perspective of anyone who disagrees with them and Innocent Bystanders who may get caught up in the crossfire of said conflicts. This may be deliberately ironic, perhaps inviting a \"we are Not So Different\" moment. Or, the author might simply assume that the audience will always sympathize with rebel protagonists against The Empire, therefore moral justification of the rebellion is unnecessary and the rebels can get away with whatever is expedient. This could be averted if the Evil Empire really is evil and the rebels exercise chivalry and restraint.\nAlternatively, La Resistance will be utterly incompetent and little more than an annoyance until the hero gets in there and shows them how it's done. Sometimes their inner dissensions render them nearly unable to get anything done. Expect at least one member of La Resistance to be The Mole, or a homegrown Les Collaborateurs sabotaging their efforts from the inside. La Resistance may even be defeated without the assistance of its enemy: when the only thing uniting it is opposition to The Empire, they may end up clashing thanks to some point of ideology (generally portrayed as stupid) or method (generally portrayed as worthwhile).\nAlso alternatively, La Resistance may represent the last remnants of the reactionary or counter-revolutionary cronies of the old regime fighting against the Revolutionary Progressive Forces. Once re-installed, the Resistance \"heroes\" decide to Retcon the revolution and institute purges for the cause of revenge, and remind people why exactly they were toppled in the first place. In some cases, as it happened in some parts of World War II, the Resistance contains factions who want to restore the old regime and factions which want to bring a new regime, and these two factions might struggle during and after the war.\nWhen La Resistance form the main ensemble of the show, or one of them, they'll frequently exhibit a mix of characters similar to The Squad. However, they'll usually have sneakier methods, they tend to be more morally pragmatic and ruthless than most Squads, and in series like Battlestar Galactica members becoming Shell Shocked Veterans.\nSometimes La Resistance can be downright nasty. Usually, though, even at it\u2019s worst La Resistance will be the Lesser of Two Evils. If not, Gray and Grey Morality may be at play. In an interesting twist, if the resistance is every bit as unscrupulous as The Empire, then the hero will end up doing a bit of Conspiracy Redemption or forming a third faction. Very occasionally, La Resistance may even be the Big Bad rebelling against a peaceful government.\nEventually, La Resistance will either die out, or grow into The Alliance as it gains power, allies, and sympathizers.\nFor the villainous equivalent, see The Remnant. For the opposite of La Resistance, see Les Collaborateurs. Sometimes La Resistance may not be heroes but villains, as happens in an Enemy Civil War.\nNot to be confused with the First-Person Shooter series, Resistance.

{"FieldPowerEffect": "In Real Life combatants naturally seek the high ground and other places on the battlefield with tactically advantageous Geo Effects, and to maneuver their opponents into tactically disadvantageous positions. A related tactic is to affect allied and enemy morale to make the fighting easier. In fiction the Field Power Effect is a third, supernatural way to make a given set of characters (whether heroes or villains) stronger or weaker.\nA Field Power Effect is a spell or environmental condition that affects the fighting ability of one or more characters, strengthening and/or weakening them. Weather and terrain may play a factor, such as a pyrokinetic being weak during a rainstorm while an aquakinetic gains more power. Or a solar powered hero being strongest at noon and weakest when in pitch black darkness. Terrain like the Place of Power affect characters atuned to the type of energy it boosts (and its opposite). You can probably tell that due to Elemental Rock\u2013Paper\u2013Scissors, any Field Power Effect that boosts one set of Elemental Powers will weaken whatever is in its opposition. This is similar to how opposing sides with the ability to use Status Buff and Status-Buff Dispel can also end up canceling each other out. Other possibilities include things like time of day, year, or even the positions of planets and stars.\nThe reason Field Power Effects work is they somehow affect the Power Source of characters, or failing that their soul. An area filled with Light energy naturally strengthens characters who are good-aligned, while evil characters who are Weakened by the Light will suffer a Depowering. It'd take a very strong Cross-Melting Aura on the part of a villain to overpower that kind of disadvantage. The reverse is also true, an evil wizard who emanates Dark Side energy will make heroes quake and those Allergic to Evil outright faint. In both cases the character will feel soul pains.\nJust to clarify, it's also possible for a Field Power Effect to just boost or drain without pairing both.\nSee Mook Commander for enemies who have this kind of effect to their troops.\n"}
{"EveryoneCallsHimBarKeep": "A Sub-Trope of No Name Given in which a character is not just a \"victim\" of Only One Name, but is only known by his job title or some other descriptive moniker, or an obscure or odd word that functions as an unusual nickname.\nDifferent from Only Known by Their Nickname, in that it is actually describing what they do.

{"VillainousBSoD": "Only a scant few villains work under a conventional moral framework with standards, fewer acknowledge the egocentricity implicit in the wrong they do, a distressing number are beyond all attempts at being reasoned with. And to make things worse, these also tend to be too powerful to beat.\nIn these cases, the only solution is for the heroes to actively Care-Bear Stare him into growing a conscience to make him voluntarily stop his rampage... because the accumulated shame, guilt, and mental instability over his misdeeds will be too much for him to bear. The heroes may not have used Mind Rape on him but they might as well have, because now that he has the heart and conscience of a hero he cannot help but suffer a Heroic BSoD He'll weep openly, become suicidal, and may either will himself into non existence or beg to be killed. The heroes have basically Talked the Monster to Death by helping him grow a conscience.\nThe exact reaction depends on the villain and the weight of his sins. One that had not yet gotten to do much more than Poke the Poodle or Kick the Dog once may survive with emotional counseling. If he slipped further? The black hole he's become will finally crush him. Things can get really interesting if the character, through his own fault, invited in Mind Control, Demonic Possession, or The Virus, and entirely remembers all the evil things he did under its control\u2014that would not have happened if he had fought it off, but which he had no control over.\nOne unlikely, but possible, outcome is that he reacts not with unbearable sadness but overwhelming anger at the heroes for daring to make him \"feel like this!\" This tends to make him even more dangerous. Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!.\nA common subversion has the villain turn out to be so evil that when they are forced to realise all the pain they have caused they either do not care or are downright happy about it.\nDespite the intense emotional anguish this causes, Heroes can pull this with impunity since it is not killing anyone (directly, anyway), saves lives, and in the long run is a fairly elegant form of justice that may even bring about a Heel\u2013Face Turn. Then again, they may do this knowing the effects are temporary and only do it to weaken the villain psychologically long enough to kill him. Even normal, moral people can turn evil, and they may reason they do not want to give him a second chance.\nSubtrope of Villainous Breakdown.

{"ProudScholarRaceGuy": "While the Proud Warrior Race believes in warfare and martial honor as the pinnacle of cultural achievement, they have a counterpart in the Proud Scholar Race, who instead focus on matters of the intellect. Personality-wise, they may be aloof and detached, or quite gregarious and friendly (particularly if they're also The Empath). Either way, they have a tendency to be more intellectual, mystical or philosophical than most of the other species in the setting. This species of scholars tends to come in two flavors:\nProud Scholar Races of either stripe tend to be portrayed as more peace-loving than some other species, but they tend to be rather dangerous when provoked, using superior technology, Psychic Powers and hidden superweapons to turn their foes into dust. They won't necessarily be portrayed as nicer people\u2014sometimes, their love of knowledge will make them sympathetic compared to the madmen running around hitting things with swords, but other times, it will make them cold, slimy and sinister compared to the honest fighters doing their duty for their country. Similarly, any non-scientists in this race (no matter how important to their society) will suffer Klingon Scientists Get No Respect\u2014err, Vulcan Warriors Get No Respect.\nThis race may be friendly toward humans, or it might shun them because it detests their violent ways, or sees them as so far below them as to be insects. This species might be descended from the Precursors, or at least remember a time when they existed.\nIf both these and the Warrior Race are played as villainous, they basically become a split about the two terrifying sides of the Nazis\u2014the Warriors are the mighty soldiers and strategists slaughtering and conquering, while the Scientists remain at home torturing people For Science! and for hate. For this reason, when villainous, the Scientist race may be prejudiced and regard other races as fodder for slavery and experimentation.\nWhen heroic, the race is quite likely to resemble an idealised depiction of the academic circles of the Ancient Greeks. Expect Crystal Spires and Togas or a Mary Suetopia. They may or may not be a Higher Tech Species.\nWhen the Proud Scholar Race and the Proud Warrior Race are in opposition or rivalry, they tend to form an Elves vs. Dwarves dynamic, with the former taking the role of the Elves. This convergent evolution may be why many scholarly races take on elf-like features like pointed ears and a humanoid appearance. They may still retain nonhuman features such as unusual skin or hair colors, though; pale colors such as light blue are popular. Females of this sort of species tend to overlap with Green-Skinned Space Babe if they're actual aliens.\nIf they are into both learning and killing, they're a Warrior Poet Race instead.

{"PowerPop": "Power pop is The Beatles meets The Who.\nThat's literally all there is to it. Power pop emerged as a genre in the middle of The '60s, and its basic characteristics have remained unchanged since then. Power pop basically denotes bands that try to sound like a cross between The Beatles and The Who. There's an emphasis on strong melodies and heavy use of Beatles-styled vocal harmonies, but this is married to loud guitars and somewhat \"aggressive\" drumming borrowed from the Who (with the jangly 12-string guitar sound of The Byrds often thrown in for good measure). The result? Well, pop music with balls, so its popularity probably isn't that surprising.\nFittingly, the term \"power pop\" was coined by Pete Townshend in a 1967 interview (quoted above) to describe his band's style. Their early singles like \"I Can't Explain\", \"The Kids Are Alright\" and \"Substitute\", helped codify the genre, merging strong Beatle-ish melodies wivth driving R&B-inspired rhythms and massive Marshall-stacked guitars. The Beatles themselves released harder-edged singles that helped inspire the genre, such as \"Day Tripper\" and \"Paperback Writer\", and The Kinks pretty much invented the style with the epic riffy \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night\", which were the template for \"I Can't Explain\".\nThe '70s represented the decade where Power pop came into its own as a genre, represented by artists like Badfinger (who enjoyed the patronage of The Beatles), The Raspberries, famous cult band Big Star, NRBQ, Nazz and Todd Rundgren. The genre also reached the peak of its mainstream popularity in the late seventies, represented chiefly by Cheap Trick and others like 20/20, The Cars, and The Knack. The Knack provided the genre's biggest hit with \"My Sharona\", but they suffered a huge backlash and a \"Knuke the Knack\" campaign over the perceived misogyny of their lyrics. Thanks to dumb British journalists who tended to use \"power pop\" as a catchall term, lots of bands that weren't really power pop got lumped into the genre, such as The Jam, Squeeze, the Buzzcocks, Elvis Costello, Blondie, XTC, and Nick Lowe (most of these bands were New Wave, Punk Rock or early Alternative Rock, with Squeeze and Nick Lowe being the closest to bona-fide Power Pop).\nPower pop dropped out of the spotlight after the end of the seventies but continued to thrive underground and proved to be an important influence on Alternative Rock bands - many of the early alt-rock bands, such as R.E.M., played Jangle Pop and owed a massive debt to power pop, especially Big Star. The genre has still had its occasional moments of mainstream success, such as Matthew Sweet's \"Girlfriend\", Gin Blossoms' \"Hey Jealousy\", Weezer's \"Buddy Holly\", and Walk the Moon's \"Shut Up and Dance\".\nPop Punk bands often claim to be power pop. Considering The Who inspired many of the first punk bands, this may not be surprising.\nArtists commonly associated with the genre:\n"}
{"CharacterCheck": "A Character Check is when the writer realizes the character is no longer behaving the way he or she was first portrayed, and tries to cover it up by throwing in a scene in which the character ostentatiously reverts to form. Related to Author's Saving Throw, but a Character Check seldom leads to any lasting change and is not necessarily popular with the fans, who may have become attached to the \"new\" version of the character and dislike the brief resurgence of the old one.\nVery common with Designated Villains or Jerkass characters who have moved into Jerk with a Heart of Gold territory; this sort of reminder of \"how things used to be\" is a frequent side effect of Badass Decay and Villain Decay. Also likely to result from Depending on the Writer. There is also a certain amount of Truth in Television here. Someone may have changed over time, but can still fall back on old habits now and again. However, fictional characters are usually expected to behave more consistently. This trope may make the audience exclaim, \"I Forgot Flanders Could Do That!\"\n"}
{"MoneyForNothing": "Almost all games contain some form of currency, and most place a heavy focus on earning money through various tasks. Ideally, money is supposed to a reward for a job well done, and you can exchange it for goods and services that advance your progress and/or add to the fun. In some genres, particularly An Entrepreneur Is You, money is the primary means of reaching your goal, or even the goal itself. But curiously, some games make it possible to earn lots of money without giving you useful ways to spend it, which can result from any of the following:\nAny of these factors tend to lead to a situation where you end up with huge amounts of money, either with nothing worthwhile to spend it on, or no way to spend it all\u2014that is, having a lot of money for nothing.\nIn RPGs, this trope occurs very frequently in the form where money is highly valuable at the start of the game, when your characters lack basic healing spells and items, but then becomes increasingly less useful as you progress through the game and acquire more than enough money, ample supplies of basic items, and weapons and equipment that are superior to those sold in shops.\nAnother common variation is when money is useful with regards to Sidequests and 100% Completion-related things, but is of little interest to players only interested in completing the main game.\nInexperienced players of games with both a Command & Conquer Economy and a Research system often run into a temporary version of this, having a monstrously robust income without the production capability, population cap or high technologies (or all three!) to spend their resources on.\nDevelopers will often attempt to address this problem by creating a sudden obstacle late in the game that requires an enormous amount of money. This arbitrary workaround is hardly more desirable. They can also opt to create Money Sinks.\nIn order to avert the player having more money than they could ever use, game designers will sometimes add places which require a different kind of currency. Compare Scoring Points.\nThe song \"Money for Nothing\" by Dire Straits is the Trope Namer, but not an example; that song is just about getting rich with little to no effort, while this trope adds the double meaning that the money you're earning for nothing is also good for nothing.\n"}
{"OutOfTheClosetIntoTheFire": "An LGBT character chooses to come out, or is Forcibly Outed, from their figurative closet and is harmed or dies. The world is not a nice place, and once it is revealed they are LGBT+, things go badly wrong. For this trope, once a character has come out they become a Cosmic Plaything, facing hardships from the natural world because they have dared to vocalize being queer.\nThey have stepped into the line of fire, being persecuted by the god of the story, for coming out. Alternatively, if they've been out but \"inactive\", once they enter a relationship or decide to transition, etc., they will experience this harm or death then. This character is probably not gonna live to see the next credits roll, and if they do, they will be significantly worse off than when the story started. Sometimes it takes a little longer, but with a noticeable build-up.\nThis may reinforce the old belief that inherently homosexuality isn't wrong, but accepting it and acting on it are.\nIn some cases, any direct violence may be attempts to \"straighten\" the character or force them to repent, though this is more commonly a Homophobic Hate Crime \u2014 examples where a character is physically trying to harm someone for being queer is that trope. Indeed, in works where the creators don't want to outright show murderous homophobia, they may opt for having what could be dubbed infallible bad luck happen instead.\nSub-Trope to Bury Your Gays and Coming-Out Story, may happen alongside being Forced Out of the Closet.\n"}
{"AlmightyIdiot": "For some, the temptation of god-like power becomes too great. However, this type of power was not meant for mere mortals to wield. The prospect of cramming that much power into a mortal vessel destroys the recipient's mind, leaving him an empty shell of a man with unlimited power but the mental faculties of a half-wit child, or worse, a feral animal.\nConversely, some gods or other powerful entities may grow beyond their bounds, steadily losing their sense and reason as their power grows, in the end leaving them nothing more than creatures based solely on instinct, with untold powers behind them. This sort of tale is common in a Cosmic Horror Story: A monster can be even more frightening if there's no point behind his actions, just mindless aggression, rage, or even simple curiosity.\nCompare With Great Power Comes Great Insanity, Mad God, and Tortured Monster. May be a result of Touched by Vorlons or Phlebotinum Overload.\n"}
{"TakingAdvantageofGenerosity": "Generosity is considered a good thing. Milking generosity is not. Yet some characters do it anyway.\nSay Bob offers Alice a little gift, or agrees to do Alice a favor, but Alice asks for more gifts or favors from Bob, or someone else, knowing she is likely to get it.\nThe reasons for this usually fall under varying degrees of gluttony, Greed and It's All About Me. Quite often those receiving these extra demands will feel obligated to fulfill them anyway, especially if these characters are Extreme Doormats, even when they feel like they are being taken for granted.\nUsually, this is portrayed as being a very Jerkass thing to do.\nCompare Moving the Goalposts, The Prima Donna, All Take and No Give (a variation of this with relationships). The Farmer and the Viper is a more extreme and outright villainous variant.\n"}
{"TheGreatBritishCopperCapture": "The average British bobby does not carry a gun, except in Northern Ireland and certain parts of Nottingham and London. Only about 7% of coppers are licensed to use firearms.\nThis means that when they encounter a criminal who does have a gun (which may either be a replica gun or real), they are often in rather serious trouble, because a stab vest (body armour designed to stop knife attacks) cannot stop bullets.\nIn most cases, the coppers know that there are likely to be guns involved and will send the Armed Response Units (police officers complete with Bulletproof Vests, helmets and Heckler and Koch MP5 submachine guns) in first. However, sometimes they get it wrong and a gun ends up being produced.\nThe copper ends up with a villain pointing a gun at them. The situation can go many ways from here:\nThe latter has four outcomes:\nSuch situations, fortunately, happen far more often in fiction than in real life.\n"}
{"RegeneratingMana": "This is when Mana, or a similar special power, recharges itself over time, whether it's magic points (or tech points, or psychic points, etc.) being restored, or spell and special attack uses being restored (in the case of Vancian Magic). As long as the magic restoration doesn't require using an item, ability, sleeping it off, etc.\nThe exact form can vary wildly. Sometimes the recharge can happen anywhere, sometimes it requires walking around, sometimes it requires standing still, sometimes it requires an item equipped, and sometimes the recharge only happens in certain spots.\nThis does not preclude magic also being restored by a healing area or item, but those tend to heal a greater amount than this trope, to make up for them not being as readily accessible.\nMany modern RPGs use a hybrid form: you have both the (slowly) regenerating mana that limits how many spells can be cast in succession and the spell Cool Downs, which limits how often a spell can be cast.\nA Sister Trope to Mana Potion, Regenerating Health, Gradual Regeneration.\nCompare Cool Down, Trauma Inn, Healing Spring, Healing Checkpoint.\n"}
{"PlotPants": "Wardrobe changes bring variety and color to a show's characters, especially in an animated work where the characters have a default costume that they use all the time. These new clothes accompany downtime in an ongoing story arc, when characters are relaxing, playing or fooling around. However, no matter how welcome costume changes are, they simply can't stay. When the chips are down and the plot gets moving again, our heroes put their Plot Pants back on and get into the action.\nNot to be confused with Magic Pants.\n"}
{"UnblockableAttack": "Some characters are defensive powerhouses, like the Barrier Warrior who raises the use of Deflector Shields into an unassailable art form. One popular tactic for dealing with such a formidable defense is to use an attack that their defenses can't block, an Unblockable Attack. It can be a punch, weapon, or spell that if it connects breaks whatever defenses the target has and leaves them reeling. This attack is so powerful that even a perfectly timed Block/Counter Attack won't work, the only choices the target has are dodging (thus dropping their defense) or preemptively attacking before their assailant finishes their attack.\nThe Unblockable Attack usually has one or more drawbacks to keep it from being naturally overpowering. It may have a Charged Attack mechanic so the defender can potentially survive either by immediately dodging or jabbing very fast to stop the charge-up. Another limitation is it doesn't usually have a lot of Area of Effect or \"splash\" damage, giving the target plenty of space to run to in order to avoid getting hit. Similarly it will not be an Always Accurate Attack that can home in on targets wherever they may be and even if they dodge (in fact, an Always Accurate Attack will probably do less damage as a tradeoff). If the unblockable attack lacks these drawbacks it gives the attacker an \"Instant Death\" Radius that makes the game Nintendo Hard and the opponent akin to a god.\nThe Unblockable Attack is similar to how a spell with No Saving Throw will No-Sell a target's mystic and mental defenses... provided it hits. The difference is that No Saving Throw attacks can be prevented from hitting by certain defenses, while an Unblockable attack can never be intercepted, only avoided or interrupted.\nThis works equally well on actual physical defenses like fists, swords and shields, as well as intangible ones like a Beehive Barrier. The Boss Battle is likely to have this, and Mooks probably have attacks like this to make sure the player doesn't spend all the fight just blocking. The Unblockable Attack is usually signaled with a special animation.\nIn Fighting Games, grapple/throw maneuvers tend to be unblockable as a rule, to encourage a player to use their defenses wisely; it also creates a Tactical Rock\u2013Paper\u2013Scissors where Defend beats Attack, Throw beats Defend, and Attack beats Throw.\nSee also Worf Barrage. Compare Invulnerable Attack and Armor-Piercing Attack.\n"}
{"PlugNPlayFriends": "When a new character permanently joins an ensemble cast, it takes an astonishingly short time for them to get to the same level of rapport with the other characters as they already had with each other (and with the character they're replacing). Expect one Fish out of Water episode, and then they'll be flirting, sharing intimate secrets, in on all the jokes. Can overlap conceptually with Replacement Goldfish, when the new \"fish\" is immediately treated and acts as a beloved friend.\nIn an action series or a video game, they'll be willing to die for everyone else, and vice versa, with a passion nobody ever shows for the one-episode Millstone character. Of course, the outsider status could be resurrected for a one-episode conflict later, or they could turn out to be The Mole. (if so, and the character regrets their actions, they will be Easily Forgiven)\nEspecially jarring in Heel\u2013Face Turn scenarios.\nContrast Forgotten Fallen Friend. See also Remember the New Guy?\n"}

{"ThroughAFacefullOfFur": "Most mammals are covered in fur, most birds in feathers, most reptiles in scales. Thus, if the blood rushes to the animal's skin as a result of effort, anger, embarrassment or pain, it should be covered from view, though if an animal has light-colored, thin fur or feathers, something of the skin tone may still be visible. Some creatures, namely robots, are inorganic, and have no blood with which to blush. However, a remarkable phenomenon takes place in the world of animated beings. There, if a bear burns or drops a hammer on its paw, or a duck is bilked of a million-dollar prize, or a griffin is caught in the shower without a towel on, or a robot is kissed by their crush \u2014 or even if a factory whistle is just blowing too strenuously \u2014 the creature or object will turn bright red \u2014 flesh, fur, feathers, or metal included. This phenomenon is usually restricted to the face, but will on some occasions spread over the whole body.\nA variant reaction may take place when a character is frightened, in which case it may turn yellow or white; or freezing, when it may turn blue; or sick, when it may turn green or yellow or, in extreme cases, patterns of colors such as polka dots or plaid. An animal at any level of the Sliding Scale of Anthropomorphism can sometimes have tanned fur or feathers, which acts like skin.\nSince this is primarily an Animation Trope, humans aren't exempt from it\u2014a character with a very thick beard or mustache may be shown with a visible blush when they logically should not have one.\nThough this is primarily an Animation Trope, being a common feature of Funny Animal Anatomy, it will occasionally show up in other media as well.\nNot to be confused with seeing through a face full of fur; that's Blinding Bangs.\n"}
{"HilariousinHindsight": "\"Funny Aneurysm\" Moment is when events, either external or within a series, turn a joke into something disturbing, upsetting, or at the very least really uncomfortable. Harsher in Hindsight is when a tragic and serious event is even worse later.\nThis is the opposite. It's when a later event, such as a current event or something that happened in the series, is funnier than it originally was. This is what your literature teacher would call \"Life imitating Art\". There's a decent list in this College Humor feature and another one in this Cracked.com feature.note\u00a0As of the end of 2016, the article has become its own ninth example.\nNote this is not merely something that seemingly predicts something else. For example, black US presidents in fictions are not this trope. A black US president in fiction who has an Embarrassing Middle Name would be.\nAlso note that some examples that might not seem funny to one, might seem funny to another. It depends on attitudes towards Black Comedy and Gallows Humor.\nAdditionally, \"hilarious\" doesn't just mean \"BLAH-HAH-HAH! gut-busting,\" either. If you go by the word's original definition, it can mean \"amusing\" or \"charming\" as well. So any belated lighthearted coincidence would fit under this trope.\nAlmost all examples of Have a Gay Old Time are an example of this trope. Some examples of Actor Allusion and/or Role Association are.\nCompare Fridge Brilliance, Heartwarming in Hindsight. Also compare Narm if this happens immediately.\nContrast \"Funny Aneurysm\" Moment (when something that was once amusing or awesome is now tinged with tragedy thanks to a Real Life or in-story tragedy), Dude, Not Funny! (when something is considered in bad taste to mock or even mention, no matter what the circumstance), Hilarious in Flashback (where a glimpse of the characters' past contrasts amusingly with their established personalities and situation), Harsher in Hindsight (when something dramatic or depressing is now worse due to a Real Life or in-story tragedy), Unintentional Period Piece (in the cases where a work that was current when made almost only makes jokes that no current reader can understand) and Two Decades Behind (when the writer thought it was current but wasn't), and finally If It Was Funny the First Time... (in cases where a Running Gag is overused or a joke is only funny once). A \"dated reference\" is when a single joke (or only a handful) in a series is no longer funny because nobody alive remembers why it was funny, but is Not a Trope as it is mostly covered by Unintentional Period Piece and Two Decades Behind.\n"}
{"Transformers": "If you're looking for the live-action movie series, see Transformers Film Series. For the original Generation One animated film, see The Transformers: The Movie. For more information, you might want to consult the Transformers wiki, TFWiki.net. Its informality is similar to that of TV Tropes.A long-running franchise consisting of dozens of toy lines, many Animated Series, quite a few Comic Books, and a series of live-action movies. Reduced to its simplest terms, Transformers is the story of an eons-old battle between two factions of a race of sentient Transforming Mecha, usually called the Autobots and Decepticons, whose battles frequently take them to Earth. Traditionally the Autobots transform into civilian automobiles, while the Decepticons transform into military hardware, though this distinction has grown less obvious over time.Considering its origins as a toy line, the show is highly Merchandise-Driven, each incarnation serving to pimp a line of transforming toys. The original toy line sold in America came about when Hasbro imported several disparate Japanese toy lines, primarily Takara's \"Diaclone\" (launched 1980) and \"Microchange\" lines (the latter part of the larger \"Microman\" toy franchise of 1974-84). The piecemeal origins of the individual toys are largely responsible for the enormous disparity in scale and style of the early toys (the original Optimus Prime, for example, has a cockpit designed to hold a Diaclone action figure, while the original Jetfire's toy is easily recognizable as a Valkyrie from Macross). When brought together as a single toy line, they were given the Transformers brand and established the \"sapient robot\" aspect of the story.After the original toy line, further incarnations were designed specifically for the mega-hit Transformers brand, creating a more internally-consistent style, though still with inappropriate sizes between toys.Recurring character archetypes of note across the various series include:And besides all of these, there are usually other members that fit into the Five-Man Band mold. Of the Autobots there is also usually a Ratchet (The Smart Guy / The Medic), a Jetfire (Heel\u2013Face Turn member), and/or an Ironhide (The Big Guy). For the Decepticons there is often a Soundwave (Evil Genius and/or Flunky Boss), a Shockwave (Wild Card) and/or a Devastator (The Brute).Note: Descriptions here are to be kept brief; for detailed information, see the individual series pages. Please do not apply formatting to the bulleted titles, as this screws up the indexing.The saga that started it all, Generation 1 specifically refers to the base story of the Autobots' and Decepticons' war and their leaders, Optimus Prime and Megatron, crashing on prehistoric Earth. Back on Cybertron, the war came to a very uneasy stalemate because of their missing faction leaders. It isn't until their return that the war begins again. Other than that, between the various series and comics there is little that is consistent.The Beast Era is a break from the usual presentation, featuring Transformers with animal altmodes instead of vehicles, and Maximals and Predacons replacing Autobots and Decepticons. It is in continuity with the Generation 1 family, but the toys and fiction are distinct enough to be considered on their own. Despite being quite different from the original series (and most subsequent Transformers series), the Beast Era is what saved the brand from falling into the abyss to which most other 80's toyline properties fell victim. Beast Wars revitalized the whole franchise.Transformers: Robots in Disguise started the trend of Hasbro creating a new line of Transformers toys and backstory, then rebooting the property with a new continuity about two or three years later; this has caused an explosion of independent continuities in the past decade. However, while RiD was originally intended to be a filler series - as the Japanese did not opt to import the poorly received Beast Machines for several years - it was very successful in western markets, though it was also intended as filler here because the successor line to Beast Machine, dubbed TransTech, was scrapped due to Hasbro's losses from the Star Wars: Episode 1 line and Beast Machines being less successful.The Unicron Trilogy (2002-2006) was the next reboot and was intended as a full saga with an expansive toy line. It featured three anime series that were dubbed into English (with varying degrees of quality) and aired on Cartoon Network. Each sub-series to the trilogy had a 'gimmick' that was always in the limelight.The gimmicks for Armada toys were the Mini-Cons, micro-transformers who would activate lights, sounds and/or hidden weapons by plugging into the larger toys. Energon toys were \"Powerlinxing\" where every transformer of a certain size class could combine with another. Cybertron toys had \"Cyber Keys\" which were similar in function to to the Mini-Con gimmick. The general disinterest shown in these gimmicks by the fans has led to a reduced prominence in later toy lines, focusing more on what features they can do with the actual transformation instead.Of note is that Cybertron was not intended as a sequel to Energon; the original Japanese Transformers: Galaxy Force took place in its own universe. Hasbro designer Aaron Archer had intended it to continue the earlier shows, so this is a case of conflicting sources. Interestingly enough, recent material released in Japan seems to have retconned Galaxy Force into the same universe as Armada and Energon.A live-action film franchise, each directed by Michael Bay, and plenty of expanded universe comic books. Initially given a detractor nickname of \"Bayformers\" (via inaccurate claims of it being In Name Only), it has come to general fan vernacular. Highly divisive between fans, critics and general moviegoers, they have been extremely popular financially and lead to a resurgence of the brand that hadn't been seen since its inception.In addition to the movies, many other projects based on the movie-incarnation have been made.IDW has done prequels, adaptations, and sequel comics for the movies. Titan Magazines also does a series based on the movie, with issues that fit around IDW's, much as Marvel UK did for Marvel US.A new continuity and a dramatic new art style highlights this series. It is largely a throwback to the classic G1 while cementing a stronger canon and taking influence from newer series. This series ended up returning the franchise to its roots, being American produced with no dramatic changes to the core story and not trying to highlight any new toy gimmick (instead focusing on the transformation itself as the gimmick).Fun Publications has introduced multiple continuities of their own for the official fan club and conventions. These continuities are not very prominent compared to the others due to their relative inaccessibility, their stories mostly having only been released to convention attendees and fan club members.The Transformers Aligned Universe is meant to establish a definitive multi-medium continuity for Transformers by cherry-picking the best aspects of past iterations of the franchise. It launched in 2010 with the video game Transformers: War for Cybertron and the corresponding Exodus book. The intention behind this set-up is to create a longer-lasting Alternate Continuity than the frequent reboots every few years in the 2000's.After the Transformers franchise began releasing the Lego-like Kre-O construction sets, these have also began to develop their own fiction, and just like the sets are based on several iterations of the franchise, the fiction also bases its stories on a mix-and-match of versions, with a humorous touch.Several times, Hasbro has attempted to put transforming toys related to other lines under the Transformers umbrella. It didn't work out so well for the Animorphs, but the Marvel Universe and Star Wars ones have been better received. Takara also has gotten in on this, with the Disney Label (yeah, we dunno what possesed Takara either).A scene change gimmick from G1 is a faction symbol wipe, if switching to the Decepticons to the Autobots the symbol will flip from Autobot to Decepticon, but it can also flip from Autobot to Autobot (for another Autobot scene) or Decepticon to Decepticon. Some incarnations have used a similar eye-catch and it has been parodied in many instances in modern media."}

It's precisely because these characters are the fools and tools of fate that they are uniquely placed to derail these schemes with the gentleness of a butterfly flapping its wings... of doom!\nPut another way, they are an author's walking deconstruction or Lampshade Hanging of the Theory of Narrative Causality: just as easily as a plot can come together, it can be pulled apart with the tiniest, most ridiculous things.\nThese characters are The Chessmaster, Smug Snake, Manipulative Bastard, and Magnificent Bastard's worst nightmare, and the bane of many a Clock King.\nWhen the character ruins a protagonist's plans by unknowingly doing something small but crucial, he becomes an Unwitting Instigator of Doom. When the Spanner can trigger a series of coincidences, it's Disaster Dominoes. When the plan is screwed and the character is also aware that he will screw the plan, and doesn't care, he becomes a Leeroy Jenkins. Occasionally, may be Mistaken for Badass.

Compare with Out-Gambitted, where someone's plan is successful but ineffective against a better-thought-out plan.

See also Didn't See That Coming, The Dog Bites Back, Who's Laughing Now?\nThe trope is reputedly named for the Industrial Revolution-era practice of disgruntled workers throwing a spanner into a machine, either because of fears machines would put them out of work, or as a bargaining chip for better working conditions (and often because they were the only ones who knew how to repair the machines as well).\n(Note for Americans reading this: \"Spanner\" is the Queen's English word for what you would call a \"wrench\", with the added benefit of it being slang for a stupid person.

{"DarkerandEdgier": "A Tone Shift that seeks to make a work of fiction more serious, cynical or gritty.\nIn theory, this means that archetypes which we are accustomed to see acting in a more noble setting will have to act in one where they must think and act grimly in order to make progress, thus forcing re-examination of the tropes involved, or the use of new tropes and expansion of the setting, utilizing different sorts of characters and stories. In practice, however, writers can be too lazy to realize all that potential and end up randomly \"spicing up\" a work with gratuitous gore, cursing, and sex to make it more \"adult\" \u2014 often overdoing it in the process. This is not to be confused with Tough Love.\nWhen done right, Darker and Edgier works are a case of Tropes Are Not Bad. When a show uses this trope as a tagline, you can expect a mixture of: awful things happening to the characters, twisted backstories giving them a reason to angst, good and bad becoming less obvious, and the setting becoming much bleaker. However, this all works IF it's done right.\nAs one could predict, this is fairly easy to screw up and poor use of these tropes may just result in Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy if the setting gets too depressing or Narm if the edginess becomes just silly. This doesn't make it a bad trope though\u2014 when this is used subtly such as in the Harry Potter series it can create the effect of a series growing up with its audience.\nIn fact this is often the purpose of a Darker and Edgier turn. Just as a Lighter and Softer tone is typically part of an attempt to bring a fictional world to children or to younger children, a \"darker\" tone is often intended to make a setting appeal to older children or adults. But unlike its opposite, a Darker And Edgier shift is often intended not to reach a new audience, but rather to keep an existing audience as it grows up. It can also be a result of child fans growing up, Running the Asylum as Promoted Fanboys, and continuing to think of the setting as something aimed at themselves and their peers instead of the original target age group.\nThis trope became extremely popular in Comic Books as a rebellion against the Silver Age but also led to more than a decade of clumsy attempts to show that comics are \"not kid stuff anymore.\" See the Bronze Age, the Dark Age, and '90s Anti-Hero for more details about how this worked.\nThe excessive version is often known as \"Grimdark\" (one word), derived from the tagline of Warhammer 40,000. (\"In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.\") Sometimes justified with the phrase \"Silly Rabbit, Idealism Is for Kids!\". Usually shows up in Dark Fic. If a pre-existing show undergoes a Retool under the guise of making things Darker And Edgier, expect Jumping the Shark, especially if there was Executive Meddling involved. The United Federation of Charles wrote an essay called, What is Grimdark? which explains some of the history of the subject. \"Grimderp\" has in many parts of the Net become popular as a term for Grimdark that goes so far that it becomes Narm. When a specific character rather than the work as a whole is perceived as having become excessively Darker And Edgier, a popular term is \"Edgelord\". Which also gets applied to fanfic writers who produce exclusively Grimdark (or especially Grimderp) works. Future writers beware! Using this trope without knowing when to stop is a quick road to Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy.\nAs with Lighter and Softer, this practice tends to go better if the change was planned in advance to keep the tone from shifting too abruptly.\nNote that this is not the same as a Deconstruction. A Deconstruction plays out the genre's conventions to their logical conclusions in order to criticize the initial genre conventions. This does not have to be dark (see for instance Deconstructive Parody) and it doesn't prevent things from turning out well. Darker And Edgier just adds \"dark\" elements to try and get the same effect. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but often a Deconstruction can cause a work to seem darker because it's calling attention to dark aspects already implied but previously glossed over; see also Ascended Fridge Horror.\nOpposite of Lighter and Softer, Younger and Hipper, Denser and Wackier and Revisiting the Roots. Often found alongside Bloodier and Gorier, Hotter and Sexier, Obligatory Swearing, Sequel Logo in Ruins, and Real Is Brown. Often a by-product of the franchise growing bigger and more epic.\nCompare Grimmification and Fractured Fairy Tale for when this is done with fairy tales and American Kirby Is Hardcore for when this is done with boxart. See also Sugar Apocalypse, and Cerebus Syndrome. For when it applies to a single episode, see Unexpectedly Dark Episode.\n"}
{"ParanormalMundaneItem": "Items with mystical properties are commonly assumed to look antiquated, bearing associations with ancient civilizations, the Middle Ages or some other time period no later than late 19th-early 20th century. Common examples are magical staffs, manuscripts, mirrors, potions, etc. This trope instead is about paranormal items that look like they were bought in a shop nearby. They are usually labeled with either an unfamiliar trademark or a familiar trademark with a strangely altered label. For example, it may be a chocolate bar which would transform you into a monster if you eat it or a video game cartridge that would teleport you into the game's realm as soon as you put it into your console.\nSuch items can often be found in Urban Fantasy. They may be used by a Blue-Collar Warlock, and are frequently sold in a Little Shop That Wasnt There Yesterday. Often overlaps with May Contain Evil, in which case they may be a Cursed Item; also compare Haunted Technology.\n"}
{"SkullCups": "When a fierce, trophy-collecting warrior wants to be practical, he won't just make the remains of his enemies into a fetish. He'll make them into something useful. Like a cup.\nIf you want to make somebody threatening or as a sure sign of villainy, this is a way to suggest that a person is so cold they are unaffected by drinking from the remains of their dead enemies, as well as it being a grand form of humiliation and a warning to other foes. The use of someone's skull as such may also be a threat used during a Badass Boast.\nThe beverage in question may be blood, but is typically wine or some sort of elixir that may necessarily need to be imbibed from an enemy's skull. Other situations in which this trope commonly occurs include proposing a toast to the defeat of the enemy in question or intentionally wrong Shakespeare parodies.\nDrinking or eating brains from a skull is a different thing. Compare Creepy Souvenir.\n"}
{"StarStruckSpeechless": "This trope occurs when someone average has a run in with someone of a higher social status - such as a celebrity, royalty or a similar government position, or even just someone this person admires greatly. The ordinary person, in attempting to speak with them, can do nothing but stutter, stumble over their words, and say the completely wrong thing, purely out of being so nervous or in shock.\nIt can be quite the embarrassing moment for the average person, especially if they wind up completely humiliating themself in the process. The person of status, if they're a snob, might find this particularly amusing or, alternatively, disgraceful; if they're a nice person, however, they're much more likely to sympathize, or to try and help the person feel more comfortable in the conversation.\nThe important person may be a King Incognito, in which case the cause for surprise is finding out their true identity. This may also be caused by a Celeb Crush.\nCompare Cannot Spit It Out, Emotionally Tongue-Tied, and I'm Your Biggest Fan. If this is a hero meeting their idol, it's The Knights Who Say \"Squee!\".\n"}
{"ProudWarriorRaceGuys": "A specific subtrope of Blood Knight, the Proud Warrior Race Guy seeks battle and bloodshed because his culture teaches that doing so is the greatest source of personal honor and glory. This Proud Warrior Race will often be based on one of several real world cultures who are perceived to have acted this way, such as the Samurai, Spartans, Vikings, and Mongols. They are often a Martyrdom Culture. The Proud Warrior Race Guy is almost always a hero. If evil, he will probably be the Worthy Opponent.\n\"Proud\", in this case, often means \"Psychopathically Violent\". Critiques of this position will be met with: \"You do not understand\". May occasionally overlap with the Always Chaotic Evil race, though the two are usually differentiated by the Proud Warrior having a strict Code of Honor (which may include paying debts, loyalty to companions and officers, and fighting with honor), while the Chaotic Evil race has no real rules and does cowardly or underhanded things. If the Code of Honor is too alien for humans to understand, or too xenophobic to allow cooperation, then the heroes will treat the two groups as the same. The better sort of Code of Honor will enforce Would Not Shoot a Civilian, although often because civilians are dismissed as too weak and cowardly to be good fighters, and so they get passed over in the search for worthy enemies.\nWhile most commonly seen in science fiction programs in the guise of Rubber-Forehead Aliens, the Proud Warrior Race Guy is not limited to that genre. Consider Hawk in Spenser For Hire, B.A. in The A-Team, and Tonto in The Lone Ranger or Kato in The Green Hornet. This trope currently tends to be limited to SF because applying it to human races really skirts the bounds of current racial sensitivities. You don't see a lot of the Noble Savage anymore either, except as alien races, for the same reason.\nSpecies that are essentially aliens based on predatory animals, such as the Cat Folk often found in many Science Fiction works, are also apt to be of this type. A similar variant to this might be a Proud Hunter Race Guy, such as the Predator.\nA variation on this is the Proud Soldier Race \u2013 a more low-key version more like the modern military rather than a warrior culture, with more focus on drilling and discipline than just strength at arms. These guys have a tendency to be more technologically advanced and more focused on expansion than conquest \u2013 they don't see the harm in dishonorable tactics, but they're pragmatic, not ruthless; The Proud Soldier Race Guy isn't likely to cause any more harm than absolutely necessary to get what he wants.\nThere are, in fact, a number of Humans Through Alien Eyes-type works where humans are the Proud Warrior Race (there is also a significant portion of these works in which the aliens see us that way, regardless of whether or not it's actually true).\nSee also Blood Knight and Barbarian Tribe. See Warrior Poet for what happens when the Proud Warrior Race Guy becomes more developed. Often is fond of being In Harm's Way, and is a Glory Seeker wanting to be Famed In-Story. They often are of the mistaken belief that this means they have a Badass Army, but often are proven wrong. May be from a Martyrdom Culture. Frequently crossed with or has strong elements of the Noble Savage. Being a culture singularly focused on the warrior way, anyone performing non-warrior roles frequently suffer from Klingon Scientists Get No Respect. If they manage to conquer another nation, can become members of a Foreign Ruling Class.\nAlso compare Proud Scholar Race Guy and Proud Merchant Race for different kinds of hats a species can wear.\nIf humanity is portrayed as the Proud Warrior Race, it's Humans Are Warriors.\n"}
{"RelationshipCeiling": "The level, or perceived stagnation therein, of the relationship of characters. The Relationship Ceiling can create the illusion of disinterest in the progression, or just writing, of a relationship when in fact it's due to pure design choices. Figuring out the kind of Relationship Ceiling characters have is often a good measure of how probable a future Relationship Upgrade is. While these ceilings have some basis in reflecting reality, the very noticeable ones are often artificial constructs and the rules governing them tend to hold well over very different scenarios.\nCeilings prevent relationships from developing past the direct relatability of the audience. Regardless of the age or makeup of the cast, relationships portrayed with any depth generally reflect those the audience is familiar with. For these reasons, shows marketed to kids generally avoid romance entirely because of lack of audience interest. For example, in shounen a female co-star is involved in the Serious Business of the story rather than treated as a romantic prospect, generally remaining a friend even if she would want otherwise. Shows for teenagers generally end up with rather shallow romances regardless of the implied deepness, maturity, or importance of it because they emulate (relatable) teenage romances.\nCeilings mark the point where progress would majorly disturb the status quo. This is anathema to long-running stories, so writers will generally avoid them unless they are prepared to modify the story as well. However, prominent but meaningless changes do not break the ceiling. True upgrades are rare and many steps never actually affect the writer's ability to tell a specific story. For example, lovers who marry may break a ceiling while lovers who get engaged do not; the latter only predicts a potential event, is easily reversible and ultimately is just a version of the original. Similarly, lovers who cohabitate may replicate a marriage (or at least marriage-like plotlines) well enough an actual marriage is unnecessary and pointless.\nCeilings are common in subordinate media adaptations of a media property, leaving any major changes for the primary medium for the property to address. For instance, in TV series versions of ongoing feature film series, they sometimes set between films. So, the TV series version can hint at certain things developing, but any major developments are reserved for the feature films to deal with such as Po and Tigress' relationship in the Kung Fu Panda film series, or Hiccup and Astrid in How to Train Your Dragon.\nOccasionally, writers have the foresight to bring in a new outside character to break the ceiling. However, if this is the primary reason for the character to exist, they often devolve into a Satellite Character.\nBecause breaking a Relationship Ceiling is a common Jump the Shark moment, writers may backpedal with a Toilet Seat Divorce or a One More Day situation. To avoid this problem, writers will often save breaking the Relationship Ceiling for the Grand Finale resulting in a Last Minute Hookup to reward viewers with an intimate relationship without having to worry about viewers losing interest after the Relationship Ceiling is broken.\nSee also, True Love Is Boring. Usually a cause of Relationship Writing Fumble.\n"}
{"HerosFirstRescue": "A newly super-powered person sees a burning building on TV. He realizes that he can do something to save the people on the top floor. He rushes to the scene and performs the daring rescue. It usually happens at the close of the First Act of a Super Hero's origin story. In the beginning of the Second Act, and sometimes even the next scene, the hero will have donned his signature costume.\nThe superhero version is a turning point, so it doesn't apply to rescue personnel performing their already chosen profession, like firefighters or police. Similarly, established superheroes doing this as a matter of course don't count. The heroic decision has to happen onscreen for it to be a part of this trope.\nAlthough the first paragraph of this trope description refers to a burning building, it could easily be any other sort of natural disaster, accident or incident. At this point in the story, though, there will not be any archvillains yet. In fact, it's conspicuous in deconstructive settings if it is a burning building; the magnitude of the primary hazards of conflagration, namely smoke inhalation and heat, are generally underplayed in media.\nThis is a subtrope of the Call to Adventure and Heroic Fire Rescue, and what often follows for the Super Heroes is an On Patrol Montage. If a character does this and is not a superhero, then they are showing their heroic nature via a Heroic Fire Rescue and belong there instead.\n"}
{"MusicToInvadePolandTo": "Art produced in Germany has had a startling tendency to be viewed by non-Germans through the prism of is this Nazism or not? This especially applies to German music. And, indeed, to any music that \"sounds German\" regardless of whether or not it was made in Germany.\nMusic To Invade Poland To refers to any music that gets accused of being Nazi because it sounds \"Germanic,\" \"Teutonic,\" \"Wagnerian,\" or the like.\nFor the most part, this stuff does not advocate National Socialism. Unfortunately, the use of bombastic, dramatic, \"Germanic-sounding\" Orchestral Bombing as soundtracks in World War II films has cemented the association between grandiose, orchestral marching music set to relatively steady tempos with authoritarian and warmongering political movements.\nThis is not yet a Discredited Trope. The Trope Namer is a particularly infamous review of Rammstein's album Mutter; the review described the album as \"Music To Invade Poland To\" (although Rammstein, who are a bunch of lefties from the former East Germany, have nothing to do with neo-Nazism, unlike real neo-Nazi bands like the infamous, supposedly reformed \"B\u00f6hse Onkelz\" do). This trope is actually very common in Germany to this day, where it isn't even limited to music. Pretty much everything that could invoke similar associations creates the same feeling of unease with most Germans.\nNot to be confused with Loud of War. May be associated with Germanic Depressives.\nActual military music from the Third Reich tends to be banal and uninspiring (e.g. Der Panzerlied (SFW), a chirpy little ditty featured in Battle of the Bulge), and was more often than not intended to be sung while... you know, actually invading Poland...\nIncidentally, German music earlier came under attack during the anti-German hysteria of World War I. A generation before it became \"Music to Invade Poland To\", German music was denounced as \"Music to Invade Belgium To\".\n"}
{"OneCurseLimit": "When a world's rules state you can't curse someone who's already cursed.\nThis trope centers on situations where an attempt to cause Standard Status Effects fails because the intended victim is already being affected by something. It could be the same effect from a different source or else the fact that they were hit by something separate previously is preventing a new effect from working.\nNot to be confused with Acquired Poison Immunity, in which a character is resistant to a poison or effect because they'd been affected by it previously and recovered. This trope is when an attempt at poison outright fails because they're currently affected by something else. Bonus points if the current curse is useful in the first place.\nThis sometimes overlaps with Hybrid Overkill Avoidance if the curse would turn the character into a monster (for example, vampires can't be cursed with lycanthropy and vice versa). In cases where the resistance is caused by being diseased, this overlaps with Beneficial Disease. See also Disability Immunity, which this can be a sub- or Sister Trope to.\nNot to be confused with only allowing one swear word in a work. Compare Curse That Cures, when a curse cures a character of an existing illness or injury.\n"}
{"CatSuit": "During any infiltration or stealth operation, the female lead will wear an impossibly tight catsuit. It's almost always black, may be shiny leather or latex. It's never a camo pattern or even mottled, and it can't have pockets except for a utility belt and/or gun holster. There will often be a single zipper on the front, which will result in Absolute Cleavage when it's unzipped. The suit will frequently be accompanied by ridiculously high heels. If you see someone in one of these, there's little she can say to convince you she's not a spy or a fetishist outside of a Sci-Fi series.\nThe writers may try to justify it, saying it's a stealth garment with sensor defeating properties\u2014so she's seductively slathered herself in Applied Phlebotinum. It could be for freedom of movement (a Critical Research Failure if the outfit is leather). It could be that she just swam up to the facility and can't ditch the wetsuit. In reality, it's to make the inevitable climbing, shimmying, flipping and belly-crawling through a Laser Hallway look that much more like a lapdance. Of course, it might also be a deliberate invocation of Distracted by the Sexy and I Have Boobs, You Must Obey! against male guards/suspicious people she might encounter.\nShows up in most Spy Drama shows. Any action show that puts a female character through an infiltration scene will use it. Mostly used with at least a wink these days.\nOften extremely shiny, with vertical lines that accentuate the lady's...assets, against all logic.\nPopular variations:\nAs you may have imagined, this is not something real-life (or realistic fictional) female operatives would wear in the field, though a black turtleneck and cargo pants arguably pull off a similar look while being a bit more plausible. In fact, this trope originated not with spy fiction at all, but with Catwoman, whose iconic use of this outfit is both the Trope Creator and Trope Namer. A variant on this is the tendency of female ninja in anime and superhero comics to wear excessively stripperiffic outfits (see for example the female teachers from Naruto).\nSee also Superheroes Wear Tights, Form-Fitting Wardrobe, Impossibly Cool Clothes, Sensual Spandex.\n"}
{"Nanobots": "In Latin, nanus means \"dwarf.\" In science, the prefix nano- means \"one billionth\" of something. Nanotechnology is technology on a scale of 1-100 nanometers (1 nanometer being one billionth of a meter).\nNanotechnology has become an all-purpose magic substitute for soft science fiction and sci-fi-flavored fantasy. Nano is the latest Sci Fi Name Buzzword; it is the new pseudo-Greek for phlebotinum. Nanotech supplies a myriad of exciting powers with a satisfying patina of plausibility.\nIn an apparent contradiction, nanotechnology leads to interesting plots and settings in hard science fiction. If one could make a tiny robot at the nanometer scalenote\u00a0A hydrogen atom is about 0.1 nanometers across, visible light has a wavelength of 400-800 nanometers and a human hair is about 100,000 nanometers wide and that little robot created another, and those two robots made four...\nOnce you have a vast mass of these robots, all ready to accept orders and shuffle stuff around at the molecular level, they can potentially do anything nature does and much, much more. Real-life nanomachine research is being done in areas such as medicine, manufacturing, and chemical engineering.\nMore often fiction delights in taking nanotech way, way beyond the plausible. Nanomachines, \"nanites\" or \"nanobots\" are a writer's best friend. Writers are not expected to show the nanomachines doing whatever it is that they do, all they have to do are the results. And the results can be anything. Nanomachines can be depicted as masses of cloud/liquid in external \"colonies\", Voluntary Shapeshifting Blobs, or syringes of stuff to be injected into humans and have fantastic results, usually in the form of superpowers, but sometimes in the form of a Baleful Polymorph or Harmful Healing.\nNote that real-life physics puts constraints on what nanomachines could accomplish; for instance, without some source of energy, they will just sit there being molecules, or at best work veeeery slowly using ambient energy. There's also the so-called \"sticky fingers\" problem that quantum-sized particles simply don't act like macroscopic matter, such that simply picking them up, moving them, and (most of all) putting them down again is a much, much thornier problem than is popularly understood. But most writers rarely study the subject in any detail; it's easier to just use them as Green Rocks that can do anything the plot requires.\nOne reasonably common science-fiction scenario involves nanomachines being programmed to build copies of themselves using materials in their environment. If not stopped, such nanobots could theoretically grow exponentially, turning all available material on Earth into more nanobots and ending life as we know it \u2014 this is known as the \"Grey Goo\" scenario. Some scientists have expressed concern that this scenario could actually happen in real life, although most consider it extremely unlikely to be accidentally built.\nBecause it is so powerful, in settings where science is inherently bad, expect nanotech to be way up there on the Scale of Scientific Sins.\nNanotech is a fairly common cause for the drastic scenario called The Singularity. The concepts of supply and demand change utterly when humanity becomes capable of mass-producing machinery that can turn anything into anything, ensuring supply is as close to infinite as is possible. And our basic nature is thrown up into the air once we direct nanites to work on us.\nNanites themselves will usually either be dumb as bricks, or networked into a fully sentient mass. Some works may invoke Mechanical Evolution to make the nanomachines smarter/better/deadlier.\nAn important note, though: While many of the listed examples, and indeed fiction in general, may lead you to think otherwise, nanotechnology does not only involve Nanomachines. It's actually a lot broader than that, and several applications don't actually need nanomachines to be realized (though nanomachine usage would certainly improve them considerably).\n"}
{"RedMage": "The \"player class\" family tree is a large, branching kudzu with enough arms to print several dozen sourcebooks. One such branch is The Red Mage, a magician capable of casting spells from two different or even mutually exclusive schools of magic. Much like a magical Jack-of-All-Stats, this cousin to the Magic Knight fuses two otherwise inimical capabilities and gains strength from both... while mastering neither, and perhaps even gaining both their weaknesses!\nTheatrics and balance issues aside, the true wonder and claim to fame of the Red Mage is that they are talented, open minded, and have trained in a way that allows them to understand and become able practitioners in two fundamentally different forms of magic. Think about it this way: they are the fantasy equivalent of a Renaissance Man or Omnidisciplinary Scientist, skilled multi-disciplinarians of already complex and taxing fields. While some mages scoff at different forms of magic, the Red Mage takes the time to study them, and by learning them becomes truly versatile.\nIt's not often a single magic user can pull off a Yin-Yang Bomb, after all.\nThe most common form of Red Mage combines White Mage and Black Mage with a hint of Glass Cannon/Squishy Wizard. In rare cases, they may also be as physically gifted as a Magic Knight or Combat Medic. However, the Red Mage isn't just a swordsperson who picks one school of magic to go with their blade, but just about any two (and sometimes more) schools of magic. Common pairings include: White Magic and Black Magic, Light and Dark, or Fire and Ice (and occasionally another Elemental Power).\nContrast Crippling Overspecialization and Master of One Magic. See also Class and Level System and Splat. May suffer (and benefit) doubly from Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards. To avoid confusion, the Red Mage may well be a single class with access to spells from different classes, or the result of a magician who has studied in more than one magical tradition. Compare Hybrid Monster and Hybrid Overkill Avoidance.\n"}
{"FanCommunityNicknames": "Many fanbases on TV have their own nicknames. Some are generated by themselves, some from observers and some from detractors.\nBe advised when using these terms that by the time the name becomes well known to outsiders, it's often gathered some distaste by those within the fandom. \"Trekkie\" has reached universal status and even appears in reputable dictionaries, but many within Star Trek fandom only ever use the term derisively, preferring the term \"Trekker\". Likewise, \"Whovian\" comes primarily from US Public Television \u2014 it was originated by, and for some time a trademark of, the Doctor Who Fan Club of America \u2014 and many fans outside the US think it sounds a bit silly, preferring the considerably more baroque but less jargonish \"fans of the programme\".\nThis has really picked up with the introduction of The Internet, because fans can interact with each other on Fora and such. 4chan and its derivatives have a common template for such terms: Just take the name or premise of the show and add \"-fag\" after it... (e.g. Sonicfags, Pok\u00e9fags, Ponyfags, etc.) ... as suffixes attributed to their Fan Dumb.\nA subtrope of Fan Nickname, but not to be confused with it.\nSee also Estrogen Brigade and Testosterone Brigade.\n"}
{"StupidSexyFriend": "Sometimes a character really does want to just be friends with another; at least as far as conscious decisions go, but the sexual attraction and sexual thoughts persist.\nMaybe something about the friend, whether appearance or personality or whatever else, just seems sexy. Perhaps the character is so dirty-minded by their very nature that they just have sexual thoughts anyway. Whatever the case, the lust conflicts with the friendship, no matter how hard they try to conceal the former.\nCompare and contrast with I Don't Want to Ruin Our Friendship. The difference lies in the reaction of the character feeling the romantic/sexual feelings (and, in many cases, the former relationship between the two): if they're creeped out by their sudden attraction to the person they had always considered a brother/sister, it's this trope; if they're worried that admitting their feelings to someone with whom they've been Just Friends will cause drama or change a group dynamic, it's I Don't Want to Ruin Our Friendship.\nCompare Stupid Sexy Flanders, as it reflects on a similar conflict between the sexual thoughts one has and consciously thinking one shouldn't have such sexual thoughts. (And yes, this is snowcloned from it.) Compare and contrast Friends with Benefits, one solution to this problem if it's mutual.\nTruth in Television, of course. After all, it's considered normal to lust after someone you don't know, as opposed to a close friend (that you do know).\n"}
{"NecroCam": "Commonly used in crime dramas.\nOnce the detective has done The Summation and revealed the guilty party, we will get a Flashback of the crime being committed with the perpetrator completely visible, showing how they did it. This is particularly helpful if the murder method was fairly complicated, as a picture is of course worth a thousand words.\nSometimes there will be more than one flashback during the investigation as the detectives think out a theory; in this case, the theories and therefore the flashback may not even turn out to be correct. Sometimes it will be blurred with distorted sound and washed-out colors.\nCompare Once More, with Clarity! which repeats an earlier scene but adds new information which changes our perception of what went on in that moment. Nothing to do with Necromancy.\n"}
{"FictionalZodiac": "Sometimes Western and Eastern zodiacs and the Druidic Tree Birth Signs just don't cut it. Inventing new zodiac and horoscope systems is a nice way to add depth to a world different from ours, and a completely new birth sign/horoscope system can be used to give a basis for foreign myths and superstitions.\nOften they would be related to Constellations, an elemental system, Animal and Mythical Motifs or other themes. As the Western Zodiac as the basics of astrology fictional deviations would be used to inform character traits be connected to destiny. However it is just as likely that they are just parodying those concepts and not take them seriously. Regardless of which, 12 would be the most common number for the signs, as both Eastern and Western variants have themnote\u00a0However a variation of the Western Zodiac has a 13th sign based on Ophucius, and the Eastern Zodiac is not even related to the months, its amount of signs was a mere coincidence.\nCompare Constellations, Eastern Zodiac and Western Zodiac.\n"}
{"OffhandBackHand": "Being a Mook is a hard (and short) life. If you're not constantly getting killed, you're getting knocked out by the Hero.\nSome Mooks, instead of following the rules of Mook Chivalry, try getting smart by sneaking up on the hero when he's busy fighting another fellow Mook or while in conversation with someone, and striking him from behind.\nSounds easy, right? He's not even looking your way, throwing punches or talking. All you have to do is be silent... just a little closer...\nNope, not only do you still get knocked out (or shot down), the Hero doesn't even give you the courtesy of looking your way first. And of course, you just made him look that much cooler.\nCompare Foe-Tossing Charge, only even more humiliating for the poor sap on the receiving end. Very commonly featured in a work that is Rated M for Manly. Users of this move tend to have a Badass Back. There is a certain amount of Truth in Television to this: The reverse kick is a fairly viable move. Doesn't mean a flippant Backhanded Apology. See also Excuse Me While I Multitask.\n"}
{"LonerTurnedFriend": "So you got yourself a character in a series who's a bit of a lone wolf. They fight (and even win) their own battles, they reject being a part of the hero's group, and they may even rebuff their friendliness. More importantly, they may even enjoy being by themselves no matter what society tells them.\nAnd later on in the series, the character is now the newest member of the band of friends. How so? There could be two common reasons for this sudden Character Development. One, it could be that they got tired of being alone for a very long time considering that there are heavy consequences of being a loner for too long. They may have realized they long for companionship after all, despite being unfairly mistreated for being different. Another could be that they may have been inspired by the All-Loving Hero's heartwarming speech about The Power of Friendship or that the character learns An Aesop about accepting others' friendships even if they were initially dismissive of them.\nSometimes, this trope can play the character in two ways. One, they still retain their introverted characteristics, but are considered a loyal teammate/friend to the group. Two, they are a permanent member of the team and show no hint of introversion.\nNote that this trope doesn't always have be about a character joining The Hero's group. It can also apply to The Protagonist of the series, too, particularly the Anti-Hero. A group of characters will become drawn by the hero without them knowing it and they will be dismissive at first, but later on, they accept them into their life.\nThis is usually part of the introduction for The Lancer, or the Sixth Ranger, or a Sixth Ranger that eventually evolves into The Lancer.\nCompare Default to Good and Neutral No Longer which is mainly about choosing an alignment in a setting of Black and White Morality, while this trope focuses on solitary and asocial characters becoming friends with people. Compare Can't Live With Them, Can't Live Without Them if the character grows accustomed to another character's presence. Loony Friends Improve Your Personality may enforce this trope. Related to Friendless Background.\n"}
{"WeaselWords": "Weasel Words are about words or phrases that imply more than they actually mean. Taken at face value, they don't say much at all, or are just not impressive. However, the way they're used imply there's substance to them, that they mean something.\nThis is one reason they're a common feature of advertising, both on television and elsewhere: companies can imply that products or offers are better than they actually are without getting into legal trouble for lying about it. For instance, \"part of this complete breakfast\" doesn't mean the product itself completes the breakfast, but the implication is that it does.\nFor an extensive and detailed examination of Weasel Words, see this entry at Wikipedia. Or, better yet, see this entry! Some people say that weasel words are a necessary generalisation. TV Tropes editor Sockatume believes that if you know who's saying something, you should mention it.\nDo you see what we did there?\nFor one form of weasel words we don't want around here, see Examples Are Not Arguable. As an interesting note the term is called that not to imply weasels are inherently evil somehow. but rather in reference to how they eat eggs by sucking the insides out and only make a small hole, meaning an egg they have sucked may appear to be intact until someone looks at it more closely, in the same way weasel words suck the meaning out of a statement without being immediately obvious.\n"}
{"SpinOffSpring": "When, rather than using Spin-Off Babies (the main characters of an older series being made younger) you instead make a show about the descendants of people from the original premise.

{"TributeToFido": "Most people love animals, especially their pets. Some authors may even put some sort of reference to a real-life animal in their work. Most often, it will be their own pet, either as a memorial or just because they love him that much.\nIt may be just the animal's name, similar to the human equivalent, Tuckerization. This is justified in a film if the pet themselves is playing the pet named after them; after all, it's much easier to get an animal to respond to its own name. The whole animal, not just the name, may be put into the work as well. Or, perhaps, they based an animal character off a real-life one, such as its appearance or mannerisms, even if they didn't use the name.\n"}
{"PinkIsForSissies": "The idea in fiction that a male character, when wearing pink, actively manages to lose a great deal of his more masculine qualities, or is accused of being gay. This results not just in other people making snarky and rude remarks to him, but may actually result in distinct changes in his character.\nTomboys may also object to this color because it's girlish. As can women who think it's childish.\nThe trope is the reason Real Men Wear Pink is named so. When women are seen as sissies for wearing pink, it also fits into Real Women Don't Wear Dresses.\nA Sub-Trope of Pink Means Feminine.\nSee also Pink Girl, Blue Boy.\n"}
{"RightlySelfRighteous": "So let's say we have a character who comes across as extremely self-righteous, touting his or her moral standing as above that of most others. Surely someone so self-righteous ought to just be projecting his or her faults or sins onto everyone else, right? Surely if we look closely enough we could find out that this character is a hypocrite of some sort or least not as virtuous as he or she thinks they are...\nNope. This character sees himself or herself morally superior because he or she actually is. Such portrayals do not require the good-does-not-call-itself-good approach either; to the contrary, it requires good to be blunt about it, because Good Is Not Nice, and if others do not like this Brutal Honesty, it must be because the moral fallings of others reduce their appreciation for it.\nBasically, the Rightly Self Righteous are to morality as the Insufferable Genius is to intelligence.\nIf there's a race who hold this trait, it's Can't Argue with Elves. Compare Well, Excuse Me, Princess! Multiple Closer to Earth relationships are conveyed this way.\nIf they are The Protagonist the author intends for them to be truly morally superior but comes off as pompousness or truly insufferable, then Designated Hero is the result (otherwise, they're just an insufferable character). This can also be the case if they have hypocritical shades that go unnoticed. It can also overlap into Jerkass Has a Point.\nIn most cases, no matter how consistent they are to this trope, you can expect them to fall off their high horse at least once. After all stories can only go so long without Breaking The Haughty.\nContrast Small Name, Big Ego, Know-Nothing Know-It-All and Hypocrite for characters who similarly believe they are a bastion of goodness, but are usually just full of hot air (naturally it is possible for examples to merge into these cases, especially if they are badly written). Compare Good Is Not Nice where a character is good in spite of their meanness whereas this trope is where a character is good because of their meanness. Compare also The Extremist Was Right. This may lead the character in being Unintentionally Unsympathetic. Sheep in Sheep's Clothing is likewise for \"good\" characters who are actually good - but who are much more sympathetic.\n"}
{"DivertingPower": "According to Tim Taylor Technology, all you need to do to enhance a system is pump more power into it. But where do you get that power?\nDiverting Power is what happens when Tim Taylor Technology runs into a limited pool of power. If the extra power to pump into something is not readily available, that power must be reclaimed from somewhere else, usually by shutting down or reducing power to one system to power up another.\nPlayed well, this can add extra tension and interest. Buffing up one aspect of something can expose a Logical Weakness in another aspect. An observant hero might use this to dodge the extra danger of one foe powering up an aspect of himself by exploiting the aspect he left vulnerable. Or a Wave Motion Gun might be enough to end a battle in one shot, but doing so requires that the user power down all other systems and leave himself vulnerable, thus justifying why he does not use it all the time.\nNote that most of the uses of this involve technology using presumably electrical charge or Minovsky Physics. However, this trope can also apply to something using steam pressure, Functional Magic, or other similar concepts, depending on how they are handled in the context of a particular setting.\n"}
{"NeedleworkIsForOldPeople": "This trope is for when needlework (knitting, sewing, crochet, darning, etc) is associated with the elderly in fiction. When Textile Work Is Feminine and this trope love each other very much, you get the idea that needlework is for \"grannies\" or \"old ladies\", so it's slightly more common among elderly women than men, but elders of both sexes are seen doing needlework and with this trope, younger women think it's for old people too.\nA younger Fashion Designer will often get away with sewing, but knitting, crochet, etc is still associated with the elderly. Often the old person who does needlework is either seen as a popular-with-kids Cool Old Lady or Cool Old Guy or a well-meaning but boring/embarrassing older family member. Both types will generally make clothes for their younger family members, which will either be liked or be seen as too ugly/itchy/boring, and the Homemade Sweater from Hell is often knitted by an elderly relative (often a grandma, grandpa, or great-aunt).\nOld people who do needlework are usually friendly no matter how they fall on the popularity spectrum, though some evil elders (like an elderly Wicked Witch for instance) may do needlework to exploit the stereotype of the friendly old lady/man.\nThis trope is Older Than Radio because many Fairy Tale's and Nursery Rhyme's mention \"the little old woman sitting at her spinning wheel\" or similar.\nSometimes Played for Laughs by having someone magically turn elderly and be seen instantly doing needlework or showing someone doing needlework who's elderly but also not human, for instance a Nearly Normal Animal, Civilized Animal, Funny Animal, mythical creature or alien.\nCommon for a Granny Classic. Contrast Knitting Pregnancy Announcement because with that trope, the woman is young enough to be fertile. Truth in Television for some, but not others.\n"}
{"RivalDojos": "A pair of rival schools of martial arts, run by a pair of masters who have probably been feuding for years before the series even started. If dojo is applied to non-Japanese martial arts, its use is an example of the Far East trope.\nMost often, but not always, the two masters were students of the same martial arts style before branching off to different styles: the protagonist usually (but not always) learning under the benevolent master who teaches wisdom and self defense, while the rival school is run by an Evil Mentor who encourages its students to be ruthless, aggressive and brutal. A tough Sensei for Scoundrels who takes the pragmatic middle-of-the-road approach could substitute for either of them.\nA subset of this trope comes in the form of members of one school (or even an unaffiliated challenger looking to show his prowess) going to the other dojo and challenging the sensei or top student to a match, usually as an excuse to then completely ransack the dojo, maim everyone inside, and steal a memento of their victory (typically the dojo's marquee). This kind of act, whose exact term is dojoyaburi (\u9053\u5834\u7834\u308a, \"dojo storming\"), is Truth in Television, and there are stories about brutal dojo wars in historic Japan and more recently in the Brazilian vale tudo scene.\nVery often comes up in Fighting Series. This situation often involves or ends with the main students from both schools eventually becoming friends or at least allies (usually after one of them defeats the other), effectively ending the feud, or turning it into a friendly rivalry (if it wasn't already) instead.\nSee also Feuding Families and Fire-Forged Friends.\n"}
{"SpaceCompression": "Sometimes a game's environment is blatantly not to scale. The usual culprits are fantasy RPGs and Wide Open Sandbox games. This freakish distortion of space is becoming more common these days, as the fashion is for photorealistic detail difficult to execute uniformly in a huge world and the banishment of abstractions such as world maps.\nNote, of course, that even in games with a City Map/world map separation, the scale will still be substantially reduced relative, at least, to the real world. Remember that it was the ninteenth century before 80 days became a plausible amount of time in which to circumnavigate the globe; walking from one side of the world map to the other would take years in a realistic scale. Heck, walking from one major city to another would take days if not weeks.\nCommon traits:\nAn Acceptable Break from Reality for several reasons:\nSee also Units Not to Scale, Clown Car Base and Thriving Ghost Town.\n"}
{"WhiteMage": "A White Mage is a character archetype and often a gameplay archetype which focuses on healing and/or buffing magic. They may also have access to magic that causes some status effects. Modern incarnations will often be given some offensive ability, often magic of the holy variety, though the Elemental Powers of water or wind may be given a healing affinity.\nFrequently, White Mages will be extremely effective against undead, either through the power of the Holy Hand Grenade, Turn Undead spells, or Revive Kills Zombie characteristics.\nMany games with a Character Class System or Job System, especially Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games, will have a White Mage class that fulfils the Healer role.\nA White Mage is almost always The Medic, although they have the addition of buffs. Female White Mages in Eastern RPGs are frequently the White Magician Girl, although they must also fit the personality requirements for that trope.\nWhite Mages are frequently paired with a Black Mage as a Foil. They also frequently overlap with Squishy Wizard, though they tend to be more resilient than their chromatic counterparts.\nSubtrope of Support Party Member. If a character has both healing and offensive magic in relatively equal measure, they are a Red Mage, instead. If a White Mage can sling healing spells while fighting on the front lines, you've got yourself what's known as a Paladin, or Combat Medic. Contrast Black Mage (the offense-oriented counterpart). Not to be confused with White Magic, which is only sometimes the source of a White Mage's power.\n"}
{"SurprisinglyGentleSong": "So, you have a band. They have a tendency to need to be Careful with That Axe. Their songs tend to be loud, aggressive, hardcore. Whether they lean toward Three Chords and the Truth or Epic Rocking, they are The New Rock & Roll. Moral Guardians hate them. They go crazy with the guitars, they go wild on the drums, the music is always played at top volume...\nWait, what? A slow, quiet, gentle piece? Beautiful and soft, it may be heartwarming or heartbreaking, but the defining characteristic is that it is far less aggressive a piece than you would ever expect from this band. May be a Black Sheep Hit, but differs from that trope in that it's not necessarily a hit, and only applies to normally aggressive bands. Many Power Ballads also prove to be examples of this trope. Compare Playing Against Type, Rated G for Gangsta (for rap musicians specifically) and Scary Musician, Harmless Music.\n"}
{"HenshinHero": "The Henshin Hero is a variation or subtrope of the Super Hero in which super-powered characters only have their special powers some of the time. A Henshin Hero has distinct normal and powered \"forms,\" and needs to actively switch between the two. In essence, the character's powers are all turned off while he or she is in their Secret Identity.\nHenshin Heroes often have a special item which they use to change into their heroic form. These items are usually activated by a command phrase, triggering a Transformation Sequence.\nThe transformation is frequently accompanied by a costume change. This gives the trope some overlap with Clothes Make the Superman: many male Henshin Heroes wear power-armor of some kind, and their transformation allows them to don their armor almost instantly. Bonus points if the change of clothing is the only outward difference, but nobody notices.\nThe name comes from the Japanese term for the trope, henshin (literally meaning \"change body\" but more practically translated as \"transformation\" or \"metamorphosis\" ... and not to be confused with the Shapeshifting or Metamorphosis tropes).\nSuperpowered Alter Ego is when this trope meets Split Personality. Magical Girls and Magical Girl Warriors are a subset of the Henshin Hero that are (usually) targeted toward the Shoujo demographic.\n"}
{"ClassTraitor": "Bob belongs to a certain group, or at least Alice considers him to belong to it. And thus she demands that he stay \"loyal\" to this group. It's beside the point whether or not the group actually exists as a relevant group and whether Bob actually sympathizes with it or not.\nAnd thus, Alice will consider Bob a \"traitor\" or similar whenever he does something she considers to be against the group. This also includes anything that might be beneficial to any other group, based on the assumption that helping others is the same as damaging the group. She gets to decide what's good for the category, and she assumes any disagreement comes from treachery. Note that words such as \"traitor\" or \"betrayer\" do not necessarily have to be invoked, as long as Alice makes her position clear one way or another.\nThis group can be exactly anything. In real life, psychological experiments have shown that people can quickly be made to develop group identity over any dividing lines, no matter how arbitrary and superficial. However, some dividers are more common than others. The classics are race, gender, class, religion, and what sports team you're cheering for. \"Uncle Tom\" is a common mainstream term for people who are perceived as betraying their own group in order to gain the favor of an outside, usually more powerful, group.\nBranding someone a Category Traitor is usually Serious Business... at least for the character who does it, even if the narrative doesn't agree \u2014 the accuser can be portrayed as justified or at least as a good kind of bigot, but can also be portrayed as a Strawman Political or someone doing Activist Fundamentalist Antics. In either case, being branded as a Category Traitor might cause Internalized Categorism. In cases where the accusation itself is an obvious strawman, this trope can be called Straw Traitor. A Cultural Rebel is especially prone to being branded as a Category Traitor. Can bring up accusations of being a Hypocrite (Straw or otherwise) on Alice's part, especially if Alice's category normally stresses the importance of things such as freedom and individuality (the obvious implication being that Alice hypocritically only pays lip service to these values). If Alice is prejudiced enough, she may label Bob a traitor even if she hates the things that non-traitorous members of the group supposedly do \u2014 because how can you justify hating someone if he doesn't have the good taste to conform to a hate-worthy stereotype?\nUsually overlaps with With Us or Against Us, when Alice gives Bob an ultimatum regarding whatever activities he may be doing that Alice considers traitorous. Often includes the use of an Outside/Inside Slur. Compare Boomerang Bigot and The Whitest Black Guy.\nThis is not an Audience Reaction entry: only examples where one character is in-universe accused of betraying his category are allowed. Whether or not the accusation is portrayed as justified is worth mentioning, but not relevant to whether or not it counts as an example.\n"}
{"SupernaturalElite": "The ruling class are monstrous/supernatural. The literal Blue Bloods, if you will.\nThis is nominally about supernatural creatures who have their own upper class (who are very likely to be more powerful than the lower-class supernaturals), but it can include characters who happen to be both supernatural and upper-class, characters who are supernatural because they're upper-class, or characters who are upper-class because they're supernatural. Due to the proud tradition of Asskicking Equals Authority and Authority Equals Asskicking, all four possibilities are likely to be true. Their lower-class subjects can be supernatural, \"normal\", or a mix of the two.\nCan overlap with God-Emperor, if the claim of the monarch's godhood is genuine; and Hive Queen, if her control over the Hive Mind is supernatural in nature (e.g. via a Psychic Link).\nIn some ways, the martial skills of feudal aristocracies (who were often the only skilled fighters at the time) could be compared to the supernatural skills of these elites. There's probably some element of Social Darwinism at work here.\nSome ancient cultures believed this to be Truth in Television (or at least the subjects were supposed to believe that), e.g. concerning the Pharaoh of Egypt.\nSubtropes include:\nVampires Are Rich is a Sister Trope (if not a subtrope). See also Super Supremacist, who believes their supernatural powers give them the right to rule over Muggles.\n"}
{"FiveAcesCheater": "Cheating in games is almost as old as games themselves, but if you get caught, you will be instantly kicked out of the competition.\nThis trope however, is when a character is cheating in an obvious and blatant manner and all the other players and the audience can clearly see that. He may do something seemingly impossible that could be only be done with special equipment or supernatural powers that aren't allowed, or something that the game itself makes impossible. The best example is the name of this trope, named after the very common gag in media of a character playing Poker and having a hand of five aces, when a card deck has only fournote\u00a0This can be possible in card games that are played with multiple decks at once, or something similar like having a hand of six cards, when in Poker you can only get five.\nIn extreme cases, all the competitors are doing something impossible or that they can't do all at once, such as a card game in which every player has four aces, meaning all of them are cheating.note\u00a0Bar the one player that might have legitimately gotten four aces; but what are the odds of that....\nThis is pretty much a Paper-Thin Disguise version of cheating and it's almost always Played for Comedy. The more comedic version is when no one notices the obvious cheating and they maybe even think the character is just that good, or someone actually notices but does nothing about it. The less comedic version is when audience and other competitors notice it and complain, but the cheater still gets away, or doesn't. The Played for Drama version is when it's revealed or stated since the beginning that the whole game is rigged, and/or the cheater is such a powerful or dangerous person that nobody will risk standing up to him.\nWhen adding examples involving supernatural powers, avoid cases where use of powers is allowed through Loophole Abuse or because all the characters regard \"creative\" use of superpowers as part of the fun.\nVideo Games\nComic Books\nFilm - Animated\nFilm - Live Action\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nVideo Games\nWeb Original\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"LostTribe": "The Lost Tribe is an (indigenous) ethnic group that lives in (almost) complete isolation from the outside world, oblivious to the existence of modern civilization, technology, and other concepts. However, their way of life may be changed after being contacted by foreign people from the outside world.\nAlso related to Hollywood Natives, Noble Savage, The Savage Indian, Last of His Kind, and Schizo Tech.\n"}
{"SpyVersusSpy": "If you are looking for the comic strip, see Spy vs. Spy\nPerhaps inspired by the use of SPECTRE as the villain in the James Bond movies rather than the communist villains of the books, a popular trope in spy films is to have two opposing organizations of agents who have a tenuous connection to a government if any. Typically, this is played for humor, and oddly, while some of the evil organizations are supposed to have quite horrible ideologies, their membership is generally depicted as being of a Punch-Clock Villain nature.\n"}
{"ShoehornedFirstLetter": "Sometimes a character will need to come up with a word that starts with a certain letter, but wants or needs to say one that doesn't qualify. The solution: stick the necessary letter in front of the desired word and call it a day! Often done to make a word fit into an acronym or Alliterative List.\nCompare Xtreme Kool Letterz, Recursive Acronym.\n"}
{"TheImp": "The Imp is tons of vices rolled into one, with the baggage that something about him totally destroys him as a threat: sheer laziness, apathy or just being very tiny. The Imp looks like he's trying too hard, intentionally or because of the designers. So whether or not they have delusions of grandeur, Imps just end up behaving very practically, wanting mostly to have fun and to wallow in their vices.\nWhile commonly in a sidekick role to a stronger character, you often see the Imp with heroic characters as much as with villainous ones. Aside from heroes being less likely to beat on them, the Imp can function as the hero's \"Bad Angel\". But in this case, it mainly ends up showing off how decent and good-hearted the hero is, because he doesn't take the Imp's advice seriously.\nThey are the Weasel Mascot, Chaotic Neutral version. They can occasionally cause a great deal of havoc on their own, making them a Not-So-Harmless Villain, but usually whatever holds them back stops them from doing too much damage in the end. Frequently overlaps with the Snarky Nonhuman Sidekick. They are sometimes prone to Dark Is Not Evil. Contrast The Jester.\n"}
{"IndianSummer": "In any setting where exists a standard four season climate, there will always be an episode or chapter where it is unseasonably warm and beautiful. This will always occur at the beginning or end of summer (depending on whether summers in the area are known for being oppressively hot and humid, or blessed and carefree, respectively.)\nIndian summer weather is always important to the plot, as it signifies the beginning of the last chapter in the characters' relationship \u2014 a romance, a road trip, etc. The characters are able to enjoy some carefree time together right before things start to go south.\nIf it is a Coming-of-Age Story, the last time the characters get together to have fun before going their separate ways will always be an unseasonably warm and pleasant day. Some huge relationship battle will invariably occur and separate the tight-knit group of characters by nightfall, only to have them reunite (possibly years later) in more depressing circumstances, usually in the rain.\nCompare Bittersweet Ending. Inverse of It's Always Spring. Closely related to First Snow.\nContrast Dreaming of a White Christmas, Heat Wave.\nNot to be confused with the weather in India, although the trope fully applies to works set in South Asia on unseasonably cool days, or with a certain anime of the same name (alternately known as Koharu Biyori).\n"}
{"NeverTrustaTrailer": "If Covers Always Lie, trailers can, too. Sometimes Tonight, Someone Dies or hyping The Reveal might not be enough. And with the Internet an open window these days for writers and directors to viewers' likes, dislikes, hopes, predictions, and Shipping loyalties, it's easy to know exactly how to bait fans into watching the next episode. Be careful not to believe everything you see, though, because as all Fan Vid makers know, any scene can be mixed-and-matched with another to look completely different from their real context.\nOf course, Tropes Are Tools, as used correctly this can be a very clever way of averting Trailers Always Spoil (by not mentioning or downplaying the real main plot).\nIndeed, the creation of fake trailers to make a movie look like it's from a completely different genre has become one of the Internet's most beloved recent art forms, such as The Shining as a family-oriented romantic comedy, Mary Poppins as a slasher horror flick, Luke Cage (2016) as a 90's sitcom, or the one that started it all, The Ten Commandments as a high school romantic comedy.\nAnother way it can backfire is if you can't find enough good footage to make a decent trailer, audiences can extrapolate just how bad the rest of the material must be.\nIf it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.\nSee this list for more examples.\nSubtropes:\nOften a form of Misaimed Marketing (it's been said that trailers reflect the movie the studio wanted to make, rather than the one that actually got made). If it's a TV show's Title Sequence that lies, those are Bait-and-Switch Credits.\n"}
{"NeverMeetYourHeroes": "There are people we admire, even idolize; people who are everything we want to be. Even if we meet them only briefly, they have the power to change our lives. These mentors and idols teach us to use our full potential and do great things, and not only do we love them for it, we imagine nothing could ever tarnish the memory we hold of them...\n...unless this trope is in play.\nIf you're in fiction and you look up to someone, chances are good that they're the scum of the earth. At least, they\u2019re not what you think they are \u2014 or they were, but time has passed and the luster has faded. (This is particularly likely if the audience has just heard about them for the first time). If you're in law enforcement, you'll probably suffer the double blow of seeing their darkest secrets and being the one to put them in handcuffs. If your idol was your teacher, you'll find yourself repeating \u2014 with bitter irony \u2014 some maxim or mantra that you still hold but your mentor has since abandoned.\nWhat makes a pedestal break varies, but it runs anywhere from a good person who abandoned their ideals or switched sides to a monster who was Evil All Along. Most of the time, the idol kept his shining image by hiding or suppressing anything damning, but sometimes the fault was in those who worshiped him and saw an overly idealized image instead of the real person. Expect them to ask, \"Was It All a Lie?\"\nThis trope disallows real life examples, and with good reason. If you have ever had someone turn on you at least once or realize the person you looked up to and considered a friend is the opposite of what you expected, you'd concur that this trope is Truth in Television. In fact, you'll be surprised that it's more if not just as common in Real Life as it is in fiction. Should real life examples be allowed, there would be a risk of this page crashing because there's just that too much to list.\nIt doesn't always have to involve celebrities, either. It can also be the last person you'd expect (or want), like your Childhood Friends or your older brother (or sister), even your own parents if you're unlucky enough.\nWhen the mentor or idol is both worthy of admiration but flawed enough to make them unlikeable, that's Warts and All.\nRelated to Beleaguered Childhood Friend, False Friend and Big Bad Friend. Compare Fallen Hero and Historical Hero Upgrade. Also compare Defiled Forever and My Girl Is Not a Slut. Contrast with Evil Mentor, who was Obviously Evil from the beginning. Not to be confused with Broken Base. Also contrast Rebuilt Pedestal, when a formerly Broken Pedestal is forgiven or exonerated. Contrast with Blind Obedience, where this usually isn't the case.\nDue to the nature of the trope, there will be unmarked spoilers abound. You have been warned.\n"}
{"WeakSauceWeakness": "Being a Super Hero ain't easy. Most of the original Flying Bricks have the good Achilles heels covered, and the pharmacy is even out of Psycho Serum to give you a cheap Backstory gimmick to explain your powers.\nWhat's left for the modern hero and villain to do? Make do with a Weaksauce Weakness. It's great for comedic effect, but just as often it ends up being an Achilles' Heel that makes your average Mundane Solution seem perfectly reasonable by comparison.\nThe weakness isn't a common household cleaning agent like Mundane Solution, but something so incredibly, stupidly embarrassing you'd think the Super Hero would never use his power out of shame in the off chance someone found out about it, or because it shows up regularly in the course of their super heroing. The \"weakness\" might come in the form of the fuel for the super power, a humiliating Transformation Sequence or activation phrase, an Embarrassing but Empowering Outfit, or just a set of restrictions on the powers that really are begging to get laughed at. Therefore, this is one of the most popular ways to Bless your hero With Suck.\nIf the weakness is a Logical Weakness, it can be pulled off. If not, it can seriously stress the Willing Suspension of Disbelief, unless it's Played for Laughs.\nEspecially cruel writers will have clever villains make it a Weaponized Weakness. However, a Kryptonite-Proof Suit can even the odds.\nThis is also commonly exploited in an Easily Thwarted Alien Invasion, where Bizarre Alien Biology is probably to blame.\nSubtropes include:\nRelated to Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?. See also Kryptonite Factor, which is a weaksauce weakness for superheroes. If played for laughs, the one so harmed may Fight Off the Kryptonite. In extreme cases, the character will defend themselves from the weakness with a Cross-Melting Aura. For the inversion, of being at risk from a lack of something, see Phlebotinum Dependence.\n"}
{"TranslationStyleChoices": "Translation is something of a difficult process. When translating from one language to another (Japanese to English or vice versa being an example many readers will be familiar with) there are a number of cultural quirks and little rules for you to consider. (See Gratuitous Japanese for more on this.)\nSo, there are basically five ways translators go about their work (and three in which they hopefully don't):\nIt shouldn't be too hard to guess what method this is; essentially, it's an extremely loose adaptation, or translation by Broad Strokes. This can be fairly advantageous for the viewer who is otherwise unfamiliar with the source material (hey, no cultural changes for you to appreciate/go \"what the blank\" over!), but hardcore fans of the original will feel violated to say the least (and if done without the consent or knowledge of the original producers, they can feel rather violated as well).\nSomewhere between Cut-and-Paste Translation and Woolseyism. With Streamlined dubs, the plot is usually kept intact, although almost all dialogue is thrown out the window and replaced. Sometimes, this works quite well. Streamline Pictures, the Trope Namer, and Manga UK were very famous for this style of dubbing.\nNamed on TVTropes after Ted Woolsey, who was known for his more pragmatic translations of games. This approach is formally referred to as dynamic equivalence; the general idea is that the translation should give the foreign audience the same experience as the original, even if some details have to be altered and some aspects that would cause controversy or fail to translate sensibly just have to be left out. The general guideline when using this method is that the work needs to be self-contained; if the script contains references or connotations that wouldn't be obvious to the target audience, those elements should probably be left out or changed. It's probably the best tool for a localization: the purists get their original storyline intact (more or less), but you don't need an introductory lesson in a foreign language and culture to understand what's going on. Of course, the hardcore purists will still hate it.\nSome productions, however, decide they're going the direct route. The story is getting straight-up translated, Values Dissonance be damned, and no pesky honorific changes, dialect jokes, or cultural variations are going to get in the way. This is the most literal of the methods, typically translating only dialogue and leaving anything that doesn't directly translate fully intact. The downside to this is that a lot of the necessary elements for full understanding don't make the journey overseas with the dialogue; as a result, J. Random Viewer (lacking proper context) is left scratching his head, as some lines will sound strange or seem to come out of nowhere. In the worst cases, some figures of speech may be translated literally, instead of going with an equivalent from the vernacular language or simply translating the meaning.\nThe same as category 3, but also includes explanations in the form of footnotes, liner notes, or captions to explain the details. Widely used by fansubbers of anime. Explaining a joke may make it not be very funny, but some cultural references work a lot better this way:\nGrammar rules will be violated and homonyms may have the wrong meaning translated. Fortunately, the vast, vast majority of serious commercial releases rarely fall into this category, but there are a depressing number of 1980s video games that were translated in this manner. And let's not even get started on bootlegs...\nThe exclusive domain of Hong Kong bootleggers. Want to translate something but don't know any English? Translate it into your language and Babelfish it into English! Better yet, if you don't even know the language you're translating it from, you can Babelfish it into your language and then Babelfish that translation into English! Now you too can translate anything from any language into any other language without understanding either!\n"}
{"JerkAssGods": "Perhaps they view all of life as a cosmic game, with humans as mere pawns and tools. Perhaps they're hungry for worship, either out of necessity or just out of a huge ego, and are willing to resort to manipulation and worse to get it. Maybe they're just keen on Disproportionate Retribution (a very common trait in religions throughout history). Maybe it's the age-old adage \"power corrupts\", or maybe they're just trolls, but whatever the case, the gods are just jerks. They view human life as a source of entertainment or an inconvenience.\nThis trope is Older Than Dirt. The Ur-Example might be Inanna, Sumerian goddess of getting laid and ultraviolence. As might be expected from someone of that description, she took exception to being spurned by the hero Gilgamesh and summoned a heavenly bull to go on a rampage through his city, and if her father denied her that bull, she would have caused a Zombie Apocalypse. It did not help that as he turned her down, he listed all her exes and how she arranged their terrible deaths.\nCompare and contrast Abusive Precursors, and for cases where Jerkass doesn't really cover it, God of Evil, and God Is Evil; or, for a milder version, consider God Is Flawed. Often worshiped by the Corrupt Church and/or the Religion of Evil. Related to God and Satan Are Both Jerks as well as World of Jerkass. Anyone playing Religious Russian Roulette with a Jerkass God probably won't like how it ends. In video games, where you are the god, see Cruel Player-Character God.

Oh, he'd let you take him home, just don't expect him (or any of your valuable possessions) to be there next morning. In Real Life, a child who lives on the streets experiences horrors most of us could not even imagine, but in some fictional works, a child on the street lives a happy-go-lucky life and practically thrives (probably no longer terrified by such horrors).\nHe is exceptionally Street Smart, and can take care of himself better than most adults, being a bit more experienced in the field. He is usually a criminal. Not the poor, innocent child who hates having to steal out of desperation, but the whip-smart trickster. The adult protagonist may feel sorry for him and try to help him at first, but it will usually turn out that the adult actually needs his help. He often has some sort of unique knowledge or skill that the protagonist needs in some circumstance, such as how to access any part of the city through the sewer system.\nHe'll probably start out as a pest, but he'll turn out to be one of the Hero's most powerful and stalwart allies when the chips are down. He's characterized by sarcasm, cynicism, skepticism, incredible resourcefulness, and a charming fascination with violence, but in the end he's likely to succumb to the temptation of family life with the Hero and his Girl, even if his life on the street was clearly more Awesome. He's also fairly likely to die by Taking the Bullet for the Hero. In this case, the Hero will retroactively adopt the Kid, for instance by putting his own surname on the Kid's tombstone. Can grow up to become a Satisfied Street Rat, but the Dodger is more of a trickster where archetypally the Street Rat is more of a cutthroat.\nIf the Artful Dodger is working for someone (as the original did), expect his boss to be some variety of The Fagin.\nUsually male, but there are a few exceptions.\nCompare with Lovable Rogue or Baker Street Regular.\n"}
{"ShoottheMedicFirst": "In Real Life war, medics are supposed to be special: The Laws and Customs of War, specifically the Geneva Convention, dictate that medical personnel are non-combatants and shooting one is a serious war crime. So is impersonating one so that the enemy won't shoot you. And it's just as illegal for a medic to shoot at you \u2014 while they have weapons to defend themselves with, the moment they initiate combat, they are classed as combatants and can be freely shot at in response.\nFor tactical reasons, there's no real point in shooting at medics either (well, except psychological reasons); in combat, a downed soldier usually remains down for the current battle (with medical treatment and recovery occurring slowly over the days, weeks, and even months that follow \u2014 and there's no guarantee that a wounded soldier will even be able to return to combat after recovery is over), and medics are also trained to treat the enemy as well as their own comrades if at all possible, provided that they aren't presenting a threat. And they can only assist one soldier at a time anyway. In fact, you usually want to leave medics well alone since retrieving a fallen comrade usually requires the help of an additional person, so this puts at least one other potential enemy out of action, making the fight easier \u2014 to say nothing of the fact that, even after they're rescued, wounded soldiers laid up in hospitals drain resources and money, making it useful on a strategic level, too.note\u00a0Of course, The Medic, and the feeling that the medic will be there to save you if something happens, is a big plus to morale. But morale isn't what's shooting at you right now.\nBut if you're in a Video Game, you can forget all about that, because video game medics are magical.\nUnlike Real Life, a video game medic will magically heal critically wounded soldiers back to full combat effectiveness in a matter of seconds \u2014 and in many cases, reviving soldiers Back from the Dead isn't too much more difficult. This makes an enemy healer a primary target, because when left alone, they will ultimately start reviving and healing your enemies almost as fast as you can take them out; enemies accompanied by healers effectively become Nigh Invulnerable so long as the healer is present, so if you want to have any hope of winning, you must Shoot the Medic First.\nJust be prepared for an occasional Roaring Rampage of Revenge from the medic's True Companions, or that the boss may spontaneously Turn Red when he learns his healer has been taken out.\nDraw Aggro is a useful way to defy this, as long as it's not the medic drawing the enemy attention.\nWhen medics won't put up with getting attacked first and actually start fighting back, they become a Combat Medic. Straight for the Commander is the same idea, but applied to the commander instead of medics. See also Shoot the Mage First.\n"}
{"PlanetofHats": "On their Wagon Train to the Stars, our intrepid heroes come across a planet whose inhabitants all share a single defining characteristic. Everybody is a robot, or a gangster, or a Proud Warrior Race Guy, or an over-the-top actor, or wearing a Nice Hat. To some degree, this is unavoidable; you only have so much screen time or page space to develop and explore a culture. This is especially true in episodic series where the heroes travel to a new planet each week and you have to both introduce a planet and tell a story all within a single episode. If planets are revisited, it also provides an easy way for viewers to keep track of which planet is which and remember where the story is set.\nEarth itself is sometimes portrayed as a Planet of Hats. note\u00a0And anthropologists have discovered many universal human traits that could plausibly fit the bill.The defining human characteristic is often \"pluck\", \"sheer cussedness\", creativity, and sometimes even \"diversity\", though \"evil\" and \"stupidity\" are common in more misanthropic works. Sometimes it's stated that Hattery is the natural state and it's humans that are the aberrant ones, or rather that humanity's Hat is not having one.\nWriters love to use the hat planet to represent controversial issues in society whenever they can. This way the show's characters can take a thinly disguised public stand on an issue that the network execs would otherwise consider too taboo to openly discuss. We can't have our heroes discussing euthanasia, but should they stumble across a Planet of Hats where everyone who gets sick is put to death, then it's okay. Eventually the plots will run out with an entire race of identical people so one or more of the species will have their hat fall off, declaring My Species Doth Protest Too Much. Alternately, the show may explore why Klingon Scientists Get No Respect. For maximum typing, the characters can also be physically uniform, as in People of Hair Color.\nThe Planet of Hats may also be an unintended result of a Character Exaggeration type Plot Tumor applied to an entire race, when the audience had previously only seen a single representative who the writers now wish to market. For cases where a planetary hat is extrapolated retroactively from a single character, see Planet of Copyhats.\nJust for comparison, Earth has seven continents, hosting just under two hundred sovereign states, with an estimated five thousand ethnicities and 7,000 living languages. There is no reason to suspect that alien life forms would be any different, but in media they are nowhere near as diverse as one might expect.\nOccasionally justified in settings with relatively convenient space travel and colonization. Consider that anatomically modern homo sapiens had scattered across the continents long before what we call \"civilization\" developed independently in different parts of the world, and that the absence of fast transportation or communication caused populations to exchange little information with each other until they had already developed persistent cultural differences. If a group of space colonists from the same culture settled an uninhabited planet and were left to develop on their own, they could hypothetically spread that culture over the entire planet and attempt to preserve cultural unity through mass communication. That said, it would be unlikely for that culture to stay monolithic forever, as various subcultures, countercultures, and new movements would naturally start to pop up over time.\nCompare: Gang of Hats. Contrast: Multicultural Alien Planet. See also Rubber-Forehead Aliens, Intelligent Gerbil, Scary Dogmatic Aliens, Tribe of Priests. May result because Apathy Killed the Cat. If the planet's hat is being evil, it's an example of Always Chaotic Evil. Serious Business is what happens when the show's setting gets a hat. This trope in itself is a good example of Sci-Fi Writers Have No Sense of Scale. See Single-Biome Planet when the planet is unnaturally uniform physically. One-Product Planet is a subtrope, but focuses on economics rather than culture.\nHas nothing to do with a certain war-themed hat simulator, Or the show Lidsville which was a literal planet of hats. For the webcomic of the same name, see here.\n"}
{"ToBeAMaster": "To Be a Master is the Series Goal behind about 70% of all shonen manga and anime. Sure, Mecha Show, Harem Show, Sentai and the odd detective story are all okay, but if you really want to strike a winning story formula for audiences, To Be a Master is the winning way to go. In fact, this is so prevalent that sometimes the demographic term \"shonen\" is used to refer to this genre, due in part to the success of Naruto and Pok\u00e9mon.\nThe setup is deceptively simple: In a World... where everything else revolves around one thing \u2014 Card Games, pirates, ninjas, anything \u2014 a young lad (or lass in some cases) in his/her teens (or younger), usually an Ideal Hero, will set out on a quest to, well, To Be a Master of whatever their world deems important, be it Monsters, Card Games, guardians, sweets, or even fashion...\nThe Myth Arc will invariably involve The Chosen One meeting one or more True Companions along their way and snobby Rivals, defeating goofy Villains and Worthy Opponents, and having a go at 'getting' the girl (or boy).\nThe only catch? They'll be lucky if they achieve this goal in the next fifteen years (although there are also cases where attaining mastery isn't that far off). To Be a Master is such a successful format that these weekly TV series sometimes tend to drag on for years (especially if it's really, really popular) in an effort to exploit as much as possible out of the show. We're all suckers for starry-eyed youths who fight to accomplish their dreams, so expect Loads and Loads of Characters and a strict Sorting Algorithm of Evil to keep feeding new 'challenges' to our hero week after week (year after year). Throw in the inevitable Tournament Arc and levelling powerups and we're ready to go!\nApart from sports manga, where the ultimate goal is to win some sort of trophy, the usual reward in 'To Be a Master' consists of a title, something along the lines of \"The World-Theme King\" or \"The World-Theme Master,\" that is acknowledged by literally everyone in that world- and brings a set of privileges with it, hopefully the power to make your dreams come true. If there is a title, important plot points will be who held the title before and the fact that it can only be gained under special circumstances, such as being a designated candidate to take part in a worldwide tournament. Otherwise, the main character will likely just want to make their dreams come true, even if there isn't any kind of title.\nDepending on the series' setting, the hero's opponents may not necessarily be evil, and are simply after the same prize that The Protagonist is... They may become a Designated Antagonist when they oppose the hero, but nothing prevents them from becoming friends and allies if he beats them, or they beat him/her. Prominent rivals may even get A Day in the Limelight episodes that develop them 'beyond' simply the hero's latest opponent and may even get a Belated Back Story.\nThe story may not even ''end'' when the hero becomes a Master. Becoming the best is one thing, staying the best in this world is another. Masters can face any number of challengers out to take their title for themselves, or even just up-and-comers who want to test their skills or build a reputation by taking them on.\nNamed after a Pok\u00e9mon song used in the Pikachu's Jukebox segments of the dubbed versions of the Pok\u00e9mon anime, called \"2.B.A. Master\". Also the name of the album that the English theme song itself was released on.\nSee also Gaming and Sports Anime and Manga, which often overlaps with this.\n"}
{"InstantMysteryJustDeleteScene": "Alice gets home after a long day. Just as she makes herself comfortable, the doorbell rings. Suddenly the scene jumps to Bob and Claire, who are talking about how they haven't seen Alice this morning. Suddenly the audience realizes that it's the next morning, and we never found out who was at the door. Will Bob and Claire now have to investigate Alice's murder? Or is it all a Red Herring?\nOften part of a Cold Opening or used as a way of setting up a case of Not Quite Dead.\nThis has become almost a staple of murder mysteries, especially in Live-Action TV shows like Diagnosis: Murder and Monk.\n"}
{"Buttmonkey": "The character who is always the butt of the demeaning joke or the \"put them through hell\" plotline. For whatever reason, the Butt Monkey seems to walk through life with a permanent \"Kick Me\" sign attached to their backs, invisible to them, but all too visible to the rest of the world. Nothing ever goes right for this character, and if something bad is going to happen to someone, chances are it's going to happen to them. Long story short, it sucks to be the Butt Monkey.\nSimply having a character go through hell once or twice (no matter how severely) is not enough to be the Butt Monkey. With primary and secondary characters, it must be a regular occurrence. With tertiary characters, it must be their sole purpose to exist. It's not necessarily Karma. They don't have to deserve what they go through, but they're an easy target. Sometimes it's all the writers can think of to do with the character.\nThe direct opposite of a Karma Houdini (although technically the definition applies to those who escape from karma regardless of whether it's good or bad). If carried too far, may result in Deus Angst Machina. This can be counteracted if you occasionally Throw the Dog a Bone, though many writers just can't resist Yanking The Dog's Chain. The Butt Monkey is occasionally dangerous if they're pushed too far.\nIf the audience sympathizes with them, they become a Woobie. Furthermore, if the audience begins to resent the \"unfair\" treatment of the character, they can become the Designated Monkey. The joke can also be dragged too far in other ways\u2014to make a character a Butt Monkey of fate is one thing; to have them constantly taking the punishment for the misdeeds of an unsympathetic cast is another. However, if the audience relishes the character's misfortune and looks forward to seeing them suffer, congratulations; your Butt Monkey has devolved into The Chew Toy.\nWhile the trope is often played for laughs and we are encouraged to find the misery at least somewhat amusing, some portrayals go for a much darker presentation, deconstructing the idea and showing what an emotional and psychological wreck such a person would be like in real life.\nAlmost Always Male. In cases that the Butt Monkey is female, is regularly used for slapstick and it is Played for Laughs, she is probably also a case of Slapstick Knows No Gender. If every conceivable misfortune happens to the Butt Monkey, regardless of its logic or lack thereof, you've got yourself a Cosmic Plaything.\nIf someone is Giving the Sword to a Noob, nine times out of ten this person is the noob. When a plan needs to be executed and others won't touch it, chances are they'll get the dirty job. If a plan requires someone to be The Bait, if the other members of the team don't volunteer, they'll usually get volunteered to do it. On the other hand, if someone in the cast other than The Hero is going to Take a Level in Badass, it's almost invariably the Butt Monkey who does it. If the Butt Monkey is fat, they may or may not be a Fat Comic Relief, which often are Butt Monkeys.\nSee also: Bumbling Sidekick, The Un-Favourite, Guilt by Association Gag, Humiliation Conga, Iron Butt Monkey. Is nearly always on the receiving end of Comedic Sociopathy. When a character isn't a Butt Monkey in the work itself, but gets treated as one in Fanon, that's Memetic Loser.\nDo note that the Butt Monkey is often not meant to be hated by the audience. For characters completely intended to be dislikable, contrast Hate Sink.\nIn real life, everyone single one of us runs into bad luck now and then, so said examples are not possible.\n"}
{"SynchronousEpisodes": "In which two episodes of a series, usually (but not always) right next to each other in broadcast order, are shown by overlapping scenes to occur at the same time. At times has subtle differences based on which character is the focus in which episode, relating it to The Rashomon.\nCompare Arbitrarily Serialized Simultaneous Adventures, a Video Game-specific subtrope where the player can decide in which order to play through the synchronous levels.\nA more precise version of Simultaneous Arcs, as while that trope simply requires two stories to take place at the same time chronologically, this trope has said stories share the same scenes and/or related driving forces. Basically, a Simultaneous Arc story will have Alice and Bob doing something at the same time, but a Synchronous Episode story has things happen to either Alice or Bob based on the actions of the other (Alice is in a Babysitting Episode with Bob's baby cousin because Bob has an important job interview that day).\n"}
{"Reboot": "Reboot may refer to:\n"}
{"RecountedByTheMainCharacters": "Sometimes, \"this is a true story\" is part of the fiction.\nOnce in a while a really well written story can feel so real that you begin to wonder if it might not be based on a true story. Occasionally this is actually the case, or supposedly so, but there are times when an author (etc) will go right out of their way to create greater immersion in their work by claiming that their very obviously fictional and fantastic world is in some way real. Usually they claim that they didn't come up with the story, rather it was recounted to them by the actual main characters (or some other witness), often physically, but sometimes by phone or magic. Other times they will claim that they found the account in the form of a diary and novelised it, or, if it is a film, that it comprises found footage or a mixture of found footage and Dramatisation.\nAnother common method is to claim that the book was written as a testimony (or confession) to actual events - possibly the most notable example of this is The Guild of Specialists trilogy, which takes the love that boys' annuals have for intricate diagrams and maps to its absolute extreme and fabricates not only a plethora of large diagrams, maps, and sketches, but photos and objects. In this version the author pretends they are simply publishing something that someone else has written - this often takes the form of a novelization of a diary or a set of notebooks. Other methods include accounts by secondary characters and so on. This trope, a staple of children's books and fantastic tales, often features an Author Avatar or even instances of From Beyond the Fourth Wall or other strangeness and may be said to be translated from accounts of what happened or books written by the characters and never actually communicated in person.\nIn all these cases, however, it is considered canon that the author is repeating a story that is in fact true, if only to a certain degree. One of the people the story is about may even be the author themselves.\nCompare ...And That Little Girl Was Me, and Based on a Great Big Lie.\nAbsolutely not to be confused with Literary Agent Hypothesis, when fans think that maybe the story is actually real, or like to think it is, but don't have any support from canon or Word of God. Also not to be confused with A True Story in My Universe, for In-Universe examples. Often ties in with Author Avatar and may involve an admitted Unreliable Narrator.\nNote: This trope only applies to canon and Word of God examples in fictional works. In-Universe examples go in A True Story in My Universe. Pure Fanon examples go in Literary Agent Hypothesis.\n"}
{"SphereOfPower": "So, your Player Character just got an Invincibility Power-Up, your anime hero unlocked a Super Mode, or your essay is due in an hour and you drink a Red Bull. How do you represent the sudden increase in power? With circles and spheres.\nIt can be in the form of a debris cloud that envelops the character, a Chunky Updraft that circles the character like electrons around an atom, a full-body halo that radiates from him, a barrier of any stripe, a cyclone spiraling upwards, or maybe Instant Runes following the character around like a celestial spotlight. Point is, it's got circles and therefore it must be powerful.\nThis is possibly because a circle (in 2D) and sphere (in 3D) are the shapes any equally distributed outward pressure will form.\nNot to be confused with the Sphere of Destruction, although the two often do overlap, or the alternate magic system Sourcebook Spheres of Power, though you could build one with those rules. Compare Orbiting Particle Shield.\n"}
{"LyricalColdOpen": "Most songs start with an instrumental intro before heading into the first verse or chorus. Some even have a fade-in. A Lyrical Cold Open is the musical equivalent of a Cold Open, where the vocalist jumps in with lyrics at the very beginning, either before the music starts or at the same time it does, often adding an element of surprise or impact. Makes the song instantly recognizable to anyone who's heard it before, with the first line often becoming one of the most memorable parts.\nA Cappella songs don't count, nor does Studio Chatter, nor do songs that segue immediately from previous music in longer works. Contrast with Epic Instrumental Opener.\n"}
{"BrokenMessiah": "The first impression you get when you see these people is that they're really, really nice... maybe too nice. They're very humble, they care about everyone and almost never hold a grudge, they're always Taking the Bullet for their friends, and even if the audience doesn't always like them, they're almost invariably loved in-universe.\nThen, they discover something about themselves. Maybe they try to ignore their jealous feelings when they get caught in a Love Triangle. Maybe they wake up from a dream revealing their suppressed inner desires. Or maybe they just can't bring themselves to forgive someone who wronged their loved ones. Whatever the case, when they discover this about themselves, there's a good chance that they will enter a bout of depression, or worse, completely Freak Out. Oftentimes, their friends have a hard time understanding what the big deal is. Humans Are Flawed, after all, and because they're just so nice, they never held anyone else to the same moral standards.\nUnlike Heroic Self-Deprecation, these characters do not have to be The Hero, or even a hero. HSD involves a character's feelings of inadequacy, often when confronted with a seemingly insurmountable task or haunted by a previous failure. A character is a Broken Messiah, on the other hand, if their guilt stems from emotional issues.\nThat does not, however, mean that it can't be Played for Laughs. This trope can actually fall almost anywhere on the Sliding Scale of Silliness vs. Seriousness.\nContrast My God, What Have I Done?, in which the character's guilt is over something truly, indisputably wrong. Romantic examples may overlap with Love Hurts. The diametric opposite of But for Me, It Was Tuesday, where someone is so evil that they can commit truly heinous acts without any remorse.\nNot to be confused with Broken Saints.\n"}
{"FamouslyMundaneFictionallyMagical": "A sub-trope of Public Domain Artifact, this is the one where real-life objects of notable historical value (that indisputably exist or existed in real life) are given a magical makeover in a work of fiction. Think of it as the inanimate version of Beethoven Was an Alien Spy or a Historical Object Upgrade. Can be related to Clap Your Hands If You Believe, Weaponized Landmark or Real Event, Fictional Cause.\n"}
{"TheMccoy": "\"By God, Jim! You can't seriously be considering this! Screw the Prime Directive, there's no time for debate! We have to act now to rescue the High Priestess; forget the MacGuffin and think about doing what's right!\nWhat's that, Spock? 'Logic?' If we listened to your cold reasoning, you'd have us look for that stupid Cosmic Keystone while innocent people suffer! Especially since one of them could help us get it a whole lot faster!\"\nThe McCoy is another part of the Freudian Trio, along with The Kirk and The Spock. (Specifically, the Id.) Where the former is rational and intuitive, and the latter is cold and logical, the McCoy is emotional and humanistic. He cares about others deeply; for him doing the right thing is not a question of convenience or moral relativity, but about the concrete reality right now. Which is to say, someone like The Kirk cares about saving people; the McCoy cares about making things right. That is to say, when placed in front of the To Be Lawful or Good dilemma, the McCoy will always choose the \"Good\" option in a heartbeat. This often leads the heroes into hot water as this concern for others blinds him to complications in the Moral Dilemma of the week and leads him to advocate (or take it upon himself to do) \"the right thing\", regardless of how disastrous it would be in the short or long run.\nThat said, they help keep the drama of a situation personal both for the characters and the viewer, reminding us just why the Littlest Cancer Patient deserves for The Hero to use the Applied Phlebotinum that only works once on him rather than to get them home. To be fair, the Spock can be just as compassionate, but is tempered with detachment and enough forethought to realize that the right answer might not be the correct one, (illogical as that sounds). This makes them more willing to sacrifice a few people for many (or sacrifice themselves).\nThe McCoy is frequently a target for reminders about the Prime Directive; one or more episodes might focus on how having his heart on his sleeve can actually cause quite a bit of damage to the people he \"helps\" with the best of intentions.\nThe McCoy still functions as an admirable character, however, due to his absolute devotion to his moral beliefs and his refusal to give in to what others may tell him. To him, there is no such thing as acceptable losses (unless offset by a larger return fitting the loss). And if you start claiming that numbers can be lost or that A Million Is a Statistic, you can expect a thorough chewing out for your coldness. In the McCoy's mind, every life matters and everyone deserves to be saved. While The Spock sees people as numbers in the greater picture, The McCoy sees people with real lives and emotions. Not that he's unwilling to listen to The Spock; he just doesn't want his own argument to lose legs in the process.\nAlso, the McCoy exists as a counterpart to The Spock. If they are the moral center of the team in general too, then they are The Heart as well. Likely to be the Red Oni in a Red Oni, Blue Oni combination. Closely related to the McCoy are Hot-Blooded and Agent Mulder. Probably sides with the Romanticists in Romanticism Versus Enlightenment.\nThe McCoy is Honor Before Reason personified, and may occasionally be a Strawman Emotional. Will sometimes use I'm a Doctor, Not a Placeholder.\n"}
{"MysteriousStranger": "Some characters first appear with most or all of their identifying traits withheld from the other characters and the audience. They likely won't be greeted by other characters as friend/lover/family/colleague/boss. Their faces and forms are often hidden in shadow or actual disguise. Their very presence may go unnoticed by some or all of the other characters. Yet they keep appearing: the author repeatedly mentions them in the text; the camera focuses on them and follows their actions. The audience (and perhaps one or more of the characters) is wondering, \"Who are you?\" That's the point.\nWithholding information in this fashion piques the audience's curiosity. Without it, the audience can't form solid expectations about the character. Part of the plot development may also be in doubt, or else solving the mystery of this character becomes the plot. Or one of several. The audience and the other characters may be let in on the secret in tandem, or the audience may learn the truth first and the characters only find out later. Then again, some secrets are never revealed.\nMysterious Strangers can be a source of surprise for both other characters and the audience, often by displaying an unexpected talent or triggering a plot twist. They may be a source of information via an anonymous phone call or a written note. They may even secretly provide the heroes with material resources. They may come forward at a key moment, throwing the villain off guard or giving the hero a much-needed respite.\nThe precise nature of their secret(s) will determine their role in the story. Subtropes to this include:\nNot to be confused with the Mark Twain novella of the same name.\n"}
{"MoneySink": "A desirable but expensive item commonly found in MMORPGs and some single player games. It often has no game play significance except to remove virtual money from the economy. Especially true of many intangible goods, like fees, tolls, and the like, because they can't be resold back into the economy.\nMoney sinks are important in many virtual economies as a method to control inflation. When currency is constantly being added to the economy from Money Spiders, quests, etc., if there weren't a method of getting rid of it for good, prices for player-traded goods and services would theoretically grow without limit. New players (and those without large amounts of time to devote to acquiring money) would be unable to compete. Hence, as a game goes on, developers will often introduce more and more expensive ways for players to dispose of excess cash. It also saves your money from becoming useless once you have bought everything there is to buy.\nExists almost solely to avert Money for Nothing. See Cash Gate for when this is required to advance in the game. Not to be confused with Crack Is Cheaper.\n"}
{"EarCleaning": "Also known as Mimikaki, ear cleaning is a mostly Asian practice, as generally Asian peoples' ear wax is harder and more lumpy than westerners'. It uses an ear pick (often shown with a puffy, cotton-ball like thing on the end) to remove wax from the inside of the ear. Because having this done to you by another person is considered intimate (and includes a free bonus of Lap Pillow), this is usually seen in anime and manga between parents and children, siblings, or two people who are lovers. As such it can be used for variations of Does This Remind You of Anything?, Visual Innuendo and even Accidental Innuendo.\nIt's a pleasant experience akin to having one's back scratched, and the sight of someone cleaning out another's ears is almost always an indication of a close, warm relationship.\nIn India and Pakistan you can even find people who will clean your ears for a small fee, usually around 50 rupees (around 75 US cents or 40 British pennies). This is done in India by the kaan maeliye, a subcaste of the Dalits, and recipients of the service unanimously agree it can be very pleasant and surprisingly relaxing. One American recipient tells his story here.\n(Note that this method of cleaning your ears is not exactly medically approved, due to the risk of getting things stuck or potentially perforating your eardrums. Not that it stops anyone...)\n"}
{"BreastEnlargement": "A character suddenly finds their breasts enlarged to often immense levels, via Applied Phlebotinum, magic, science, or otherwise. Mostly happens to flat-chested characters suffering from A-Cup Angst, though women on the other side of the spectrum may have it happen as well. When played for fanservice, the actual growth tends to be as important as the final size of the breasts. It is also frequently played for comedy, but this still ends up providing Fanservice. An Overnight Age-Up for women usually guarantees this will happen.\nIf the expansion is merely caused by puberty, there's a separate trope for that. If the expansion is done on a meta-level, see Adaptational Curves. An alternative is Fake Boobs.\n"}
{"EducationalShort": "Educational Shorts are short stand-alone programs designed to convey a moral about something within the space of a standard commercial break. Often shown at the tail-end of American Saturday morning cartoon shows, or during the commercial breaks in-between shows. Parodied often elsewhere (who can forget those \"Knowledge Is Power\" G.I. Joe shorts, or their various spoofs?). The television versions were first created as a form of commercial during the early days of TV, where commercials actually tried to inform the viewing audience of the uses of a product, instead of simply making the product attractive through glitz and glamour.\nAnother form of educational short is the short film produced for classroom instruction, typically on some topic related to science or health, or possibly drivers' ed. Another ripe subject for parody, or used to characterize teachers as disengaged.\nCompare And Knowing Is Half the Battle.\n Live-Action TV\n Western Animation\n"}
{"KeeperOfForbiddenKnowledge": "\n\n\nA subtrope of Knowledge Broker and Collector of the Strange, the Keeper of Forbidden Knowledge is a being, organization, or even an Eldritch Abomination that contains and sometimes trades information considered either dangerous, blasphemous, epically ground breaking, or any combination of the three. Naturally however, this knowledge comes at a price that makes the trope akin to the Deal with the Devil, and generally leads to disaster for any party involved and then some.\nRegarding what form the forbidden knowledge takes, a Tome of Eldritch Lore is almost expected to be the exception. However, sometimes the knowledge can come in the form of a living creature, memory, or (in a more modern setting) a large selection of files on a super computer. Whatever form the knowledge comes in, it usually (but not always) feels like Sealed Evil in a Can.\nThe Keeper itself is typically something ancient, menacing, or powerful enough that no one can simply ask for the information it has without paying a price. Sometimes the Keeper is a title passed down by an order however, and this is generally the oldest or most intelligent of the conspiracy's agents.\nFinally, the Keeper usually lives in an isolated or hazardous area of the society or region it lives in, a better way to test would-be knowledge seekers of their worth and capability to become puppets for the Keeper's whims, sometimes turning said keeper into a Chess Master.\nThe general moral of stories that revolve around this trope is usually that some things are best left not being known, or that with knowledge comes power, and with power that holds no compassion comes the damning corruption most Keepers of Forbidden Knowledge hope to inspire.\nCompare the much more benevolent Ancient Keeper.\nSee also Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, specifically The Dark Arts.\n"}
{"StrangerInAStrangeSchool": "By mistake or some odd chain of events, an Ordinary High-School Student winds up attending an Extranormal Institute. Perhaps they're a human in an All-Ghouls School, or a muggle in a Wizarding School, but whichever it is, they clearly don't fit in. If the masquerade is in full effect, they'll probably have to try to blend in with the usual type of student, with the consequence of failure ranging from Laser-Guided Amnesia to Cruel and Unusual Death to uphold the masquerade.\nActs as a Na\u00efve Newcomer. After sufficient experience, they may upgrade to something that does fit in.\n"}
{"HiveDrone": "In Real Life, insect drones are males whose only programming is to mate with a queen then die. In fiction, however, \"drone\" is often used to mean a biological equivalent of a remote-controlled robot, such as anything in a Hive Mind not in a position of power, and often under the direct or semi-direct control of the Hive Queen or the Hive Mind's consciousness itself. Sometimes they will resemble hive worker insects and will be sterile, do nothing but work, and care for the Queen's young. Other times they are the army of the Hive. They are nearly always mooks.\nDon't expect them to have individuality, have names other than numbers or letters, or even look different from each other. Sometimes, though, one does break off from the hive for one reason or another, becoming a Rogue Drone.\n"}
{"Medley": "In music, a medley is a piece composed from parts of existing pieces, played one after another, sometimes overlapping. They are common in popular music, and most medleys are songs rather than instrumental. A medley which is a remixed series is called a megamix, often done with tracks for a single artist, or for popular songs from a given year or genre.\nSee also Credits Medley.\n"}
{"ReconstructedTrope": "Deconstruction demonstrates what happens when tropes in fiction are played for realism by revealing all of the trope's possible assumptions after analyzing it. Thus, a fantasy about being a princess or a superhero is shown to have consequences, negatives, other facets, etc that are glazed over in fiction. The trope no longer works the same, so it doesn't look the same and ends up losing value.\nThis is where Reconstruction comes in. A Reconstruction acknowledges the flaws and assumptions of a trope that has undergone Deconstruction, so it either modifies the trope in a way that resembles the original and still work in reality, or finds a solution for the trope to become useful again. So instead, Princess Classic is not being married into a fairy-tale monarchy, but into a post-Napoleonic 19th- or 20th-century one - a constitutional monarchy in Ruritania, with the scenery and regalia but without the power and corruption (or at least with the Princess taking a meaningful stand against it if it is present), so she won't end up like Marie Antoinette.\nThe new age Superhero works the required secondary powers to his advantage to find creative uses for his powers, and carefully balances his mundane and heroic lives, such as working a job that complements his superheroing (or makes it his job by working for a larger group), and dating love interests who are either heroes themselves or able to handle themselves when things get hairy.\nReconstruction can involve deconstructing said Deconstruction if someone has a different idea about \"realism\" or the previous deconstruction was mixed too heavily with Darker and Edgier. Overall, it could be thought of as a dialectical synthesis of an original and its deconstruction. The philosophical theory which accompanies reconstruction is called reconstructivism.\nPlease note that this is not an academically recognised term or concept, having grown out of TV Tropes' own style of media analysis. In academia, a reconstruction would simply be a second deconstruction.\nCompare the Genre Throwback, which usually involves Reconstruction, and Troperiffic works. See also Decon-Recon Switch, which is a single work which sets up a deconstruction only to reconstruct the same tropes later on.\nOften confused with Adaptation Distillation. Reconstruction is when a genre is rebuilt after being hit with a criticism; Adaptation Distillation is when a specific work is revitalized, without any new objections needing to be answered in the process.\nSee also Reimagining the Artifact, a much more localized phenomenon.\nNot to be confused with the Freeware RPG The Reconstruction, season six of Red vs. Blue, or, for that matter, with the Reconstruction Era after The American Civil War.\n Before labeling something as a reconstruction, double check that there has been a deconstruction, that it's not a deconstruction that makes a work Lighter and Softer, and that it's actually realistic.\n"}
{"GenreAnthology": "A show which has no regular characters or actors (but usually many recurring), with the possible exception of a host or narrator who introduces/closes/comments on shows. Stories tend to limit themselves to a single genre but the earlier anthology shows were more likely to cover several genres than later ones.\nA favored format for Horror and suspense, probably because the absence of continuity allows characters to be killed off unpredictably without violating Status Quo Is God.\nCompare/contrast to Thematic Series.\n"}
{"EnslavedElves": "A once-proud and glorious race has fallen. Now, they live in squalor and slavery with few traces of their ancient culture remaining. The only ones that escaped this fate did so by dying or being killed. Perhaps they will rediscover their old pride and power, for better or for worse...\nThis trope only applies if there's some proof that the race used to be a proud and noble one, before their 'fall'. If a universe's elves (though not always elves, most are however) have always been nomadic tribes of pointy-eared barbarian bowmen, it doesn't count for this trope, no matter how badly they're oppressed and see the violence Inherent in the System.\nA subtrope of Screw You, Elves! and could be considered meta-revenge against Can't Argue with Elves. It can overlap with Slave Race.\n"}
{"LongHairedPrettyboy": "How do you make a Pretty Boy even prettier? Give him long (shoulder-length or longer), flowing tresses of glossy hair! Bonus points for wearing it loose, no matter how impractical this may be.\nA lot of these fall under Viewer Gender Confusion, because Long Hair Is Feminine (if the confusion occurs in-universe, it's an example of Dude Looks Like a Lady). Many fall under Mr. Fanservice. This trope is very popular in Anime and Manga, especially those either aimed at girls/women, or are hoping to attract a significant female Periphery Demographic.\nRelated to Rapunzel Hair. Contrast Barbarian Long Hair when it's used in a Hunk.\n"}
{"SuperTough": "The power of unambiguously superhuman durability, ranging from being \"merely\" Immune to Bullets, to getting hit by a nuke and finding it to tickle a bit, and even beyond that.\nThis is a Required Secondary Power to be able to do anything with Super Strength; without it, Newton's Third Law would result in you ruining your hand every time you threw a super-punch, and every bone and muscle would snap/tear under the tension of lifting a car.\nA Sub-Trope of Nigh-Invulnerability (specifically, the Made of Diamond type). Compare Made of Iron, where an explicitly non-superpowered character can take a lot more punishment than is normally possible for no apparent or explained reason, though Charles Atlas Superpower can blur the line between Made of Iron and Super Toughness.\nThis applies to a lot of superpowered powerhouses, Flying Brick-type characters, as well as many of those who utilize extensive cybernetic enhancement, Ki Attacks, Supernatural Martial Arts, and/or Functional Magic. It's sometimes a side-effect of particularly adaptive Healing Factors. Most Super Soldiers possess it, and it can also be achieved with Mind over Matter.\nCombine it with Super Strength, and you're likely to end up with the Implacable Man. Often part of Super Speed users as well as per Required Secondary Powers, as anyone with otherwise ordinary human physiology would literally tear themselves apart very quickly. When it's just their skeleton see Unbreakable Bones.\n"}
{"TooManyLoveInterests": "Not to be confused with Harem Genre, a genre of Japanese media that sometimes heavily relies on this trope.\nThis trope involves a common reaction from the man when a Harem plot begins and women start fighting for his attention. He might either think like a Celibate Hero, that the gratuitous quantity of boobs he is forced to see every day are just a bother (Comically Missing the Point that he is in an enviable situation), or see them as an obstacle between him and the girl he truly likes, or he may just find them annoying for one reason or another.\nThe more likely reason plot-wise is the fact that the male lead cannot reciprocate all the girls' feelings without seeming to the audience to be cruel, manipulative, and misleading to the girls. So the far easier solution is to make him oblivious to their affection or Cursed with Awesome.\nEven if he does like one or more of the girls, the man won't or can't admit it. Besides, until the point comes where one of the girls is in danger, the man would rather have his nice quiet life back. The trope may or may not involve Innocent Cohabitation.\nWhile this is, as might be gathered, usually a male trope, gender-reversed versions have recently begun to appear.\nAs shown by poor Tsukune in the above picture, the most common and immediate consequences of said harem is the ever-hilarious (if incredibly painful to watch) Lover Tug-of-War.\nWhen criticism is raised against a harem show it's usually due to an overdose of this trope; unfortunately, when played straight, this trope is almost always overdosed. While it's often criticized as blatant Wish Fulfillment, most criticism regards the tendency to portray the female cast very negatively, often giving them little personality, or having their characters largely defined by their dependency on the male protagonist and/or irrational tendencies towards violence.\nContrast Harem Seeker, where the \"unwanted\" part is left out. Also compare Sexy Man, Instant Harem, which may or may not be wanted, but which usually involves more superficial characters.\nResolutions to such a situation are varied.\n"}
{"CombatDiplomacyStealth": "A form of gameplay non-linearity, found mostly in Role-Playing Games, wherein the player can beat individual levels or subquests, or even the entire game by sticking to one of the three playing styles:\nThis trope is about having to choose between these three approaches, not about having a specialist for each in the Player Party \u2014 for that, see Cast Speciation.\nCompare Fighter, Mage, Thief. Contrast RPGs Equal Combat and Useless Useful Non-Combat Abilities, where non-combat paths are available in theory but rendered useless by the game design.\n"}
{"WebSerialNovel": "Also known as \"webfiction\" or the \"online novel\", web serial novels are the prose equivalent of webcomics which happen to have distinct Story Arcs. An author, usually an amateur, publishes a novel in many short installments (often daily or weekly) on a website.\nQuite often, the work in question is some sort of Fan Fic, but also included in this category are completely original works. Most long-form Fan Fic is posted on places like Fan Fiction Dot Net in installments, and thus would qualify as this trope.\nWeb serials are the Spiritual Successors to the Serial Novels which Charles Dickens (and many other authors of that time) originally published in serial form in newspapers and in Dime Novel form.\nSee Web Fiction Guide and Muses Success for incomplete listings of serial novels, among other forms of online prose fiction. Top Web Fiction keeps a list of active/popular English-language web serials, employing a weekly voting system in order to stay consistently current.\nIn the years leading up to The New '10s, Japanese-language \"web novels\" began to attract attention from publishers - Recuts of these stories now make up a significant chunk of the Light Novel market, and in turn a number of these have gone on to become mainstream hits with anime and manga adaptations. Shousetsuka ni Narou (\"Let's Become a Novelist\") is one of the most popular hubs for this in Japan, with over a hundred of the works on the site having been adopted for publication.\nPlease note that these works go in the Literature/ namespace, and not Web Original.\n"}
{"NotNowBernard": "The kind of thing useless adults will say to a Kid Hero or child who has some rather urgent news. This pint sized Cassandra will be shooed away from grownup company or harangued for being \"Just a Kid\" before even getting one word out. This isn't necessarily limited to just children either; a pretentious character can silence a friend or underling in this manner, or a grown woman when the men don't take women seriously. This can also be used as a put down to annoying characters when two more powerful/important characters are discussing something. The kid will get interrupted after the word \"but.\"\nExasperatingly, the shusher may even scold the shushee later for not speaking up! And for even more frustration, the Very Important Grown-Up Things the grown-ups would much rather do or talk about may be completely asinine.\nUsually, the very thing the child/friend/underling was trying to say turns out to be significant or important, and the hero will regret having brushed it off. In darker examples the brush-off leads the hero into greater danger by blundering directly into the situation he could've been aware of in advance; or worse, the person making the warning is put in grave danger (or killed) since he or she was asking for help.\nSee also Cassandra Truth, when the warning is heard but often sounds incredible and is subsequently dismissed until it's too late; Crying Wolf, when the warning is heard but dismissed because of the prankish messenger; and Evil-Detecting Dog, when the warning is made by an animal (and may be either recognized or dismissed). See also, Glad I Thought of It. A subtrope of Poor Communication Kills. Compare Poorly Timed Confession. If a character applies this to someone that seems like a victim (but isn't really), then it is The Victim Must Be Confused.\nContrast Kid Has a Point.\nIf the kid in question is mistakenly thought to be dead, that's the subtrope Not Now, We're Too Busy Crying over You.\n"}
{"RealityWarp": "Ever heard of the Superpower Lottery? Well, kid, you just won the grand prize. You know those pesky laws of physics? Or that annoying thing called causality? Einstein's theory of relativity? Quantum physics? You can laugh and say, \"screw you\" to them now.\nReality is officially out to lunch, and you've picked the restaurant and menu it gets to \"choose\". This means you can create things out of nothing, change already existing things, erase things from existence, and generally force reality to obey your will just by thinking about it. Yes, for all intents and purposes, a Reality Warper can literally make and do anything they want. Anything.\nThe key issue here is how far one can take this. A character with a mild form of this power may be able to fly by negating the effect of gravity on himself. A major case of this may be able to hiccup and accidentally tear the space-time continuum. High-end Reality Warpers tend to be related to the setting itself, such as being one of the sentient cosmic laws. For the really high-end ones, see The Omnipotent.\nNeedless to say, running into characters with such powers can be incredibly chancy. Arguing with the more powerful ones may well be futile, especially since they can literally, in the words of Paul from The Dungeonmaster (or Adam Savage), reject your reality and substitute their own.\nBecause absolute power corrupts absolutely, characters with this high a level of power are quite likely to go or be bad. They might even deem themselves to be gods; what's worse, even the only moderately powerful ones are arguably right.\nIn both modern Speculative Fiction and older folklore, low-to-moderate versions of Reality Warper are standard-issue for magic, since magic by definition uses its own rules, and therefore defies reality. Therefore, various supernatural beings, especially magical or divine ones such as gods, elves, and genies, are almost always this. The common modern fantasy concept of a granting wishes invokes this premise; *poof* and stuff happens. Cartoon characters also often employ this ability as a gag. Eldritch Abominations are often capable of this, usually to horrible ends. Many authors however will make Eldritch beings \"beyond\" reality warpers and even worse than the warpers themselves. Expect accidentally summoning one of these beings to be an unintended side-effect of warping reality, the abomination will likely go on to be the new antagonist shorty after doing something to the warper.\nProtagonists aren't often this character type; what's the point of a story when you can just end it right then and there? If the protagonist is one of these, expect him or her to either have a reason for not using it or for all of the antagonists to have powers on a similar or greater scale. Also expect initial Power Incontinence resulting from the power not necessarily being limited to his conscious thoughts, and a character arc about the importance of self control.\nWriting characters like this can be a challenge, given how easily this ability can turn into a Story-Breaker Power. Nothing can pose much of a physical threat except other reality warpers (although, depending on the extent of their abilities, they may still be vulnerable to threats they aren't aware they need to stop or don't know how to stop). If they are unique then the only solution is Forgot About His Powers or Deus Exit Machina. For the same reasons, reality warpers who are antagonistic towards the protagonists are prone to Just Toying with Them. For a funny way of defeating reality warpers, see Puff of Logic.\nNot to be confused with Master of Illusion, as those are only pretending to change or create things (although a reality warper is usually capable of creating illusions, the tropes overlap in that case). Reality warpers often incorporate all varieties of shapeshifting, Winds of Destiny, Change, Space/Time Master, The Power of Creation, and perhaps more for heaps and heaps of Mind Screwing.\nCompare Author Powers, Clap Your Hands If You Believe, and Your Mind Makes It Real. Rewriting Reality is a subtrope, often paired with a Tome of Fate or Reality-Writing Book. This trope has nothing to do with I Reject Your Reality, though some Warpers may indeed have that attitude.\nWhen adding examples, please remember that this trope is extremely common (since even magic in general is technically this trope) so please add only egregious examples, and works that elaborate upon this trope In-Universe or have this trope as a Plot Device. After all, Reality Warping Is Not a Toy.\n"}
{"YouCouldHaveUsedYourPowersForEvil": "\"You Could Have Used Your Powers For Good / Evil\" is a sentiment often expressed to the Worthy Opponent. Hero Bob wonders why Villain Alice, with her immense power, chose to do evil rather than good. If the evildoer is a recurring character, rather than a one-shot, this usually comes followed by a conversation about how they're Not So Different and a Heel\u2013Face Turn would make her feel much better about her life.note\u00a0(Mind the Redemption Equals Death)\nOf course, the reverse can also occur, with Alice questioning why Bob bothers to protect these ungrateful weaklings when he could just use his powers to take whatever he wants. If Alice succeeds in convincing him that Evil Feels Good, Bob may become a Fallen Hero.\nAs the page quote illustrates, this is more appropriate for some villains than others. Usually they need to have \"good\" powers yet use them for evil. Of course it's not impossible for a Bob to try to convince Alice that even with \"bad\" powers she has a great responsibility and she can be a good person. If Alice is a Mad Scientist, cutting her a check while commenting how all her evil inventions are useless can have this effect.\nCompare Recruiting the Criminal, Win Your Freedom and Boxed Crook, where a villain is forced into acting for good; also Cut Lex Luthor a Check, where acting good would have obvious monetary benefits. If the character listens to this advice, they're a Moral Pragmatist.\nContrast: Then Let Me Be Evil, where villains attempt to use their powers for good, only for their treatment by others to cause them to turn to evil; also Comes Great Responsibility, Comes Great Insanity, and Comes Great Perks, where power changes a character's disposition all by itself. Also, the Stock Phrase: \"Aren't you glad I use my powers for good than evil?\", often humorously, and often for a mundane skill rather than an actual superpower.\n"}
{"YouKnowWhatTheySay": "A Stock Phrase.\nWhen referring to a specific group, refer to You Know What They Say About X...\nWhen the character refers to himself saying something, regardless of whether or not he actually does in the series, the trope is It's Like I Always Say.\n"}
{"PersonofMassDestruction": "A Person of Mass Destruction is a character with powers, abilities, or skills capable of causing damage on the level of a Weapon of Mass Destruction. As a Speculative Fiction trope, it is frequently used as a metaphor for real-world technology \u2014 often nuclear weapons. The source of their destructive powers varies; they may have won the Superpower Lottery, have knowledge of Things Man Was Not Meant to Know or be a Physical God. What gives them their destructive potential is less important than the fact that they have it.\nThe reaction to a PoMD is often fear, anger, and hate, which may cross over into outright abuse. Despite this, their chances of being either a Hero or a Villain are about the same, and depend on whether they believe With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility or Might Makes Right. A person of mass destruction is more likely than normal to undergo Superpower Meltdown at some point, channeling the fear of losing control of a conventional weapon of mass destruction, as with an Empty Quiver situation.\nThey will almost always score at least as a Class 4 on the Super Weight scale or higher.\nCompare with Human Weapon, for when someone is literally treated as a weapon. See also Destructive Saviour and Walking Disaster Area.\n"}
{"CardsOfPower": "A form of Ancient Artifact, Cards of Power are small, rigid pieces of paper or cardboard which possess paranormal or magical powers. The abilities they possess vary widely from one narrative to another. In some works, they can summon creatures or monsters. In others, they are used to cast spells or as a Transformation Trinket. They are also often tarot cards and may use Tarot Motifs. If the cards are always shuffled, this can be a way to create risk in casting spells - you know you'll get something, but it's impossible to know what.\nA Sub-Trope is Ofuda, a Shinto talisman of protection.\nCompare Death Dealer, when the cards are used as physical weapons.\nFor a version specific to video games, see Fight Like a Card Player.\n"}
{"StarCrossedLover": "Two lovers\u2014often but not always teenagers\u2014doomed to be kept apart no matter how hard they struggle to be together. It may be Fate, or fatally-Feuding Families, or it may be something as mundane as a few hundred miles' separation, but something will always be in their way. Often, the two can only be Together in Death. William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is the most famous example (and the Trope Namer), but the archetype dates at least as far back as Mesopotamian Mythology and Egyptian Mythology, making it Older Than Dirt.\nIn modern times, the term \"star-crossed\" is often unknowingly misused to mean lovers who are meant to be together. It means just the opposite\u2014the stars (i.e. destiny or the heavens) have ruled against them, or \"crossed\" their plan. Compare the word \"disaster\", which has the etymology \"away; without\" (\"dis\") + \"star; planet\" (\"aster\"). Then again, if the stars rule that much, they probably decreed the love as well as the impossibility, making the stars capricious and cruel at the very least. It also refers to destiny and the inevitability of the two characters' paths crossing each other. It usually, but not always, refers to unlucky outcomes, since Romeo and Juliet's affair ended tragically. Further, it may also connote that the lovers entered into their union without sufficient forethought or preparation, that they did not have adequate knowledge of each other, or that they were not thinking rationally (because they were being controlled by fate).\nOne common version of this trope, Love Above One's Station (i.e., being in love with someone from a different social class), is at least discredited if not actually dead and buried in contemporary settings, but was very much true in the past, and can still work when applied to historical settings. While it's difficult even today to have a relationship with someone from a very different background, in the old days, it was all but impossible: if you were from the lower class and courted your \"better\", you'd be treated with the vilest contempt and risk arrest and/or violence (possibly even death); meanwhile, a \"better\" who reciprocated would be disowned and possibly shut off in a nunnery, a monastery\u2014or even an asylum.\nHence all those tragic \"servant/slave/peasant loves the lord/lady/king/queen, and their Love Ruins the Realm\" stories. The accepted practice for someone in love with a royal, at least in contemporary fiction, was to express that love through loyalty and duty rather than presume to have a romantic relationship with them.\nForbidden Love and its sub-tropes are often the reason two lovers are star-crossed. May be used as a Pretext for War. One of the top reasons for a Balcony Wooing Scene.\nContrast Love Transcends Spacetime and Nobody Thinks It Will Work, where the power of love overcomes.\n"}
{"AdventureBoardGames": "Adventure board games are a subset of Board Games where each player controls a personified character token whose abilities improve as the game progresses (through leveling, items, or both). \"Personified\" here means that the characters usually have unique names, distinct appearances, and specialized abilities\u2014just like in a Tabletop RPG, although pen-and-paper RPGs are easily distinct by their free-form gameplay that does not require a board. Cooperative ABGs also often feature Asymmetric Multiplayer (with one player functioning as a \"Game Master\" controlling monsters and traps), Variable Player Goals, and varying session goals (\"quests\").\nAdventure board games' origins are tightly intertwined with tabletop RPGs, as their Ur-Example, Dungeon! (1975), had been a competing design to the original Dungeons & Dragons (1974). In The '80s, the genre split into three distinct subgenres all of which are represented on the market to this today:\nBecause most adventure board games are deeply rooted in a fantasy or a horror theme, they are often classified as Ameritrash Games, although after the Turn of the Millennium, Euro Game mechanics started seeping into the genre, particularly through Fantasy Flight Games' productions. Another trend is adapting popular video games, particularly CRPGs, to tabletop format.\nAdventure Video Games are something entirely different. The closest video game equivalents to this genre are actually Hero Shooters and MOBAs.\n"}
{"SnobsVsSlobs": "They are well groomed, clean, stylishly dressed, and treat those around as inferior, be it at a Renaissance court or a slum. They are scruffy, dirty, dressed entirely from the used clothes discount pile, and act like boorish rabble, rolling their eyes at the uptight.\nThey will usually be in close proximity, at least in the same neighborhood, city, or space sector. And of course they fight. The scale of the conflict can be any size, be it a clique vs. clique social power struggle in a school, a street brawl between rival gangs, or two species or even Planet of Hats at war. When cranked Up to Eleven, it can cross into armed revolution, or either Kill the Poor or Eat the Rich.\nBeyond the superficial dichotomy this conflict is one of lifestyle and worldview. The Snobs are epicurean, refined, and educated \u2014 but classist and vain, while Slobs are honest, revelrous and dionysian \u2014 but violent and dangerous.\nAs a narrative device, Slobs vs. Snobs rarely presents both sides equally. More often than not, the Slobs are presented in a more sympathetic light than the Snobs. Even then, there are often good and bad attributes associated with both positions, and many uses of this trope end with An Aesop that Both Sides Have a Point and can learn from each other to become better people. Occasionally, though, they\u2019re both shown to be equally terrible.\nOn the Sliding Scale of Shiny Versus Gritty, Snobs would be shiny and Slobs would be gritty.\nCompare/see also Elves vs. Dwarves and Fur Against Fang, where the Snobs will be elves or vampires, and the Slobs will be Dwarves or Werewolves respectively. (Though vampire elves and werewolf dwarves aren't out of the question, nor for that matter are Elven Vampire Werewolves). The trope Rich Suitor, Poor Suitor is what happens when you mix slobs vs snobs with a love triangle. Technician vs. Performer is a similar trope in the entertainment world. See also They Fight Crime!.\nSubtrope of Harmony Vs Discipline, Foil, and Red Oni, Blue Oni.\n"}
{"CAMP": "Derives from the French gay community's slang term se camper, meaning \"to pose in an exaggerated fashion\". The term \"Camp\" morphed into referring to a sensibility that revels in artifice, stylization, theatricality, irony, playfulness, and exaggeration rather than content, as Susan Sontag famously defined the term in her short essay \"Notes on Camp\". Don't expect it to take itself the least bit seriously.\nThe main debates concerning the term are twofold:\nSee also Camp Gay, Macho Camp and Camp Straight. Compare So Bad, It's Good, Stylistic Suck and Narm Charm. Related to Large Ham and World of Ham. Not to be confused with the movie Camp (2003), nor has anything to do with a Camping Episode.\n"}
{"HandSeals": "Hand Seals, aka kuji-in (literally means \"nine syllables seal\") are ritualistic hand gestures that are commonly used as part of a magic formula, with roots in Taoism. They are similar to Mudras originating from Hinduism, another type of symbolic hand-gestures (but can include other parts of the body). Also ninjas, and others who use them often also Call their Attacks, so they may be considered Mantras as well.\nThis trope is popular in Japan (and China), as they're the source of the trope. However, you can expect some works from other countries feature this as well, often parodied. One of the ninja cliches (along with smoke bombs, kabuki stagehand costumes, and shurikens), but sometimes monks also do this as well, especially when meditating.\nThe mostly used hand gesture in works is the index and middle finger of both hands pointed up, while the ring and little finger wrap the other hand, as shown above. Another variant is the clap palms, more commonly used by monks. Sometimes a one-hand variant is also used.\nSubtrope of Magical Gesture.\nCompare Pstandard Psychic Pstance and Asian Rune Chant.\n"}
{"PermanentlyMissableContent": "These components frequently appear in areas that can only be accessed once, or are rendered unavailable after a certain plot event occurs. The town that is destroyed, the mountainous area that caves in once you leave, the area that your characters are restricted from accessing after a certain point for plot reasons, the Load-Bearing Boss's hideout that explodes after you defeat them, the ship that departs after your trip is finished and never returns, and so forth. These components may also become missable for a random or arbitrary reason (such as an NPC related to the component suddenly disappearing after a certain point in a game).\nDue to their tendency to induce great frustration, smart developers tend to avoid implementing these, and allow the player to collect items or do sidequests at their own leisure. Sometimes, this can result in silly situations where the player is presented with the option of returning to a location where there would be no logical reason to in the context of the game's plot, but, really, it's the lesser of the two evils.\nNot to be confused with Final Death, where a character dies permanently and cannot be resurrected. Also not to be confused with Awesome, but Temporary, where a component is deliberately taken away from the player. If a Plot Coupon is permanently missable, the game becomes Unwinnable by Design. May be a result of Point of No Return, where the game cuts the player off from accessing earlier areas. Bonus Stage Collectables may become permanently missable if the Bonus Stage can only be played once. Permanently missable items are often found in a One-Time Dungeon. If the player has the choice of one item resulting in the others becoming permanently missable, they are Mutually Exclusive Powerups.\nIf the content (or even the entire game) is truly permanently missable because it is/was released online for a limited time before being taken down, that's Temporary Online Content.\n"}
{"DiedinyourArmsTonight": "Death Is Dramatic, depressing, and emotional enough, but sometimes, just for the extra emotional kick-in-the-gut Tear Jerker, the author will make a character die in the arms of a helpless onlooker. As the onlooker (usually one of the dying character's True Companions) holds them dearly, the dying may flash them a smile or make a final dramatic statement before finally closing their eyes and succumbing to their fate.\nIf this is done on an Anyone Can Die show, expect the character to be Killed Off for Real (usually). Can turn into It's Personal for the witness, and very often overlaps with How Dare You Die on Me! and Dying Declaration of Love. May be an extension of the refusal to let your loved one Die Alone.\nCompare with Piet\u00e0 Plagiarism, the pose characters generally find themselves in, Cradling Your Kill, when a character dies in their killer's arms, and Deadly Hug, where the victim is killed during the embrace. Contrast Intimate Healing, where a wounded or ill character is less likely to die while in a loved one's arms. At least, not literally. (Though strangely enough, intimacy is exactly what's being referenced by the Cutting Crew song.) May overlap with Cradle of Loneliness, especially if the body of a loved one is cradled long after their death.\nThis is a Death Trope, so be warned that UNMARKED SPOILERS abound.\n"}
{"CastFullOfWriters": "A show or movie where the main cast also serve as the writers of the piece. Common in Sketch Comedy, as well as Video Review Shows and Internet Abridged Series due to their one-man-show nature. The trope can crop up in other types of show as well; it's especially common in Sit Coms, as sitcom writers often have backgrounds in performance (specifically stand-up and/or sketch comedy) and are susceptible to being called upon to act.\nWhen actors get their first writing credit on series they're already starring in, that's Written by Cast Member.\n"}
{"PalmFistTap": "Sometimes when a character has an Idea Bulb moment, he may reflect it by holding one hand (usually the left) out and tapping the palm with the other fist.\nOften the action is accompanied by a sound effect: a \"bop\" or a \"bing\". The Japanese onomatopoeia for the drum is oberobero. Anime producers often use the sound of a tsuzumi drum hit.\nCompare Idea Bulb and Beam of Enlightenment.\n"}
{"RandomPowerRanking": "A simplistic ranking system in which Power Levels are something other than specific measurements, usually in the form of broad categories.\nMuch like Character Tiers, this discussion centers on which character(s) are the most powerful. Unlike Character Tiers this happens inside the show/game and does not get deeply involved in the factors affecting the debate.\nInevitably, any series with this kind of grading system will be subject to Rank Inflation, sometimes to ridiculous levels just to keep up with things like the Sorting Algorithm of Evil. In the end the heroes will always be as Strong as They Need to Be, so all this rigamarole can get beside the point.\nCompare Awesomeness Meter. Distinct from Power Levels which are specific measurements, this trope deals with less specific things. For example, if a character was rated at \"709 in Ki Manipulation\", that's Power Levels. But if they were rated a \"Class 2 (of 5) in Ki Manipulation\" that's this trope.\nCommon scales include:\n"}
{"GoshdarnItToHeck": "In some family-oriented shows and movies, instead of using completely made-up swear words, real but relatively mild cuss words, such as \"hell\" and \"damn\", will get promoted to the top of the swearing ladder. To make up for the situation, they may use a Bowdlerisation of it.\nContrary to popular belief, the words \"damn\" and \"hell\" are permissible in a G-rated film. For example, the 1971 movie Airport had both (\"Where the hell are you?\" and \"You've always got some damn excuse!\") and it still received a G rating, though movie-rating standards have changed since then. Even some G-rated animated features, such as Sleeping Beauty, The Secret of NIMH, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, have included mild swear words. However, it is worth noting that \"Hell\" can refer to the place and \"damn\" can mean condemnation to said place, and thus are not swear words even if such concepts are a little heavy for children. \"Bitch\" (the official term for a female dog - from which the derogatory use is derived) and \"ass\" (an alternate name for a donkey) almost never get such passes, unless it is explicit and obvious that the non-swear meaning is intended.\nWhile \"damn\" is normally permissible, \"goddamn\" is considered blasphemous amongst more conservative Christian sects and so might be seen as on par with \"fuck\", if not worse, resulting in literal examples of *Bleep*-dammit!. (This is particularly true in the US.) The M*A*S*H movie when shown on TV has had Sergeant Gorman's Catch-Phrase, \"Goddamn Army\" bowdlerised to \"Damn Army\".\nSome words are considered acceptable in some cultures but not in others, and this may appear in G- or PG-rated contexts in one place, but generate complaint in others. For example, in the UK the word \"bloody\" is considered to be quite a strong swear word when used as an epithet; elsewhere it's not an issue. Also in the UK, the word \"ass\" is rarely used; instead, the word \"arse\" is used, and it's considered a mild swear. In North America, \"arse\" is used as a non-offensive variant of \"ass\" in the same context as using \"heck\" instead of \"hell.\"\nThe use of \"Hades\" as an old-fashioned synonym for \"Hell\" is theologically correct, in the right context, but is commonly misused in any context in which \"hell\" would work. Using Hades as Satan is never correct though. See The Underworld article for other terms that may be substituted in this manner in works based on other theological settings.\nThe kid-friendly variant of Bowdlerise. A favorite tool of the Badbutt, a G-rated badass. Another character type known for this is the Minnesota Nice.\nCompare Country Matters, which is where a medium takes great lengths to avoid not general cuss words, but one word in particular which is seen as immensely offensive and explicit.\nContrast Cluster F-Bomb which is the exact opposite. See also Big, Stupid Doodoo-Head, Curse of the Ancients, Mondegreen, Never Say \"Die\", T-Word Euphemism, Unusual Euphemism, and the Wikipedia article on minced oaths.\nNote: This is a page for listing moments where swearing is deliberately censored or a replacement to a real world swear word is used. It is not a page to list moments where swearing would have looked cool, or for moments where you believe swearing would have improved a line.\n"}
{"MysteryCult": "Popular in ancient Greece and Rome, Mystery Cults are ultra-exclusive \"clubs\" that require total secrecy on the part of participants and may tell new members little or nothing about their ethos before they join, and often long after. Generally speaking only long-time members will know what the cult is actually about, and even then the \"Inner Circle\" will be the only ones who know everything. In this respect they are the opposite of some religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism, which are more evangelical and make materials relating to their beliefs freely available and are happy to explain what they believe.\nAs a general rule initiates don't have a clue what they have gotten themselves into and the inner circle won't be keen on telling. This is often a lead in to a really obvious Religion of Evil. The Path of Inspiration is a particular type of evil mystery cult which employs trappings of a benevolent religion to disguise itself. Compare and contrast Ancient Conspiracy. See also Secret Circle of Secrets.\nIncidentally, the formal term for an initiate of a mystery cult is \"mystes\" (plural \"mystae\").\nNote: As a general rule this trope only applies to things that are described as a cult, religion, or sect, etc, In-Universe or by Word of God.\n"}

{"BossInMooksClothing": "This is a gameplay trope, not a narrative trope. Unless the character a) has specs mentioned in some way, and b) is explicitly stated to not be a boss, then no story examples are valid. This trope is also therefore not possible in real life.\nMooks in video games typically aren't supposed to be too hard on their own. They are usually just there to soften up the heroes before the Boss Battle of a level (usually). But there are exceptions, enemies that are annoying, dangerous, and/or powerful. This trope is the top tier of these, enemies that are so powerful, you wouldn't be blamed for mistaking them for bosses (hence the trope name).\nFor example, let's say you are playing an Eastern RPG. You're walking along on your quest to save the world, when you run into a Random Encounter with a three-headed, skeletal dragon. You're 12 levels higher than the average enemy here, so just give it a few attacks, and it should be over with.\nBut not only is it still standing after three turns, but most of your party has lost over half their health. So you don't hold back. You launch your best spells and special attacks at it, using your healer's super expensive full party heal spell. Eventually, it goes down, but not before you had to resurrect the mage twice, and you had to use up two-thirds of your total magic point pool. Time to warp to the nearest Trauma Inn.\nIn order to determine if a regular enemy qualifies, it must have at least two of the following traits. It can be any of these traits, but it must have two or more.\nCompare and contrast Demonic Spiders, which tends to be a common enemy, whereas a Boss in Mook Clothing tends to be fairly uncommon. Compare Smash Mook, That One Boss, Kung Fu-Proof Mook, Mini-Boss. Contrast Goddamned Bats, King Mook, Mook Promotion, Anticlimax Boss, Degraded Boss, Level in Boss Clothing, Killer Rabbit, and Fake Ultimate Mook.\nNot to be confused with Bonus Boss or Bitch in Sheep's Clothing.\nBefore Editing: Check to see if Elite Mook or King Mook is a better fit for your example.\n"}
{"IJustWriteTheThing": "A step down from the Literary Agent Hypothesis, this is an author who speaks about the events in their stories as if they had no control over them. The author claims heartbreak when a character gets Killed Off for Real, commiserates with the fans over the Ship Sinking, laments when Character Derailment strikes, and rants along with the fans at characters' What an Idiot! moments. Often becomes prominent when Cerebus Syndrome strikes.\nJustified to a certain extent: The Rule of Drama dictates that what makes the best story isn't always the easiest thing to write. The author might know that killing off Bob is the most exciting/logical/dramatic/marketable course of action, but we can assume that as an author, they like their character and will suffer a bit of heartache over it... heartache which is going to be magnified when the move proves to be extremely unpopular, or the fans react with horror and run away screaming, \"That never happened!\"\nThis approach also tends to make an author more accessible to fans, since they come across as just one of the group. However, some fans will call Fridge Logic by pointing out that if the author felt that badly about the turn of events, nobody forced them to write it that way (at least, we assume not). Writers may also risk making hypocrites of themselves if they then dictate exactly what happens in the universe and leave no room for fan speculation, beating down dissenters who write fanfic that goes against canon, or those who note that they preferred the story when it was cute and funny and Bob was still alive.\nA writer who claims they just write the thing usually takes one or both of two different forms:\nIts also important to note that this is not necessarily a case of an author pretending to believe this. As a perusal of the real life section will demonstrate, many of the more successful authors have noted a tendency for their stronger works to \"write themselves\" in bursts of inspiration that they then simply scramble to write down before they forget the idea.\nStephen King, in fact, has mentioned a personal theory that in order to write a truly great work of fiction, an author must embrace this idea. His reasoning is that if a writer can convince themselves on some level, even briefly, that the world they are creating does in fact exist and is not completely within their control, a work ceases to be based purely on Wish Fulfillment and Author Appeal, and begins to tap into the subconscious and random passing thoughts of the author. At this point, a work becomes something that can legitimately surprise even the author, in the same way that a dream can surprise a dreamer. Characters do things that the author doesn't like, events happen because the author doesn't want them to happen, Author Phobias leak into works that were supposed to be lighthearted comedies. At its best, the story is intuitive and satisfying, and the author is less inclined to play favorites and fiddle with their Author Powers to craft Mary Sues and Deus Ex Machinae where convenient.\nSee also Writing by the Seat of Your Pants, which can lead to this. At its source, the Death of the Author theory builds on a variant of this idea, that a writer is a \"conduit\" for a story, and when their work is done their opinion on it is no more important than any other reader's. Can also happen when it\u2019s not the plot or characters but the executives who demand a story be written a certain way, and the author has no choice but to comply- for that, see Executive Meddling.\nCompare Daydream Believer, when the fans take this to its logical conclusion and believe that the fictional characters literally exist somewhere out there.\n"}
{"BoatLights": "When a character has differently colored eyes, it may represent one of the following:\n"}
{"TeamRocket": "A Power Trio made up of a domineering character and two henchmen or Co-Dragons. The two henchmen usually look physically different (one short and fat, the other tall and skinny/buff) in addition to having different skills, often Brains and Brawn or an unreasonable facsimile; the position of boss may be gained simply by assertiveness. Their boss is usually convinced they're master criminals, even though the two subordinate characters usually fit the bill for Stupid Crooks. Terrible Trios are very rarely the real Big Bads, and the whole group tends to be played for comedy in the long run. They may have no dark motivations other than fortune or fame, and it's easy to sympathize with them through their repeated defeats. They usually have a certain degree of Karmic Protection.\nSometimes, there's a higher-up that the team's boss is accountable to. That higher-up is usually closer to True Evil, and considers the team, boss and all, to be ineffective at best. In a more serious story (or if Cerebus Syndrome is about to kick in), expect the goldfish poop to get flushed on most occasions.\nIn many recent anime, the boss is usually more attractive and the opposite gender of the lackeys. The Terrible Trio are often gangsters, who are strangely less competent than the psycho villain.\nSee also Evil Duo, Quirky Miniboss Squad, Big, Thin, Short Trio, Freudian Trio, Comic Trio, Goldfish Poop Gang, Those Two Bad Guys, \u00a1Three Amigos!, and, when two or more Big Bads work together, Big Bad Duumvirate.\n"}
{"DreamingOfThingsGoneBy": "A sleeping character dreams a vision of events past \u2014 sometimes long past \u2014 and certainly ones they never saw.\nWhile they can be hard to fathom, like Dreaming of Things to Come, they are unable to be warded or fought off, since they are long gone. And unlike Dream Spying, the characters are seldom detected by the people they watch. Dream Weavers can send them. When a character is Talking in Your Dreams, the other can show them.\nUsually used to reveal information. They are always, of course, true.\nBeware, though, that sometimes the past is not an era friendly to human sanity.\nMight be explained by the dreaming characters having lived in the past, or having an ancestor living in that past, in which case there are definite limitations to what they will dream of.\nSee Bad Dreams for dreams of the character's past and Exposition of Immortality for when the character actually lived through the past they're dreaming about.\n"}
{"HitPoints": "In most video games centered around combat, Hit Points are a measure of how close to death or incapacitation a character is.\nRather than bothering to simulate realistic injuries, players get a number or Life Meter attributed to their character to indicate their current condition. It's like a time-irrelevant take on Exact Time to Failure in that only losing the last one causes any real harm. Some games (especially Tabletop RPGs) may Hand Wave it as an abstraction of non videogame tropes such as Plot Armor and Heroic Resolve, or actual health vs. injury: As a character's HP drops, it's ostensibly their talent/luck at dodging, deflecting and absorbing the worst blows dropping as they get more tired and desperate, until they actually get hurt badly enough to be out of combat.\nThis trope can be directly traced from the original Dungeons & Dragons, right down to the name. Since then, it's been used in genres as diverse as First-Person Shooter, Role-Playing Game, and Real-Time Strategy, and is nigh-universal for each, due to its usefulness for programmers (the alternative is One-Hit-Point Wonder where any damage is immediately fatal). On some occasions, the number itself is hidden and only a Life Meter is shown to represent damage. Survival Horror games favor foregoing even that, and simply displaying one of three to four colors in the status screen to indicate the player's well-being.\nIn First Person Shooters, this number is often exactly 100, and is taken to be a percentage of the player's normal uninjured health, with \"mega health\"-type items that cause your health to go above 100 often resulting in your health slowly ticking back down to 100. Ever since GoldenEye, players and enemies often take multiples of damage based on where they are hit, but in the end, a bullet in the head is exactly the same as twelve in the foot, or what have you. This also means that eleven hits to the foot will not only not kill you, but often not even impair your movement - after all, it's Only a Flesh Wound. It's a good thing there are so many water fountains and Healing Potions spread about.\nIn many Role Playing Games, you usually get a higher maximum number of Hit Points with each Character Level.\nThey're not always called \"Hit Points,\" sometimes they are called \"Health Points,\" or are collectively referred to as \"Health Power.\" If they have an on-screen abbreviation, it's almost always HP. If individual body parts have hitpoints, that's Sub System Damage. Sometimes entities have Multiple Life Bars, layered in combinations like Regenerating Shield, Static Health or for different types of attacks.\nThey're often displayed in a Life Meter, which is a subtrope.\nOccasionally you'll see something similar in non-game media, like when the Cool Ship in the Space Opera measures its integrity as a single number which represents the status of its Deflector Shields or something.\n"}
{"PopUpTrivia": "You can remember the lines to the catchy tune in the background. You know exactly when the character starts talking to his green candy apple accounting calculator. Then suddenly there is a little noise you have never heard before and a little message on screen about how this calculator doesn't actually exist and the production company had to spend big money to make a fake one.\nYou, my friend, have been introduced to the wonderful world of Pop Up Trivia. Wherein the little tricks that the production people put into making your show are showed off, or interesting but irrelevant but interesting pieces of information are given, such as how many calories a person would burn in 500 miles and how long it would take, but not quite as vocal as a DVD Commentary.\n"}
{"OnlyKnownByHisNickname": "This is a character who is primarily, or even only, known by their In-Series Nickname.\nRelated to Everyone Calls Him \"Barkeep\", but that is about people being referred to exclusively by their jobs or what they're best known for doing.

Also doesn't include people who give themselves new names following an act of self-reinvention, and stop responding to their old name (e.g. Voldemort). Exceptionally badass examples of this trope fall into the Red Baron. Obvious and common contractions, i.e. someone's full name being William but introducing themselves as Bill, don't really count either.\nUsually, Dramatis Personae will give the full name of such a character first, though the actual script will use the nickname almost exclusively even in the unspoken directions.\nIf the character insists on the nickname, it's Do Not Call Me \"Paul\". If the nickname is actually his real name, it's His Name Really Is \"Barkeep\".\n"}
{"SecondSuperIdentity": "This is when your hero decides that, for whatever reason, they are going to create an additional superhero alter ego besides the one they already have. This is often, but not always, due to necessity or due to a superhero mid-life crisis. This new identity is often less well known than their original one. Maybe it's to do things that their alter ego can't be seen doing. Maybe they dress up as another preexisting hero to cash in on their reputation. Sometimes it's just a stylistic name change. Or sometimes their alter ego is being hunted by cops and they need to crimefight while getting their name cleared.

{"TheChainsofCommanding": "Authority means a lot of things: Sure, when everything's going well, everyone has to listen to what you're saying; you don't need to do the stupid parts of whatever your group is doing; you're probably less poor than your underlings; and you get to look fine in your boss garb.\nBut, when things don't go quite as well \u2014 which can easily be a permanent state \u2014 it results in one side effect above all else: stress (which also happens to be loaded with side effects). That is, if you actually care about the people you're leading.\nHigh-ranking characters can be full of angst. They feel lonely, because strict protocol has to be observed \u2014 they want to beware of showing bias to friends and family, after all \u2014 and because no one acts natural around them. They have to make the Sadistic Choice and can't always Take a Third Option; they may need to make plans that allow for their friends dying. If they overlook something and can't adjust to it in time, they may get their people killed and feel that It's All My Fault, and end up with incredible guilt. For every failure they have to be willing to be held accountable publicly when others are looking for someone to blame. They worry about the neighbors invading, about marrying for strategy, about breeding an heir, about the natural disaster that destroyed half the crop, about that backstabbing relative of theirs eying the throne on which they sit. The worst part is that they shouldn't even complain aloud and should reject any sympathy, as that would leave them looking weak. Not that that notion is always obeyed.\nThis can be the consequence of Be Careful What You Wish For. If they crack under the stress and are usurped as leader, they'll frequently cry \"I'm Still the Leader!\" The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask and some Wise Princes are royals who suffer a lot from this trope. Sometimes the reason for Prince and Pauper, if the ruler decides to escape and leave a double to bear the burden.\nNot to be confused with the chain I beat you with till you understand who's in ruttin' command here, nor is it the same as the Chain of Command, which was renamed to Slave Collar (and is completely unrelated).\nSee also Being God Is Hard for the chains of being in charge of all Creation.\n"}

{"ThePaolo": "This is the love interest's love interest; the person brought in, either for an episode or an arc, to date the one that the main character (or just a character) is in love with. The smitten character will be jealous, take an instant dislike to him (often being blind to what attractions he does have), and do whatever they can to sabotage the budding relationship. Usually, the character is either an alpha-dog Jerkass or a bland, boring milquetoast. They may also be the character's Always Someone Better or The Ace to really inspire the Green-Eyed Monster to take hold.\nThis is a hard character to successfully pull off, probably because they usually start out more as a plot device than a character. In many cases they exist solely to create tension and keep the lovers apart, so there's a real risk that your Romantic False Lead, rather than proving a worthy rival to the main character's romantic interests, will simply end up being a rather flat, boring character who just seems to show up and occupy space between the two romantic leads. As a result, this can often risk the show falling into a Romantic Plot Tumor. Furthermore, except in rare cases the False Lead is unlikely to generate the same loyalty or sympathy as the main character, meaning that your audience is liable to just spend the time the False Lead's around loudly wishing for him or her to just go away (and possibly die) already so the two characters they're interested in seeing together can actually get together.\nCharacterisation can also be tricky. If the false lead is too likable, then the jealous character will seem like a selfish jerk who cares more about winning their beloved for themselves than seeing them happy \u2014 or alternatively, since 'perfect' tends to equal 'uninteresting' in the minds of many when it comes to fictional characters, a too perfect and nice character will just lose the audience's interest in comparison to the more flawed and interesting main character. On the other hand, if he's too unlikeable, we'll wonder what the love interest could possibly see in them and lose respect for them.\nWhen introduced for a short arc, often exists expressly for the purpose of contrasting their relationship with the Official Couple's, in order to show how perfect the \"official couple\" is for each other.\nSometimes to up the angst, the writer will go so far as to marry the love interest to the false lead. If this happens, expect the Official Couple to have a tawdry affair.\nOccasionally, the writers step in themselves to engage in Cleaning Up Romantic Loose Ends. This is usually another trap in and of itself, as it is difficult to do so and not seem cheap, as happens with Derailing Love Interests.\nA subtrope is Disposable Fianc\u00e9.\nCompare Hopeless Suitor, Romantic Runner-Up, New Old Flame, False Soulmate and Wrong Guy First. Also compare Temporary Love Interest where the relationship is unsuccessful because there is no Official Couple and that won't change. Often the focus of Die for Our Ship.\n"}
{"YouCannotFightFate": "A prophecy that tells the future, or in Time Travel, something that is known to have happened in the past comes true despite all attempts to prevent it. (Often it happens because of those attempts).\nThis can involve a Prophecy Twist on the language used in the prophecy. It's as old as Oedipus Rex, used by Shakespeare and Tolkien, and still fresh at least as recently as the mid-80s sitcom!\nDepending on the mood of the series, the final fulfillment of the prophecy may or may not be a Downer Ending. Sometimes, the heroes still manage to put right the wrong the prophecy promises. In such situations, they usually conclude that fate only said something bad would happen, not that they couldn't eventually right it. An Aesop usually follows about free will being stronger than destiny.\nOne technical term for the Time Travel version of this trope is the predestination paradox, a concept very popular with the Ancient Greeks, who believed You Cannot Change The Future. There is only one possible future, and if you think otherwise, it's because you were destined to take a different path.\nSometimes this can turn out to be odd in certain Freaky Friday type Time Travel stories. There can be a gazillion outcomes for everyone...except the one thing that the Time Traveller wants to change (saving one particular loved one, hometown, etc.) So everyone else in the cast may have good or bad results in different Alternate Timelines; but Fate is saving all of its energy to prevent a positive outcome for just one person, because Fate don't take kindly to having its hand forced.\nNote that this is the exact inverse of the common Western portrayal of fate as an outside force of some sort, acting to \"guide\" outcomes in real time as they progress \u2014 both of these opposite notions fall under the concept of \"You Can't Fight Fate\".\nIf the prophecy comes true because of being made (in the most common scenario, because of everyone's attempts to prevent it), it's a case of a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy. If the universe appears to self-correct any attempt at change, then Ontological Inertia is in play. In any case, on the Sliding Scale of Free Will vs. Fate, stories where You Can't Fight Fate register as Type 1 on the scale.\nSince it's Older Than Dirt, most examples rely on a Prophecy Twist. If time travel is involved, You Already Changed the Past.

{"BaitandSwitchBoss": "A Bait-and-Switch Boss is those times when the apparent boss for the stage gets replaced by the real boss, who then steps up to the plate to challenge you. The primary version has the boss destroy the 'bait' boss before he even attacks, but some games may have you fight the lesser boss for a bit before the real boss takes his place.\nThe real boss could be a Giant Space Flea from Nowhere. It could also be The Man Behind the Man, but it isn't a requirement that the real boss is in any way the real leader or in greater authority, aside from his presumed rank. If the new boss is a familiar face, then the story just got Hijacked by Ganon. If the bait boss isn't killed upon being replaced, you might end up fighting them for real later on.\nIf you actually have to finish the first boss off yourself, then go against another, it's a Trick Boss.\nCompare The Worf Effect; Always a Bigger Fish.\n"}
{"PerkyFemaleMinion": "A good way of applying the humor of The Comically Serious to villains is by pairing them with the Perky Female Minion. This character is something like the Distaff Counterpart/Foil to the Enigmatic Minion; she can range in psyche from Punch-Clock Villain to fairly psychotic, but have an upbeat, Genki Girl personality, in sharp contrast to the (usually male) Big Bad she serves, who will be gloomy, Ax-Crazy, etc. If the female minion has a crush on her boss, which she often does, it will generally be of the Mad Love variety, although this affection isn't a requirement, nor is its reciprocation.\nHowever, despite her cheerfulness and energy, she is usually still good at what she does. When this is the case, her employer usually views her as a Bunny-Ears Lawyer.\nCompare Savvy Guy, Energetic Girl for a similar dynamic. Contrasts The Baroness for the exact opposite, a chilly/chilling and sadistic villainess. Can be a subtrope of Vile Villain, Laughable Lackey.\n"}
{"Brainwashing": "One, some, or all of the main characters have been brainwashed into happily slaving away for someone else and have to get their memories back to escape, usually assisted by someone who remembers who they were (The Power of Love often playing a part).\nThe most fun, delayed variety of brainwashing is the innocuous Manchurian Agent. If they are attacking people, it's a case of Brainwashed and Crazy. And look out for that one character in a million who's Not Brainwashed. Or in truly horrific settings, keep an eye on the ones Conditioned to Accept Horror. Compare with \"Body Snatching\". Occasionally done via television. May require deprogramming to cure (see also Meat Puppet).\nNaturally, there is Power Perversion Potential to be found in this. See also Kiss Me, I'm Virtual. Often done to the Weak-Willed. If the heroes do it, it's likely Brainwashing for the Greater Good. Watch out for Intrinsic Vows.\nOften the brainwashing victim will come to his/her senses and resist, necessitating the villain to pour on the mind control mojo. Sometimes they will perform the hated task, but weep openly as they do so. This is not far off, as hypnosis cannot force someone to do something they intrinsically believe is wrong. Occasionally, even when the character does overcome it, they don't clean off all symptoms, and all isn't instantly right with the world because of it. Can be the cause of a Face\u2013Monster Turn.\n"}
{"SpellMyNamewithanS": "This trope describes characters whose names are almost never spelled consistently, usually because of transliteration issues. This tends to happen in Anime and Japanese video games that haven't been officially translated into English, although it also crops up in other languages that don't use the Latin alphabet. Situations include anything from drama between vowel additions to unique-cipher dropping, due to phoneme sets and writing systems. English, for example, is famous for many ways and rules of spelling (e.g., Americans generally dropping extra vowels such as in the word color, as compared with its British spelling colour), despite having far fewer actual sounds they represent. Japanese has separate vowel-heavy syllabic and ideographic writing systems; since the latter overlaps with Chinese, sometimes there is a question of whether a name should be transliterated from the Japanese or the Chinese reading. Spanish has several familiar looking letter combinations intended to be pronounced in specific ways. Complicating the issue is that some names simply become popular enough in other languages that they're modified to fit them better, and you can't be sure if it's actually intended to be meaningful. Another complication is when the name is only ever shown in modified form, meaning we simply have to guess.\nAssuming an official release settles the issue, some fans deliberately use one of the alternate spellings to establish their \"credibility\" as fans. In true fan fashion, this often persists even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, such as Theme Naming, Meaningful Names, Prophetic Names, and direct proclamations by the work's creator. Eventually, this stops being cool and just starts making people angry, and the self-righteous morons hit the Fandom Berserk Button.\nIn some cases, official translated versions will adopt bizarre transliterations for the sake of Writing Around Trademarks and/or establishing new ones\u2014because, when a Cash Cow Franchise gets imported, it's more useful to have character names that can be trademarked for the sake of selling licensed merchandise.\nThis trope is omnipresent with Greek. The convention in English is not to transliterate, but instead to Latinize, Greek nouns and names. Hence nigh unpronounceable Latinizations like \"Cynoscephalae\" instead of \"Kynoskefali\" for Greek \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u1f78\u03c2\u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b7, \"dog's head\".\nThis can also occur in translations of ancient texts written in outdated forms of modern scripts. For example, early Latin had no \"J\", but, as English has no consonantal \"I\", \"J\" is often used to signify such (notwithstanding that Y is actually the closest equivalent to a consonantal I in English). To a lesser extent, this can occur when transliterating words that contain a thorn (\u00fe), which is already well represented by \"TH\". In point of fact, it can even be seen in many English texts from before standardized spelling (yes, there was such a time), won ecksampel beeing \u00feis frais. And ano\u00fere beeing \u00feis sentans. \u00deis won heer is a partickularlie gud ecksampel.\nThe trope's name comes from an Isaac Asimov short story, \"Spell My Name With An S\", in which a pair of Sufficiently Advanced Aliens use The Little Shop That Wasn't There Yesterday to stop The End of the World as We Know It\u2014by persuading an obscure scientist to change one letter of his name from Z to S, and watching Hilarity Ensue (until they realize that The Watcher will know that there was supposed to be an Earth-Shattering Kaboom, and so are forced to come up with an equally subtle Reset Button). Asimov was inspired to write the story after having his name misspelled\u2014Azimov, or even Asenion once\u2014one time too many. Incidentally, Isaac Asimov's original name in the Cyrillic alphabet was \"\u0418\u0441\u0430\u0430\u043a \u041e\u0437\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\" (Isaak Ozimov, with the initial \"I\" pronounced like \"ee\") and pronounced quite differently from how the American public and he himself pronounced it during his lifetime. Now in Russia, translations of his works use the spelling of \"\u0410\u0439\u0437\u0435\u043a \u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\" Aizek Azimov) to better convey the American English phonetics, out of respect for the author.\nWhile it may apply to some folders this trope shows up on, this page MAY NOT include minor differences in romanization systems, such as the various methods of indicating long vowels in Japanese, or the use of the apostrophe to indicate syllabic nasals. VERY FEW EXAMPLES WILL BE MENTIONED AS THERE ARE TOO MANY TO LIST.\nContrast My Nayme Is, which is the intentional misspelling of one's name.\nThe opposite of No Pronunciation Guide, which is when the spelling/writing of the name is unequivocal but people can't agree on how it's supposed to sound. The tlopes can ovelrap, howevel, if a celtain sound does not exist in a a palticural ranguage.\nMay lead to a Who Names Their Kid \"Dude\"?.\nRelated to Adaptation Dye-Job (and/or other Adaptation Tropes, as the case may be). Compare with Rouge Angles of Satin, when a word or name is spelled incorrectly in a way that it is confused with another existent word.\n"}
{"DarkisNotEvil": "So, you have a race of people who all have black, leathery wings. They're born with the ability to shoot black, shadowy globs out of their hands. Also, they prefer the night, and let's not get started on their wardrobes. Surely, they're evil!\nWell...no one actually mentioned them doing bad things; in fact, they may actually be pretty good guys. It's not like they keep pet dogs exclusively for kicking. Despite any images that may have been burned into our minds, creepy appearances and killing people actually don't have much to do with each other. Unfortunately, however, people can still judge them based on their looks. Expect some Van Helsing Hate Crimes.\nThis trope can be a subversion or aversion of several other tropes depending on how it's played, including Beauty Equals Goodness, Always Chaotic Evil, and Colour-Coded for Your Convenience. A common use for it is for the \"Don't judge a book by its cover\" Aesop. It can also be used to promote Evil Is Cool and Evil Is Sexy, and sometimes Even Evil Has Standards, except without the, uh... evil. Even though with the subtle (or not so) undertone of Humans Are Bastards that this trope implies, using this does not automatically enforce Light Is Not Good; in fact, stories where Light Is Good and Dark Is Not Evil are quite common.\nThe extreme form of this is The Sacred Darkness, where Dark is not just not Evil, but is in fact equally holy and Good as Light (or even more so) is typically perceived to be. In situations where The Sacred Darkness exists, however, Dark Is Not Evil is not an absolute certainty, and the usual caveats about Light Is Not Good still apply.\nLight Is Not Good, Good Powers, Bad People are sister tropes. For the inverse, see Dark Is Evil. A natural implication of the Yin-Yang Bomb. See also Good All Along, Bad Powers, Good People, Creepy Good, Face of a Thug, Terror Hero, Perky Goth, Our Monsters Are Different, Anti-Antichrist, Reluctant Monster, Good Is Not Nice, and Halloweentown. When vampires are involved, this trope generally puts them on the friendly end of the Sliding Scale of Vampire Friendliness, often resulting in a Friendly Neighbourhood Vampire. Gods of the underworld and death in particular can be this, since Everybody Hates Hades.\nContrast Evil Wears Black.\n"}
{"Bioaugmentation": "The biological counterpart to Cyborging: instead of altering humans to add machine parts, the geeks in the lab-coats change the flesh, blood and DNA.\nGenetic Engineering and stem cell research opens new avenues in the way science and Sci-Fi writers can create modified humans to suit any environment. You could think of them as artificially created Mutants, but \"artificially created\" is the key to the definition. And we mean created on purpose, not by freak accident like being bombarded with gamma radiation or other exposure to Green Rocks.\nOn the mild end, this can entail things that, if current medical science keeps trending the way it does in Real Life, may not sound all that fantastic in a few decades: limb grafts, biological prosthetics and less visible gene mod enhancements that make people smarter, stronger and better at stuff. Further down the fantastic scale you start to get genetic superpowers, quick and easy drastic cosmetic changes from plastic surgery on up (want green skin and spots? No problem!), extra limbs and stuff that makes humans look a lot more like aliens than most Human Aliens.\nCan be combined with Cyborging for even more body mod fun. Certain types of Functional Magic may accomplish the same thing but many or most of them are better listed under Mix And Match Creature or Hybrid Monster, and of those remaining, should be looked at with Clarke's Third Law in mind. Is a newer trope than cyborging because Genetic Engineering Is the New Nuke (and shares some but not all examples with it). Also see Organic Technology, LEGO Genetics, Magic Genetics, Superpowerful Genetics, Mix-and-Match Critters, Art Major Biology, Designer Babies, Bio Punk, and its Super Trope, Transhuman. Can overlap with the Stock Superpower of Biomanipulation.\n"}
{"VillainOfTheWeek": "Episodes where the characters fight a villain and the whole story is wrapped up at the end, never to be dealt with again. Can be seen as the complete antithesis of a Story Arc, or as a Big Bad arc compressed into one episode. Sometimes, use of a plot element like Arc Words can bring together what appear to be unrelated threats, but other times they are established as being minions of the ultimate Big Bad from the start.\nThe term (a play on Movie of the Week) was originally coined by the writing staff of The Outer Limits (1963), which sought to distinguish itself from its biggest competitor, The Twilight Zone, by promising viewers a new monster every episode. Out of its 49 episodes, only around 8 twisted or outright eschewed the formula.note\u00a0\"The Man Who Was Never Born\" (where the \"monster\" is the protagonist), \"The Hundred Days of the Dragon\", \"The Borderland\", \"Controlled Experiment\" (where the central characters are two martians with completely human appearances and a time control device on hand, and they aren't evil), both parts of \"The Inheritors\", \"The Form of Things Unknown\", and \"Demon with a Glass Hand\".\nVariations crop up from time to time, though the most generic term is \"Villain of the Week\". The 4400 and Smallville, for example, are sometimes discussed in terms of the \"Freak of the Week\". Mystery of the Week is the detective series version of this trope.\nSometimes, the monsters get ridiculous, especially in fillers, where they are almost always themed after the plot of the episode. Futari wa Pretty Cure had a giant vacuum cleaner early in its run, for example; Digimon Adventure, a walking garbage dump.\nThis actually is not a bad thing. Monster of the Week (and perhaps Monster Munch) can be used to establish characters or setting. Or perhaps lead to a much bigger Story Arc.\nSubtrope of One-Shot Character. Often used in collaboration with Adventure Towns, may or may not be Monogender Monsters. See also Ro Beast, Monster of the Aesop, and Single Specimen Species. Contrast Monster Mash, Rogues Gallery and Villain Exclusivity Clause.\nNot to be confused with Shaenon Garrity's The X-Files parody webcomic Monster of the Week, or with the Apocalypse World style Tabletop Game of the same name.\n"}
{"OdeToIntoxication": "The vocalist sings about how great it is to get drunk, high, or stoned \u2014 often, but not always, with biting sarcasm (and even if it's intended ironically, that doesn't mean the fans will take it that way.)\nWhen the tongue-in-cheek version is used well, it can double as a less Anvilicious way of saying Drugs Are Bad, becoming Type 1 of the Ode to Sobriety. Compare Drunken Song, when the singer is currently drunk \u2014 which can certainly overlap with this trope.\nSee also But Liquor Is Quicker, Drugs Are Good, Love Is a Drug and What Do You Mean, It Wasn't Made on Drugs?.\n"}
{"BadassLesbian": "With the fading tradition of portraying gay people as effeminate, weak or perverted, and with some people using the word \"gay\" as if it meant \"incompetent\" or \"stupid\", it still requires some skill to successfully make a character badass while at the same time have the character directly or indirectly engage in same-sex romance. If done well, the contrast between the negative stereotypes and the awesomeness of the character can enhance the character(s) and/or the plot.\nThe stereotype of gay people as effeminate and weak is almost exclusively used toward gay men. So to counter that stereotype, badass gay male characters are often Manly Gay or Gayngster. But that is not always the case with all\u2014enter Agent Peacock. Lesbians have the opposite problem since they often fall into the Lesbian Cop, Lesbian Jock, or Butch Lesbian stereotype in media. In their case, being badass isn't so much the problem as much as making the character more well-rounded.\nNote that gay romance or a gay/bi identity is enough for this trope\u2014it doesn't have to be both.\nThe audience can be expected to regard a romance between two individuals of different genders as simply a romance, yet regarding a romance between two individuals of the same gender as a gay romance rather than just a romance. However, unless the work is about homophobia, don't expect the characters to encounter any homophobes raining on their parade. Except maybe a stray Straw Loser or two who likely ends up getting their ass kicked by the Badass Gay character. However, don't be surprised if they get suspiciously similarly discriminated against for some unrelated and maybe unearthly reason. Author Appeal or Author Tract may be involved.\nMay overlap with Manly Gay, Agent Peacock and Gayngster.\n"}
{"WiseOldTurtle": "Turtles are often fairly long-lived animals, especially compared to other creatures their size. The common tortoise, a species native to the Mediterranean area and often kept as a pet, is fully capable of outliving its human owners. Giant tortoises, such as those native to the Galapagos and Seychelles islands, are the longest-living land vertebrates of all: Galapagos giant tortoises often live to a century in the wild, and one specimen lived for one hundred and seventy years in captivity, while Seychelles giant tortoises are thought to reach around two centuries of age \u2014 their tendency to outlive human observers has made their exact lifespan difficult to verify.\nThe result is that tortoises and turtles have obtained well-earned reputations as immensely long-lived animals, something that often carries over to their portrayals in popular culture. Turtle characters are often very old, much older than other characters they interact with. The association of old age with wisdom and life experience is carried over and naturally brought to extremes \u2014 since they're so old, these ancient reptiles can be expected to have seen and done a great many things over their long, long lives, and to have had time to accumulate extensive troves of wisdom and insights to share with younger and more inexperienced characters. In worlds of Funny Animals, Talking Animals, Civilized Animals and the like, tortoises tend to be cast as various iterations of the Mentor Archetype. Depending on the individual experiences and disposition the aged chelonian in question, they may be a Cynical Mentor, an Eccentric Mentor, an Old Master or any other subtrope, but regardless of the type turtles and tortoises are some of the likeliest animals to be cast as wise, old mentor figures.\nThis can extend to turtle-themed characters, even if they are not actual turtles themselves.\nSee also Sturdy and Steady Turtles, Turtle Island, and Turtle Power for other common portrayals of turtles and tortoises in fiction. See Lovable Lizard for another reptile commonly portrayed in a positive light.\n"}
{"PuttingTheMedicInComedic": "The world of medicine isn't really the best place to have a giggle at, mostly because it's a profession full of serious business in which the fate of a patient's well-being is in the hands of surgeons and doctors, but sometimes, it's okay to laugh at something that seems terrifying so that there's not much to worry about. Maybe that really tall, attractive and intimidating nurse that's taking your temperature has a sense of humour!\nThis is simply a comedy about the medical profession, whether it's about the staff in a hospital or a doctor's office, or the antics of the patients. It's not always doom and gloom after having your appendix removed \u2014 your bedside neighbor could be misdiagnosed with anaesthetics that makes them act a little loopy, or Doctor Jerk has suddenly gained a softer side for a dare, or you have front-row entertainment to the ongoing drama between your doctor and their failed attempts of flirting with another member of staff.\n"}
{"Defictionalised": "The complete inverse of Product Placement, Defictionalization is the transformation of a product or object from a movie, book or other fictional source into a real item in the real world. Almost always done as a merchandising tie-in that helps promote the source, and provides an additional revenue stream to boot.\nThis can become strange if the product becomes highly recognized. A viewer who doesn't know about the defictionalization may see its appearance in the original source as blatant product placement, or even as a straight documentary.\nA Sub-Trope of Life Imitates Art. Related to The Red Stapler which is when fiction (further) popularizes an already existing thing. Differs from Fake-Real Turn in that the fictional element was never (mis)represented as real. Is often a result of a program that is Merchandise-Driven.\nNot to be confused with Deconstruction, or with Reality Bleed or The Fourth Wall Will Not Protect You (which are story devices about the fictional world blurring with real ones). Also see Fictional Video Game.\n(Examples should be listed under the medium of the work they originally appeared in.)\n"}
{"ConstrainedWriting": "This is when an author writes in an atypical pattern. The reasons for this can vary, from Leaning on the Fourth Wall (if it's related to the story in some way), to keeping certain plot points and twists hidden to the very end (e.g. avoiding gender pronouns for a Samus Is a Girl twist; see The All-Concealing \"I\") to simply being a stylistic choice. Some types of self-imposed challenges include writing in a particular metre, or making each line a letter longer than the one that preceded it; writing in code (e.g. replacing words with ones that appear a few places afterwards in the dictionary); avoiding certain common letters (the correct term for this is a lipogram, by the way; E is the most commonly used because it's the most commonly used vowel in several languages); using words that display some sort of complex pattern (e.g. making large chunks of the story alliterative or in palindromes); drabbles (stories of precisely 100 words) and many more.\nRemember this applies to any challenge imposed on the author by themselves, so normal deadlines and schedules don't count, though improvising with limited resources or using a particularly strict time limit does (see NaNoWriMo for one example).\nThe alternative name \"Oulipo\" is from a group of French writers who were dedicated to this style of writing. The Other Wiki also has an article on the concept.\nSome authors might adopt this as a Signature Style. Unconventional Formatting can be related. When this is used within an otherwise normal piece of writing to show something specific then it is Painting the Medium. Flash Fiction is a subtrope.\n"}
{"EvenMoreOmnipotent": "Ah, The Omnipotent. The ultimate Story-Breaker Power. A Reality Warper able to do whatever they please or imagine despite physical or natural laws. A character in this class of power is nearly impossible to challenge.\nUntil they meet THIS guy.\nThis is a special type of No-Sell made especially for when two god-like beings collide. If two unique characters are \"omnipotent\", then there has to exist limits to their power. Logically speaking, two characters that can literally do anything is impossible, because just having individuality is technically a power. So in a contest of warpers, the one who will win is whoever can No-Sell the most. In such a scenario, if Omnipotent Being #1 is usually able to turn anyone to salt with just a thought, Omnipotent Being #2 is either immune, or can prevent or reverse that power with their own effort.\nSometimes, the entity in question simply encompasses a larger sphere of power: a Genius Loci, Odd Job God or Anthropomorphic Personification of a defined place will typically lose to a Cosmic Being, a Dimension Lord, a Multiversal Conqueror, or capital-G God. Being the God of Horses is fine, but it doesn't help you much against the Spirit of All Living Things.\nAt other times, each deity is a Principles Zealot and can be undone by a Logic Bomb or a bit of Rules Lawyering. In these cases, it doesn't matter how much power the opposition actually has, because the victim's own limits defeats them. These rules, or whoever imposes them, are what's Even More Omnipotent than either god.\nSo in order for this trope to be in play:\nA Sub-Trope is More Than Infinite, which is when a plot suddenly breaks an omnipotent mechanic to resolve a conflict. See My Kung Fu Is Stronger when it involves martial arts.\n"}
{"TheWhitePrince": "The Sheltered Aristocrat is a character who has lived a life sheltered from the everyday trivialities which the lower classes have to contend with. In this way he is pure and untainted by the hardships of the outside world.\nThis results in a certain naivety and ignorance, despite the numerous tutors he's no doubt had all his life. When he is finally exposed to the outside world, it becomes apparent that the character is out of his depth. He doesn't realize how difficult and dangerous life outside his palace really is, and as a result he is a Horrible Judge of Character, easily duped by conmen and stolen from by thieves. Often he thinks he can talk his way out of confrontations, or throw money at any problem, and generally doesn't recognize, at least initially, that bad things could actually happen to him out in the real world. He will often be puzzled and even intrigued by the goings on of everyday life, resulting in Mundane Object Amazement. Sometimes the irony will be taken further as the Sheltered Aristocrat proclaims himself to be an expert, having studied the lower class from textbooks, only to be proved very wrong. Often he has no idea how to do common, everyday activities and is thus rather helpless if he finds himself on his own. He may also be unaware of any suffering his people are really going through in his kingdom until he comes face to face with it.\nThese characters tend to fall into three main types: a plucky-type with child-like innocence and kindness, a silly and cowardly-type who is treated like a joke, and snobby and superior type that can be cruel. Most of the types have a good chance to mature into the honourable and melancholic Wise Prince or the practical and down-to-Earth Princely Young Man during their adventures, though the cowardly and snobbish types have just as much of a chance to turn their back on the real world and shut themselves back in their palace, if they can.\nThis trope can include any character, not just princes, who are sheltered in this way. See also Gilded Cage, Upper-Class Twit, Spoiled Brat and Spoiled Sweet. Compare Sacrificed Basic Skill for Awesome Training.\n"}
{"ArtifactofDeath": "The Artifact of Death is an item that will eventually bring about the death of anyone who owns, uses, or comes to be associated with it, often in a grisly and supernatural manner. It can take any shape, whether ancient, toy-like, or high tech. This terrible item is often foolishly sought by many for its \"power\"... which, of course, always comes with a price: the life of the user. More often than not, it just takes, rather than both giving and taking, typically because it contains a terrible Curse.\nThough it has a lot of overlap with the Artifact of Doom (especially the Evil Weapon), the Artifact of Death doesn't actually need to have a corrupting influence or magical powers, it just has to kill whoever uses it. Also, the time taken to kill whoever uses it varies. In some stories, the Artifact will kill anyone who attempts to use it on the first try. Other stories will have the owner die in a set amount of time, after a set number of uses, or it may simply shave years off a user's lifespan. It can sometimes be an Amulet of Dependency as well.\nIf an artifact is intended for the Chosen One and reserves its dangerous side effects only for other persons who try to use it, it's an instance of Only the Chosen May Wield (and/or possibly an Empathic Weapon). If it is a sacred object and/or imbued with divine supernatural powers, that's Holy Is Not Safe.\nIf the Big Bad is a walking Artifact of Death, see also Bad Boss. See also Harmful to Touch. Contrast Immortality Inducer.\nIf the artifact keeps bringing death to its wielders not by itself but at the hands of others seeking to possess it, it's an Artifact of Attraction \u2014 even if it has a property to induce unnatural desire towards it.\nAs a Death Trope, all Spoilers will be unmarked ahead. Beware.\n"}
{"MadProphet": "The good news about this guy is that he can see the future. The bad news is that it turns out that seeing the future is not good for your mental health. Perhaps it was the stress of breaking through the boundaries of time, perhaps it is the strain of seeing so much all at once, possibly including alternative futures. It could be that now he can see the future, the concepts of time and causality don't make sense any more. Maybe they can't handle seeing the truly Bad Future awaiting them. Or it could be that they are only able to see the future because they are mad, writers often don't distinguish. Either way what we have here is easily one of the most useful and irritating types of Seer. Work out what they mean and you have genuine cast iron visions, get confused or ignore it and you will find it coming back to bite you.\nThey tend to speak entirely in metaphor, riddles, vagueries, and oblique poetry.\nA partial inverse of With Great Power Comes Great Insanity, related to Go Mad from the Revelation, Poke in the Third Eye and Prescience Is Predictable. Compare The Schizophrenia Conspiracy, Infallible Babble, His Name Is....\nCompare also The Cassandra, when a character doesn't get mad from predicting the future, but still gets ignored, and sometimes considered as mad by others, because he can predict the future.\nSee also Waif Prophet, Junkie Prophet, and Fainting Seer.\n"}
{"RiseOfZitboy": "In Real Life, acne is a fairly common thing that people go through, usually when they reach a certain age. It's not uncommon to see pizzafaces left and right in the real world, and no one really makes a big deal out of acne unless it's really noticeable on someone.\nThe world of fiction, however, didn't seem to get the memo. In fiction, especially shows and movies aimed at kids and teens, any character who develops acne (usually a girl, but there are male examples too) will treat it like it's the end of the world, even if it's just one pimple.\nUsually this is used as a plot device when a female character is preparing for a date, school dance or something similar. She is bubbly and excited that she'll finally be going out with the boy of her dreams and knows in her heart that it will be the best day of her life. But then, the night before her plans, she notices in the mirror that she has a huge zit that in many cases resembles a flashing LED light (except for the \"flashing\" part, of course, unless Rule of Funny is in play), usually right in the middle of her forehead. She will then spend the remainder of her time fretting over the fact that she doesn't have perfect skin and will usually take drastic measures to hide or remove the pimple. Her attempts usually fail and the acne is eventually revealed to her peers, who treat it like some kind of hilarious mutation the likes of which they've never seen.\nOften, though, her date will tell her that it doesn't matter to him if she has perfect skin or not, saying she's beautiful just the way she is. If a female character with bad acne succeeds in having it removed, it usually reveals that she was beautiful all along.\nWith male characters, however, this is usually played completely for laughs and there is no sympathy shown to them by any of the other characters at all. There's also an urban legend that having sex will cure acne, so the implication that a guy with bad skin...\nStrangely, most shows that use this trope depict the character as only having one pimple, with the rest of their face being completely clear. If a show is known for anything supernatural (like Wizards of Waverly Place) or the protagonist has a vivid imagination (like The Amanda Show), expect the zit to become a speaking sentient creature.\nThis seems to be becoming a Discredited Trope these days, as it rarely turns up outside of parody.\n"}
{"NotNowKid": "The kind of thing useless adults will say to a Kid Hero or child who has some rather urgent news. This pint sized Cassandra will be shooed away from grownup company or harangued for being \"Just a Kid\" before even getting one word out. This isn't necessarily limited to just children either; a pretentious character can silence a friend or underling in this manner, or a grown woman when the men don't take women seriously. This can also be used as a put down to annoying characters when two more powerful/important characters are discussing something. The kid will get interrupted after the word \"but.\"\nExasperatingly, the shusher may even scold the shushee later for not speaking up! And for even more frustration, the Very Important Grown-Up Things the grown-ups would much rather do or talk about may be completely asinine.\nUsually, the very thing the child/friend/underling was trying to say turns out to be significant or important, and the hero will regret having brushed it off. In darker examples the brush-off leads the hero into greater danger by blundering directly into the situation he could've been aware of in advance; or worse, the person making the warning is put in grave danger (or killed) since he or she was asking for help.\nSee also Cassandra Truth, when the warning is heard but often sounds incredible and is subsequently dismissed until it's too late; Crying Wolf, when the warning is heard but dismissed because of the prankish messenger; and Evil-Detecting Dog, when the warning is made by an animal (and may be either recognized or dismissed). See also, Glad I Thought of It. A subtrope of Poor Communication Kills. Compare Poorly Timed Confession. If a character applies this to someone that seems like a victim (but isn't really), then it is The Victim Must Be Confused.\nContrast Kid Has a Point.\nIf the kid in question is mistakenly thought to be dead, that's the subtrope Not Now, We're Too Busy Crying over You.\n"}
{"NerdActionHero": "When a character is primarily a Nerd (or possibly Geek), but still manages to pull off feats of Action Heroism, then they are a Nerd Action Hero.\nSometimes this is the result of Character Development, where the character starts out as a Nerd but over time develops heroic skills. In other cases the character is a Hidden Badass.\nSometimes a Nerd Action Hero may be paired with an Action Girl, and aforementioned Character Development may occur as a result of their interaction.\nThere is an overlap with Badass Bookworm, but many of those are badass first and bookworm only as a bonus. There can also be an overlap with Science Hero, but a Nerd Action Hero tends to do more ordinary Action Hero things (shooting, fighting, jumping, etc.) when the action starts.\nFor characters who generally take Guile Hero or The Smart Guy roles to the point where viewers might even forget they're devastatingly effective at getting physical, they might have Minored In Ass Kicking.\n"}
{"Kappa": "Kappa is a Greek letter. But this article isn't about that kind of kappa.\nThere are thousands of Youkai in Japanese mythology... but one of them is far more popular with the public than the others. The Kappanote\u00a0meaning \"river child(ren)\" is a river-dwelling creature of Japanese folklore. It is often depicted in Anime and modern media as an anthropomorphic turtle with a domed head and a ring of spiky hairs sticking out from it.\nIn Japanese myth, the kappa is a river-dwelling spirit who likes to eat human entrails and blood. It has a deep depression in its head that is full of water, which is the source of its power. That bowl is surrounded by scraggly hair (transformed into the \"spikes\" of the modern incarnations by the Anime Hair phenomenon). Those confronted with imminent devouring by a Kappa are advised to take two courses of action: The first, and most preferable, is to give the kappa a cucumber, inscribed with one's name in some tellings. The cucumber is the Trademark Favorite Food of the kappa, and a kappa so bribed will spare the giver. It may even befriend the human for the tasty gift. The other action: Bow to the kappa. Kappa are extremely polite, and will always bow too. Bowing will cause the water to fall out of their bowl, weakening them and allowing you to escape. (Don't bother trying to fight them, as they love sumo wrestling.)\nIn modern times, kappa have undergone a bit of Disneyfication that bowdlerizes most everything except their appearance and love of cucumbers. In Japan, kappas endure a surprising popularity that leads to them popping up in a lot of Japanese works. Even those that aren't explicitly mythological like to throw in a kappa or two. While they haven't reached the same level of popularity in the West, Popcultural Osmosis and the recent popularity of anime means that Western works sometimes feature a kappa or two.\nThere are many different regional names for the kappa, and appearance varies considerably between regions as well. One particularly unusual kind of kappa is the hyosube, which is covered in hair. The third disciple of Tripitaka, Sha Gojyo, in Journey to the West is often represented as a kappa, though the actual tales depict him more as a river-dwelling oni. Despite the fact that said river, in the original Chinese version, was a river of sand.\nNot to be confused with a rather famous Twitch emoticon. Nor with the Web Comic Kappa, although it does feature anthropomorphic sea creatures, including the eponymous fish-boy.\n"}
{"ArtifactsOfDoom": "The Artifact of Doom is an unusual villain in that it is a (seemingly) inanimate object that somehow manages to be pure evil. It is the threat of corruption and falling to The Dark Side. It may also cause Great Insanity, death, or worse.\nThis item has a palpable presence beyond merely being a device. Its threat is ever constant, whether destroying those it directly opposes, or consuming those who dare use it from within with dark whispers of power. Nonetheless, it is incapable of action on its own; its power lies in manipulating its user to act for it. Therein lies the irony: if people would just leave the thing alone, it would be harmless, but since Evil Feels Good, some idiot will inevitably try it out and doom us all.\nThere will be a conflict among the heroes, between those who say they should dare to use its power and resist or purify the corrupting effects; and those feel it should be destroyed/sealed. The artifact will often make this conflict escalate to a Hate Plague with deadly consequences. This may be explicitly stated as one of its powers in the case of the Artifact of Attraction.\nStill think it's worth the risk? Think you can handle it? After all, once you realize how evil it is, all you have to do is get rid of it or destroy it... Both of which are easier said than done.\nOften has An Aesop on how power corrupts and over-reliance on technology/magic is a bad thing.\nIf the artifact is a wearable item that refuses to come off (or you will never want or think about taking it off), then it's also a Clingy MacGuffin. If it's a Dismantled MacGuffin, then reassembling it is required to get the Set Bonus.\nUsually found at half-price at The Little Shop That Wasn't There Yesterday, or handed out by the Evil Mentor (if he hasn't turned himself into the artifact). If It Was a Gift, do not trust the giver thereafter.\nSub Tropes include the Tome of Eldritch Lore, Evil Weapon, Evil Mask, and the Summoning Artifact. Occasionally doubles as an Artifact of Death. More often, it is an Amulet of Dependency. Often overlaps with Happy Fun Ball when the artifact appears to be something harmless or mundane. The Soul Jar of an evil character almost always doubles as one of these. May also be the can of Sealed Evil in a Can. See also Sentient Phlebotinum and Holy Is Not Safe when the artifact was made by the good guys but still dangerous.\nNot to be confused with the Artifact of Doom 3. Completely unrelated to The Artifact.\n"}
{"DistractedBytheSexy": "For some men, it's very easy to forget what they are doing when a gorgeous woman strolls past and lose control, doing things like walking into walls, tripping over themselves, dropping fragile objects, causing a Human Traffic Jam, etc. Mostly a comedy trope.\nIf this is induced intentionally by the woman in question when We Need a Distraction, it falls instead into Show Some Leg.\nCompare Show Some Leg, Sex Sells, Sexy Coat Flashing. Contrast, naturally, Not Distracted by the Sexy, Ignore The Fanservice, and The Power of Lust (which is when the sexy inspires rather than distracts). This may occur after a Crash Through the Harem.\nIf the viewers are the ones Distracted By The Sexy, that's Best Known for the Fanservice. If the distracted party finds himself lost in thought over the distraction, it becomes Eating the Eye Candy. If distracted by someone that their orientation wouldn't generally be attracted to, that's Stupid Sexy Flanders. If communication is attempted, it can cause Gibberish of Love. Expect Favors for the Sexy by the distracted. If a character distracts themselves by noticing their reflection in a mirror, that's Distracted by My Own Sexy. See Cuteness Proximity for the non-sexy, non-human variant. Compare also with Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful! and Girls Stare at Scenery, Boys Stare at Girls.\n"}
{"ZeeRust": "Something \u2014 a character design, a building, anything \u2014 used to be someone's idea of futuristic. Nowadays though, it ironically has a quaint sort of datedness to it more reminiscent of the era the work came from (or imitates, in case the zeerust is deliberate). Also sometimes called \"Retro Futuristic.\" Think of mobile phones as a simple example \u2014 once it was considered that they would only ever be available to the rich, and they'd never get any smaller than a brick plugged into a suitcase. Now they are available to one and all and the preference has shifted from them getting smaller to thin enough to slide into the back pocket of your jeans - they'd be smaller still but you have to put your finger-tips somewhere.\nSometimes the dated feeling is due to the blatant extrapolation of trends ascendant when the work was written into the far future. Sometimes the datedness is a bit more subtle. It's possible that the prediction turned out to be technologically or aesthetically accurate (or at least on the right track), but the prediction still fails because of the designer's implicit assumption that social values will be the same in the future as in their own time (as demonstrated in the page image).\nOften the datedness behind zeerusty designs lies in the attempt of the designers to get an advantage over the technology of their time, only to find out that more mundane designs are actually far more efficient if advanced engineering and craftsmanship are used on them. Not that this is not always a bad thing: Often the dated vision of the future is a lot more imaginative than anything being attempted today, with more modern, \"realistic\" depictions striking viewers as bland and boring precisely because of the authenticity.\nGets its name and definition from The Meaning of Liff by Douglas Adams & John Lloyd, a book of neologisms concocted by the two. Not to be confused with the South African town of the same name (Adams and Lloyd mostly used actual place names for their words).\nSometimes Zeerust is present in Retraux form. May lead to Zeerust Canon over time.\nCompare The Aesthetics of Technology, Crystal Spires and Togas, I Want My Jet Pack, Hollywood History, Punk Punk, Steam Never Dies, Schizo Tech, Science Marches On, 20 Minutes into the Future, Raygun Gothic, and Retro Universe. Contrast with New Weird. When the creators actually predict what the future holds correctly, then it's Life Imitates Art.\n"}
{"TheJailbaitWait": "When an adult expectantly waits for the day a minor will reach the age of consent and be fair game for legal sexual conquest. A key component in any good Wife Husbandry plan.\nIn Real Life, the age of consent varies from place to place, but in fiction it is almost always 18, largely due to SoCalization.note\u00a0 As mentioned on that page, California's consent law \u2013 18 with no exceptions \u2013 is the strictest in the United States (and possibly the industrialized world). Most US states set consent at 16, and many of the others that set it at 17 or 18 allow for some flexibility. As Eric Burns-White puts it, referring to the subject of the page image, \"California: Not As Liberal As You Think.\" For example, the above quote from How I Met Your Mother has it wrong; that series is based in New York, where the age of consent is 17. note\u00a0Some jurisdictions, including the United States at the federal level, make it expressly illegal to cross state lines to skirt age of consent laws. The act is usually considered a form of sex tourism.\nSome countries and states have close-in-age exemptions sometimes referred to as the Romeo and Juliet laws, which protect teenage couples from rape charges even if one partner is slightly older than the age of consent, thus eliminating the need for this trope. That said, some places (such as Canada) also raise the age of consent beyond what is typical in the event that one partner is in a position of power over the other, thus justifying it again.\nSee also Ephebophile, someone who doesn't necessarily wait for legal age.\nSometimes goes in the opposite direction with a Precocious Crush.\n"}
{"CleanDubName": "When the name of a character from a show is slightly tweaked when the show is dubbed or otherwise translated into a foreign language because the original name would sound obscene.\nSubtrope of Dub Name Change and illegitimate sister trope to Spell My Name with an \"S\". See also Cross-Cultural Kerfluffle and Bite the Wax Tadpole.\n"}
{"UniversalAdaptorCast": "You have a set of characters. They work well as an ensemble; so well, in fact, that they can be slotted into just about any scenario you care to imagine, within the constraints of genre. So you can see them, identical but for different trappings (this character was wielding a sword, now it's a blaster pistol...), in places as diverse as Feudal Japan, the Modern Era, Space Opera, etc., etc., etc.\nWhat you have is a Universal-Adaptor Cast: an ensemble is cast into an odd situation and yet fits in perfectly because their roles and characters are so well-defined. They have the same personalities and the same relationships, but play out the conventions of that genre regardless of how bizarre it would be for them normally.\nThis is one of the essential justifications for Transplanted Character Fic, including the High School A.U.. The Magnificent Seven Samurai is a specific subtrope of this. Many Moe and Merchandise-Driven works are created with this trope in mind. Separate Scene Storytelling is often done this way. Commedia dell'Arte, the former Trope Namer, is a whole subgenre of theatre based upon the concept. Such a franchise is likely to have Negative Continuity, as, with a few exceptions, it's rather difficult to explain why the characters keep changing settings, roles, and time periods from story to story.\n"}
{"StarDerailingRole": "The latest blockbuster complete with an A-List star has just hit the theaters nationwide. They've done the usual talk show circuit hyping the film. The studio's marketing department spared no expense advertising it. Then the numbers come in...\n...and the film has completely and totally bombed.\nAs it turns out, the studio didn't allow advance screening of the film for critics, and for good reason. Very few of them are giving the movie a positive review. Word of mouth is even worse. And as they say in Hollywood, you're only as good as your last role. Perhaps the role wasn't the right fit, or maybe the person's lack of actual acting skill has finally caught up to them. Regardless, the star's time on the A-List (or possibly even the B-List) has come to an end. If they're lucky, they may find another Star-Making Role, but more often than not, the fallen star gets trapped in a permanent Never Live It Down and ends up fading into obscurity, never to reclaim the glory they once had. Tabloid fodder could also cause the adoring media to turn against them, often dismissing their latest project out of hand. If they have an out-of-control private life it makes it worse for the actors in question. This can also be subverted if the actors are Critic-Proof and/or have a Controversy-Proof Image.\nCompare with Creator Killer for those behind the camera, and Role-Ending Misdemeanor for when it happens due to off-camera foibles. Can sometimes coincide with Franchise Killer or even Genre-Killer in the most extreme circumstances. Contrast with Star-Making Role and Career Resurrection.\nA good number of these examples have been Vindicated by Cable or garnered Cult Classic status.\nLive-Action TV\n"}
{"MysteryFiction": "Also known as a \"mystery story\" or simply a \"mystery\", Mystery Fiction is a genre where the plot revolves around a mysterious happening that acts as the Driving Question.\nIn a standard mystery, the explanation for the mystery is gradually revealed by the investigative process of the protagonists. This is accomplished through a mixture of intelligence, ingenuity, the logical interpretation of evidence, and sometimes sheer luck. Many mysteries use a Mystery Arc as the basis of their narrative structure, though variations on the theme can frequently be found.\nDetective Fiction is a type of Mystery Fiction that focuses on a detective solving a crime, and the term is often treated as synonymous with Mystery Fiction.\nBasic Classes of Mystery\nFor a brief history of Mystery Fiction, see the Trivia page\n"}
{"BioTech": "If a society in Science Fiction isn't either following Technology Levels or magic, then you can rest assured that they're making use of organic technology.\nCars, planes, phones, computers, buildings, space ships, weapons (including artillery and war vehicles) and everything else required for a proper Sci-Fi story will be provided in the form of something that is warm, moist, skooshy and drips goo everywhere. Often, this will go so far as to include a convenient thought-based interface. Manipulation of organic matter may be part of the technology as a whole, or even what enabled the tech in the first place. Advanced nanotechnology will often be depicted in a similar fashion.\nThis type of tech is a common feature of sea-dwelling sapients. Not only are cities entirely made out of cool-looking coral, it's a technological evolutionary path that does not start with the step \"set something on fire\" or \"throw wheels on it.\" Nor would excessive humidity cause important stuff to short out.\nCivilizations who use this technology are also frequently users of Sufficiently Advanced Bamboo Technology. Depending on the aesthetic choices of the depiction, the organic technology may seem Ambiguously Robotic as well. If the organic technology is a staple of the setting or theme, compare Bio Punk.\nOften crosses over with LEGO Genetics and is depicted as a Sculpted Physique. See Living Ship for one specific example. Compare Bio-Augmentation, which could be Organic Technology applied to the human body in new and fun ways. Contrast Mechanical Lifeforms, which are organisms that happen to be mechanical in nature. Often creates the Womb Level in games. A Hive Caste System is based on using naturally evolved biology rather than technology made from biology. Applied to agriculture, the end result of this trope is often a Multipurpose Monocultured Crop.\nThis is becoming an actual thing. Interestingly, Real Life synthetic biology seems to be going the reverse direction of this trope: making biology look more like chemistry and nanotechnology, rather than making technology more like biology. Whether we'll get our meaty jetpacks remains to be seen.\n"}
{"CannotHaveSexEver": "Alice and Bob are in love. However, thanks to a curse, Curse Escape Clause, Applied Phlebotinum, Clingy Costume, Man of Steel, Woman of Kleenex, or some other reason, they can't consummate their love. Often only the sex act between the cursed character and the one they love is forbidden\u2014they could probably boink anyone else if they wanted\u2014though it's not uncommon for the cursed character to be forbidden from having sex with anyone without dire consequences. Contrast No Sex Allowed, where nobody at all is allowed to get down and dirty.\nBob and Alice may or may not still try to see each other, sex be damned, but as a general rule this leads to the end of the relationship. This is a guaranteed source of Unresolved Sexual Tension that can never end, not to mention Celibate Hero.\nSome couples will try to break the curse, find a cure for the disease or try to otherwise circumvent whatever is keeping them from consummating the relationship, but due to Rule of Drama, Finagle's Law and Status Quo Is God, Failure Is the Only Option in many such cases. However, there are also many cases of the trope being ultimately subverted.\nThis happens a lot to Horny Devils. See also Nature Adores a Virgin and Courtly Love. Often leads to But I Would Really Enjoy It.\nContrast with Asexuality \u2014 \"Doesn't Want Sex, Ever\" \u2014 and Vow of Celibacy \u2014 \"Is Prohibited from Having Sex, Ever.\"\n"}
{"PrematureEncapsulation": "Sometimes when a show is trying to come up with a title for an episode, they have to take short-cuts, such as Rule of Funny, settling for one of the Stock Episode Titles, or just generally using an old pop-culture reference to create some sort of pun. This trope is what happens when a show, usually a Long Runner, ends up later coming up with a High Concept that actually works much better with the earlier title of a previous episode.\nThis is very common in shows that use, or gradually adapt to, a World of Weirdness setting. While in the earlier episode the title may have been a metaphor for what was actually going on, say, \"Shoot the Moon\" being about a character trying to win a game via Springtime for Hitler, the later episode will involve the characters actually building a ray gun and trying to shoot the Moon with it.\nUse of this trope is almost always accidental, and as is such, it functions mainly as an oddity while the viewers wonder why, in retrospect, the writers used the naming conventions they did.\nThose curious about inner wiki working like renames will find that a lot of them are motivated by this trope. A well-meaning troper will name a trope after an abstract concept, and several months later there will be inaccurate Pot Holes everywhere assuming that the trope means something completely different. This is a large part of the reason why wiki policy encourages new tropes to have more easily understood names.\nFan Fiction\n Film - Live Action\nLive-Action Television\nTV Tropes\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"RecapEpisode": "Note:If you're seeking TV Tropes Recaps, go here.\nA type of Clip Show. An episode that sums up a season or storyline by showing clips of significant events - essentially, a Previously On that lasts for a whole episode. Often used to help new viewers get acquainted with the storyline. This is important in Japan, where reruns of a series are a rarity. It can also be used to emphasize a Story Arc as setup to the next arc.\nRecap episodes can also be used to fill out episode orders if the show's creators don't have quite enough material\u2014a common occurrence if shows prove popular enough after their first few episodes that additional episodes are ordered beyond the series's original plan (as with Super Dimension Fortress Macross). Sometimes recap episodes are created by licensees when a show is localized from one market to another; material cut for being too risqu\u00e9 for local audiences (or, more rarely, too risqu\u00e9 for broadcast in its original market after production, as with the infamous Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Hot Springs Episode) has to be replaced by something, and all the footage from previous episodes is readily available to edit in. And sometimes the two cases are combined, as when Harmony Gold created a Recap Episode of out of thin air so Robotech would reach 85 episodes.\nLonger-running anime shows will sometimes have a recap episode, usually about halfway through the series, often combined with or immediately followed by a Beach Episode in order to use Fanservice to keep the viewers coming back. However, in one- or two-cour showsnote\u00a0which can run from 12 to 26 episodes, a Recap Episode is much less likely to happen, since there's less time available to spend to catch up the audience, and they're far less likely to forget something they saw just a few episodes ago anyways.\nSometimes, combined with a Framing Device that justifies the episode in-character.\nIn today's age of Digital Distribution, recap episodes are becoming somewhat less tolerated, since the internet ensures that, even if one cannot immediately access the older episodes as needed (whether legally or not), they can easily find online discussions to catch themselves up. This is doubly so since virtually all shows will eventually come out on DVD or Blu-ray, with all the episodes right there for the audience to recap themselves (if it's even needed, as they could also just watch the whole thing in one sitting). If a single-season show has a recap episode, it may be a sign that things are not going smoothly behind the scenes.\nIn general, common in older and/or longer-running Anime, back before digital video or widespread availability of the internet existed, although in the US reality shows also do it. Becoming more popular in the West, with shows such as Lost and Desperate Housewives employing it, but in general it's much more common to show a brief recap of all relevant storylines at the start of each episode. Webcomics will rarely use this, and usually only to recap their experiences at conventions.\n"}
{"Retgone": "A character seems to vanish off the face of the earth. Sometimes people just disappear, but this is something more. People who should know about it aren't even sure who the person was. Photos look the same, but without them in. Their Love Interests either don't exist at all, or are in love with someone else. They never existed. They're not just gone, they're Ret Gone.\nOf course, it's hard to write stories about people who don't exist, so there is normally at least one person who remembers the disappeared character's life. Mostly, this will be someone close to the character, such as a friend or family member (and it's often just one person) who will do their best to find evidence, while convincing themselves and others that they're not crazy.\nSometimes, without this character, the world is a notably different place, but sometimes, hardly anything has changed at all.\nOccasionally, it'll be the character themselves, whose continued existence is the only evidence they've ever been alive. They may be Invisible to Normals, seeing what the world is like without them. Or they may be alive and well, just really, really annoyed. Cases like this can sometimes cause a Loss of Identity if the character fears that they will start to forget themselves.\nCommon methods of a Ret Gone include killing them off at youth, shunting them into an Alternate History, and removing them from a metaphysical book of history, or rewriting the book itself in-story, although there are plenty of other Applied Phlebotinum tricks. If we actually see the character vanish and become Ret Gone, then that character doubles as a Ripple Effect Indicator.\nNamed, of course, after the Retcon.\nWhen some shadowy but non-supernatural force erases the evidence of someone's existence in a more mundane manner, they've been Un-Personed. When the writers decide to simply \"forget\" a character's existence, that's Chuck Cunningham Syndrome, when a Delayed Ripple Effect is used as a story device this will often be used to perform a sort of half-hearted Story Reset which may inadvertently 'remove' some characters from creation. When a character actively does this on a large scale, it may be to retcon the universe into being more In Their Own Image.\nKeep in mind that doing this to Hitler never works.\nAs this is a Death Trope, expect spoilers.\n"}
{"ChangingTheUncomfortableSubject": "Some characters feel a current line of discussion is really inappropriate, and they make it clear they should move on to something else. Sometimes they say \"moving on\" or \"I'd rather not talk about it\", or just leap into another topic.\nReasons the current subject isn't working can vary. It may be too Squicky for the character's comfort, Too Soon, or even something like a Metaphorgotten line.\nThere's a hand gesture that shows up frequently in anime and manga that means basically this.\nCompare Stunned Silence and Shutting Up Now. Contrast Digging Yourself Deeper (trying to talk your way out of an uncomfortable subject, and utterly failing).\n"}
{"MelodramaticPause": "A Soap Opera staple, the melodramatic pause is the perfect way to pad out time, show everyone's up-close reaction to a provocative statement, build tension after same, discovering an affair, and otherwise give the actors and orchestra a chance to ham it up. Basically, it's the swiss army knife of Soap Opera cuts for scenes and episodes. This is the Drama Queen big sister of the Dramatic Pause.\nThe set up varies but will usually go like this:\nThis continues through all of the characters present, and if this is a comedy, some irrelevant characters will be eating or doing something terribly mood breaking.\nThe noise between Jump Cuts is usually a heartbeat, thump, clang, or in Spanish soaps, a musical flourish. Frequently used in episodes where there's Four Lines, All Waiting.\nWhen used in text, this generally represented by... ELLIPSIS!\nA Sub-Trope of Melodrama.\n"}
{"GrimDark": "A Tone Shift that seeks to make a work of fiction more serious, cynical or gritty.\nIn theory, this means that archetypes which we are accustomed to see acting in a more noble setting will have to act in one where they must think and act grimly in order to make progress, thus forcing re-examination of the tropes involved, or the use of new tropes and expansion of the setting, utilizing different sorts of characters and stories. In practice, however, writers can be too lazy to realize all that potential and end up randomly \"spicing up\" a work with gratuitous gore, cursing, and sex to make it more \"adult\" \u2014 often overdoing it in the process. This is not to be confused with Tough Love.\nWhen done right, Darker and Edgier works are a case of Tropes Are Not Bad. When a show uses this trope as a tagline, you can expect a mixture of: awful things happening to the characters, twisted backstories giving them a reason to angst, good and bad becoming less obvious, and the setting becoming much bleaker. However, this all works IF it's done right.\nAs one could predict, this is fairly easy to screw up and poor use of these tropes may just result in Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy if the setting gets too depressing or Narm if the edginess becomes just silly. This doesn't make it a bad trope though\u2014 when this is used subtly such as in the Harry Potter series it can create the effect of a series growing up with its audience.\nIn fact this is often the purpose of a Darker and Edgier turn. Just as a Lighter and Softer tone is typically part of an attempt to bring a fictional world to children or to younger children, a \"darker\" tone is often intended to make a setting appeal to older children or adults. But unlike its opposite, a Darker And Edgier shift is often intended not to reach a new audience, but rather to keep an existing audience as it grows up. It can also be a result of child fans growing up, Running the Asylum as Promoted Fanboys, and continuing to think of the setting as something aimed at themselves and their peers instead of the original target age group.\nThis trope became extremely popular in Comic Books as a rebellion against the Silver Age but also led to more than a decade of clumsy attempts to show that comics are \"not kid stuff anymore.\" See the Bronze Age, the Dark Age, and '90s Anti-Hero for more details about how this worked.\nThe excessive version is often known as \"Grimdark\" (one word), derived from the tagline of Warhammer 40,000. (\"In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.\") Sometimes justified with the phrase \"Silly Rabbit, Idealism Is for Kids!\". Usually shows up in Dark Fic. If a pre-existing show undergoes a Retool under the guise of making things Darker And Edgier, expect Jumping the Shark, especially if there was Executive Meddling involved. The United Federation of Charles wrote an essay called, What is Grimdark? which explains some of the history of the subject. \"Grimderp\" has in many parts of the Net become popular as a term for Grimdark that goes so far that it becomes Narm. When a specific character rather than the work as a whole is perceived as having become excessively Darker And Edgier, a popular term is \"Edgelord\". Which also gets applied to fanfic writers who produce exclusively Grimdark (or especially Grimderp) works. Future writers beware! Using this trope without knowing when to stop is a quick road to Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy.\nAs with Lighter and Softer, this practice tends to go better if the change was planned in advance to keep the tone from shifting too abruptly.\nNote that this is not the same as a Deconstruction. A Deconstruction plays out the genre's conventions to their logical conclusions in order to criticize the initial genre conventions. This does not have to be dark (see for instance Deconstructive Parody) and it doesn't prevent things from turning out well. Darker And Edgier just adds \"dark\" elements to try and get the same effect. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but often a Deconstruction can cause a work to seem darker because it's calling attention to dark aspects already implied but previously glossed over; see also Ascended Fridge Horror.\nOpposite of Lighter and Softer, Younger and Hipper, Denser and Wackier and Revisiting the Roots. Often found alongside Bloodier and Gorier, Hotter and Sexier, Obligatory Swearing, Sequel Logo in Ruins, and Real Is Brown. Often a by-product of the franchise growing bigger and more epic.\nCompare Grimmification and Fractured Fairy Tale for when this is done with fairy tales and American Kirby Is Hardcore for when this is done with boxart. See also Sugar Apocalypse, and Cerebus Syndrome. For when it applies to a single episode, see Unexpectedly Dark Episode.\n"}
{"RecurringLocation": "A place which is not the main hub or boss area in a series, but a minor place which appears over and over again within the same series.\nLike Recurring Riff, but a place. Different from Nostalgia Level in that it is merely a recycled locale rather than a place meant to invoke memories.\n"}
{"FauxEmpoweringEntity": "\n\n\nBob thinks he has someone really special helping him. A guardian angel, a fairy godmother, the president of the United States, a wise alien, something like that. This fake or imaginary benefactor (Faux Empowering Entity) gives Bob (Faux Empowered Person) something that makes him feel special and chosen. Consequentially, Bob may consider his own actions justified based on having the benefactor's blessing (or acting as per her advice or direct order).\nUnfortunately for Bob, he is totally wrong. And the results are likely to be disastrous, as Bob builds his life on a lie and maybe drags others into the mess.\nFor this trope to be played straight, it has to be revealed (to the audience) that Bob's benefactor is not legitimate.\nCompare and Contrast Windmill Political: While a windmill is a threat that isn't really a threat, this trope features a kind of help that ultimately isn't helpful. See also Scam Religion, for when Bob tries to get others to believe in his nonsense. The Magic Feather can be the token of Bob's specialness, a gift from his benefactor that symbolizes Bob's not so real powers. For the real thing, contrast Enigmatic Empowering Entity in general as well as specific characters such as Santa Claus or The Chooser of The One. Also see The Corrupter, where the character being tempted is unsure themselves of their benefactor, but is attracted to doing what it asks, nonetheless.\n"}
{"DiscreditedMeme": "Any meme that has fallen out of favor with pop culture, or at least the segment it was popular in. Either the meme was simply forgotten over time, it was one of many Advertising Campaigns that got discontinued, it was associated with something that fell victim to changing politics, it was a Catch-Phrase that got repeated too much, it was associated to the plot of a work that got outdated by new releases, or something else.\nOne of the better ways for this to come about is from a meme finally coming full circle by reaching its source (e.g. Chuck Norris himself dropping his personal favorite memetic \"Chuck Norris Fact\" in The Expendables 2, or Rick Astley popping out of a parade float and Rickrolling an entire country), at which point there's really nowhere else to go with the meme and it can be safely retired.\nNote this is not about whether the meme was any good or not. Most appealed to enough people in the first place to become memes. It's just that some aren't looked on too fondly after the fact. Until and unless the Nostalgia Filter kicks in, some of these memes are forgotten or even hated. A meme appearing on any of the old media is generally considered its dying breath, at least to the internet-at-large.\nNow the internet allows memes to propagate faster than ever, but then get discredited faster than ever, usually thanks to the repetition reason.\nThis can also use Hypocritical Humor, with someone complaining about a meme, but in the form of the meme.\nCompare Discredited Trope, Dead Horse Trope, Deader Than Disco, Never Heard That One Before, Totally Radical, \"Seinfeld\" Is Unfunny, Popularity Polynomial, Forced Meme, Defied Trope.\nContrast Clich\u00e9 (what some memes settle into).\nSince nearly every meme gets discredited to at least some degree over time, In-Universe and Creator-Acknowledged Examples Only.\n"}
{"MarathonBoss": "Some bosses can be taken out pretty fast. Not these. For these, well, you'd best make sure your schedule is clear for the day.\nA boss fight which requires a significant amount of time to defeat. Can be related to Sequential Boss, as while one part of the boss isn't long, all the parts together are. Or it may simply be an extreme case of a Damage-Sponge Boss. God help you if it's both. Has a good chance of happening with Final and Bonus Bosses. See the Marathon Level for the level version of this, which may well have a Marathon Boss at the end.\nThese bosses frequently elicit cries of \"Why Won't You Die?!\" among players (especially if there is no indication of how much health it has left). Executed poorly, it's a Goddamned Boss with possible Padded Sumo Gameplay. Executed well, it's an epic and awesome boss that will keep your blood pumping. Contrast with Rush Boss, this trope's inverse. If you were looking for a Boss Marathon, that's a Boss Bonanza.\n"}
{"HungryMenace": "They commit acts of evil. They kill and torture. Why? Not for fun, not for profit, not because they hold a grudge against their victims. Instead, their very existence and survival depends on it. Maybe they actually need to eat some specific food like vampires, maybe they feed on your pain, maybe some supernatural curse demands human sacrifices from them in exchange for sparing their life.\nThis, similar to introducing Always Chaotic Evil people, is an easy way to create conflict that can only be resolved with violence, as you can't negotiate with someone or something who needs to kill you to survive. A Hungry Menace may be portrayed in different ways \u2014 from the horrible abomination that must be slain for the good of everyone to a Non-Malicious Monster or even a natural part of the universe that is not evil at all.\nIf such a being kills and tortures to extend his life beyond its natural span, it's Immortality Immorality. It is close, but different as it present not doing amoral things and dying as the natural and only good solution for this problem, while this trope is more ambiguous. See also; Horror Hunger, One-Track-Minded Hunger, Face\u2013Monster Turn and Phlebotinum Muncher. For a typical hero response, see Guilt-Free Extermination War.\n"}
{"LootDrama": "Many MMORPGs have monsters that are infrequent spawns with rare items. In fact, the rarity of items is where much of the replay value comes into play. If all one had to do was just go to a shop NPC to buy every item, people would quit once they got bored of said items.\nBut sometimes, an item is so rare, so irreplaceable, and so iconic that it causes otherwise rational people to do horrible things. Indeed, with the uncertainty of getting it and the high competition both within and without a guild, many people resort to downright Machiavellian tactics. People will backstab, undermine, and do nasty things to try to secure it for themselves. People will abuse game mechanics, leading to excessive use of cheat programs. People will try to Player Kill those that pose a threat to them getting it. Indeed, very few guilds can have this item in their treasure pool without all hell breaking loose. Expect Ninja Looting, loot sniping, and a ton of arguments about who deserved it.\nThere are a couple criteria for an item to fall under this trope. First, it has to be extremely rare. At best, maybe two can drop per month total for an entire server. It has to be something that is the best for a particular class/playstyle, going well above and beyond other options. If you can't define a player based on whether or not they have it, it most likely doesn't count. It has to be something that drops from a world spawn, leading to heavy competition from other groups. And finally, it has to cause a ton of drama. Typically, the negative actions that players partake in to get this item will overrule any positive benefit the item gives. While the other rules can be stretched, this is required.\nSometimes, this is intended as part of the game experience (where it is often referred to as loot tension); suffice it to say, this is generally considered bad game design.\nCompare Artifact of Doom and McGuffin, fictional plot devices that share many similar properties. See also Apple of Discord, when the Loot Drama plagues a previously cohesive guild or relatively peaceful player base.\n"}
{"MonsterAdventurers": "Life is tough for a wandering monster. Not only do you have to live in a dungeon with no new energy entering the ecosystem, but you're in constant danger of being killed by treasure hunters or perhaps other monsters. Can't be a fun existence.\nBut wait! The adventurers are in an environment just as dangerous, and they live a lot longer! They get all those nifty healing potions and shiny swords and glamorous quests! Their goodness feels good! People respect them... well, usually! They're at the top of the world! Well, to the thinking monster, a course of action suggests itself...\nThis trope is not for Mons, Pet Monstrosities, or Monster Allies. This is when a lone adventurer, an entire party, or at the very least a core party member are of a 'monsternote\u00a0\"Monster\" here meaning \"normally Always Chaotic Evil in this verse\".' species. By definition either a Reluctant Monster or a Defector from Decadence, a Monster Adventurer might also be a Horrifying Hero depending on how monstrous they are. The civilian version is a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire.\nNote that this trope only applies when there's an Always Chaotic Evil (or Always Neutral Hungry) morality for the Monster Adventurers to break free from, otherwise they're just normal adventurers of an unusual species. The Monster Adventurer's natural habitat is the RPG-Mechanics Verse, though they're also frequently found in settings with Loads and Loads of Races. See also Breakout Mook Character, My Species Doth Protest Too Much, Perspective Flip and Player Character.\n"}
{"FinalExamFinale": "When a work's finale serves as an encapsulated version of all the events that came before it. They may appear in a different context this time, but somehow or other, every single part of the succession of continuity nods moves the finale's story along in a way that's very much like a Plot Tailored to the Party. This can manifest itself in the form of Gondor Calls for Aid and the Combined Energy Attack during a Grand Finale, but it's not uncommon in shows that have a lower key setting than epic battles.\nThis one may have originated in Fairy Tales. The equivalent video game tropes are All the Worlds Are a Stage and Final-Exam Boss.\n"}
{"OurPhlebotinumChild": "You want two of your characters to have a child, but going through a normal pregnancy isn't an option. If the story is Speculative Fiction, the universe's Phlebotinum may be sensitive to the Power of Love or able to generate a new life form by using some kind of contribution from two different people, thus bringing their Phlebotinum child into existence.\nOften, the couple can get their child in a much shorter timespan, it can age much faster, or be born mostly grown. As an extra bonus, the child's nature can explain Plot-Relevant Age-Up, Absurdly Youthful Mother, Supernaturally Young Parent, the female variant of Luke, You Are My Father and Homosexual Reproduction. It can also bypass one of the obvious side effects of Can't Have Sex, Ever.\nAn essential element of this trope is that the Phlebotinum child wouldn't have existed without something from each of its parents combining. The nature of what got combined can include anything that is not the natural conception means of the parents' species.\nIf more than two people are involved in the child's conception, this trope can be the supernatural counterpart to Extra Parent Conception. Pregnancy will be either absent from the child's generation process or shorter than what would be normal for the mother. In the absence of pregnancy, the parents may have Doorstop Baby-like scenario with the child before finding out the truth. In the latter case, the child may or may not have been generated in a Uterine Replicator or something similar.\nThese children tend to have a death rate much higher than that of naturally-born children for reasons including Fantastic Racism, being a Living MacGuffin, unable to exist for very long in the first place, or some dangerous form of Sentient Phlebotinum. This makes them a choice character to use in a Parents for a Day scenario. If they live, they will often become an important plot element.\nSpecific cases can fall into:\nNot to be confused with Bizarre Alien Reproduction, where the reproduction means is strange from a human point of view but normal for fictional beings. Compare Convenient Miscarriage that is the closest non-Speculative Fiction seems to be able to get if the child dies.\nBeware of unmarked spoilers.\n"}
{"ForcedMarriage": "The villain's Evil Plan isn't always to take over the world, or to kill the hero. Their goal may be far more personal and sinister \u2013 he's going to force the heroine to marry him.\nThis is often a G-rated version of Rape as Drama \u2014 in fact, the whole concept usually carries at least an implicit threat of rape when you think about it. (This can be a common source of Fridge Horror for adults looking back on the many, many beloved works aimed at children that use the trope.) It's an intensely personal threat to the heroine, one that plays up her femininity and vulnerability, especially since the marriage is assumed to be permanent and irreversible. If the heroine has a heroic male Love Interest, as she usually does, it serves as a threat to his masculinity as well. It also provides a convenient excuse for scenes where the villain puts the heroine in compromising positions. And it can lead into all sorts of Wedding Tropes \u2014 Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace is almost mandatory.\nOften, the villain is motivated by twisted affection or at least lust, but it can also just be about getting legal access to her money and property, or to her title. On the other hand, he might just be the kind of sick bastard who enjoys the idea of keeping someone trapped in a legally binding relationship that they find repulsive for the rest of their life. Or maybe the heroine herself is pretty much irrelevant, and it's really just about claiming ultimate victory over the hero by stealing his woman.\nIf the villain does this by kidnapping his desired bride, it's a subtrope of I Have You Now, My Pretty; when combined with Villainous Crush, it's also Abduction Is Love. If he threatens someone else and offers to relent if the heroine agrees to marry him, that's the G-rated variant of the Scarpia Ultimatum. In cultures with Arranged Marriage, he might convince the heroine's parents or guardians to force her into marriage. Evil Sorcerers will use their powers to Hypnotize the Princess. The villain might even attempt to trick the heroine into unwittingly doing something that counts as a legally binding wedding. (The Shotgun Wedding, where a third party forces the couple to marry, is only an example of this trope if one of them planned the whole thing.)\nFemale antagonists who use this trope are much less common than male examples, and are usually portrayed a bit differently. They're almost always motivated by a Villainous Crush (since Villainesses Want Heroes), and may even verge on being a really unstable Abhorrent Admirer rather than an outright villain; for some reason, female Gold Diggers are more likely to rely on seduction rather than coercion. Their male victims are also much more likely to foil the villainess's plan on their own, while female victims almost always have to be rescued by their male love interests.\nThere is even a trope for the special Big Damn Heroes moment when it prevents this kind of marriage: Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace.\nNot to be confused with Shotgun Wedding or The Baby Trap.\nRelated tropes: Villainous Crush; I Have You Now, My Pretty; Disposable Woman; Damsel in Distress; Hypnotize the Princess; Mad Love; Abhorrent Admirer; Abduction Is Love; Save the Princess. Often Truth in Television \u2014 in fact this one's a very old real-world practice \u2014 but it's way more depressing in Real Life.\nFor in-depth information on the subject, see the article on That Other Wiki.\n"}
{"TinyTyrannicalGirl": "She's small. Short. Petite. Vertically challenged.\nShe tells everyone what to do, and expects them to obey. Threats ensue if people don't. Sometimes even physical violence. Maybe she's Compensating for Something?\nPerhaps it's the incongruity of a small young girl ordering people around as if she were the big alpha male, but it's a pretty common character design. Some people think she's cute. Others think she's annoying. Either way this is a visually and verbally striking character, and is rarely forgotten. Making large men the target of her orders just adds to the fun.\nOften justified by having her be a spoiled rich kid, or even royalty. Other times, she's just the only daughter in a family full of males, and her older brothers spoil her immensely. At others, she's a mostly normal girl but either has a serious lack of social skills or is scared of being steamrolled by taller/older/etc. people, so she covers up her insecurities with an aggressive behavior. Usually she's pre-puberty age, but sometimes it can creep up into the teen years. It's possible for her to have character development and learn either humility or wisdom, but other times she'll never learn.\nCertainly some Truth in Television, as plenty of parents and grandparents can confess to being amused by their daughter ordering them about in a very decisive manner.\nCompare The Napoleon and Bratty Half-Pint. A gender-bent version could also be Tiny Schoolboy, but there are nicer forms of the character as well. The Shana Clone archetype is a notable subtrope.\n"}
{"TinySchoolboy": "Puberty can affect a teenager in many ways, and in the case of the Tiny Schoolboy, it's not always good. Males are expected to be taller than females, so this character is rather strange.\nThese small teenage boys (particularly in high school) are the target of bullying and teasing from other students for being below-average. They probably struggle to find a girlfriend because many girls want a Tall, Dark, and Handsome boyfriend, and dread falling into the Huge Girl, Tiny Guy category.\nThis causes some of them to lash out and become aggressive, short-tempered and loud-mouthed to show everyone that they're just as good as any normal-sized guy for any normal-sized girl. Expect some of them to have a taller best friend as a human shield or as a good tool for threatening people he's rubbed the wrong way (usually for being insulted about their height), although these characters usually end up as the Dumb Muscle, meaning that this Tiny Schoolboy is probably a pariah to everyone except for the ditzy characters.\nSome versions are usually the Attention Whore and can be all mouth and no legs. In many cases, it's seen as either annoying to others or just adorkable. If their boasts turn out to be true, they become the Pint-Sized Powerhouse or just Badass Adorable. In some cases, expect these versions to befriend the Huge Schoolgirl, or be dating the Huge Schoolgirl because they're the only ones that understand each other and see the person instead of the height.\nOther versions of these characters are usually the Nice Guy who respects others and is a Friend to All Living Things. Unlike the aggressive version of their characters, these Tiny Schoolboys actually get the attention from the girls... but not for being studs. Expect these types to be constantly the target of the school bullies and the jocks that struggle to get girls.\nThe one thing that the types can relate to is that they\u2019re constantly confused with children by adults, or are too short to do certain things that other teenagers can do (expect them to be rejected from theme park rides).\nThe inverted Distaff Counterpart to Huge Schoolgirl. Not to Be Confused with Dawson Casting. A Sister Trope to Teens Are Short. Also see Pint-Sized Kid for the preteen/children idea as a whole. If they're lucky, they eventually go through the I Got Bigger trope.\n"}
{"BreakUpSong": "One thing that writers of Silly Love Songs don't like to mention is that love usually doesn't last forever. People break up all the time for reasons both good and lousy, and when someone writes a song about it, it's called a Break-Up Song. Although not as omnipresent as Silly Love Songs, if you turn on a radio station and listen for a while, there's a good chance that you'll hear a Break-Up Song or two mixed in with the endless stream of Silly Love Songs. Many times it emerges from the songwriter coming from a breakup himself.\nBreakups inspire all different kinds of emotions in people, so there's a lot of variety among Breakup Songs. Songs written from the perspective of someone who has been dumped tend to be different from songs written from the perspective of the person doing the dumping. Please sort examples by the general category they fit into.\nCompare Anti-Love Song, Grief Song, and Telephone Song. Contrast Silly Love Songs.\n"}
{"CutlassBetweentheTeeth": "Taking disregard for the old saying \"Don't run with scissors\" to a whole new level, the Cutlass Between the Teeth is the tendency for particularly badass characters to run around with the handle (or blade, if they're feeling really tough) of a sword or knife clenched between their teeth. Can have its uses\u2014at most earning a free hand\u2014but its true purpose is to make the character doing it look even cooler. One would think you'd only attempt this on something whose blade has an edge on just one side\u2026\nA frequent tactic of Pirates, who often need their hands free for swimming or climbing the rigging.\nObviously not Truth in Television. As you can imagine, biting down on a hard and thin piece of metal is not very comfortable on your teeth. Not to mention you'd have to worry about dropping the damn thing while running and jumping around in combat\u2014a hard object (tooth) holding a hard object (blade) gives a poor grip. Oh, and slicing the edges of your mouth comes to mind, too.\nCompare Now, That's Using Your Teeth!.\n"}
{"DismissedGender": "Situations where a trope involves a character of a gender different from usual, making the trope either more accepted by the audience or rationalizing why the characters don't react in the usual way. Interestingly, this is useful so fans or writers can rationalize something away that they've been taught is otherwise unfashionable to tolerate without actually changing the underlying premise.\nRelated to Always Female / Always Male (except this time it isn't). Reversing the gender of characters in a story to explore how things might be different is in Gender Flip. See also: Double Standard: Abuse, Female on Male, Double Standard: Rape, Female on Male, The Unfair Sex,and Females Are More Innocent.\nNot to be confused with Men Are the Expendable Gender or Disposable Woman.\n In General\n Series-specific Examples\n"}
{"EvilisPetty": "The tendency of \"evil\" to include not just major acts of villainy and attempts to take over/destroy the world, but also generally being an utter dick. Some examples include:\nThis is when you have a villain that slaughters a village, bombs a country, murders the president... And then he picks a pocket, trips an old lady, sticks a kick-me sign on a police officer, takes someone's parking space, and cuts in line at a fast food place.\nHe's not just evil on a large scale; he's evil on all the tiny little details of everyday life he might experience in any possible situation. This trope opposes Affably Evil and Evil Is Cool \u2014 this guy is just a colossal pain in the ass, even leaving his alignment out of the question. And often, he gets a kick out of being a pain. And it must be pointed that petty motivations do not take from the cruelty and malice of the acts, in fact they are just as likely to lead past the Moral Event Horizon and may even make the villain more hated to the audience than he would be otherwise, as there is nothing grandiose or admirable about him, he is just a scumbag of a bully. More often than not, it is a trait of a Psychopathic Manchild.\nIn video game settings with a Karma Meter, this means that being classified as Evil requires not just being uncaring towards people, but going out of your way to be nasty in any circumstances. This is an unfortunate side effect of there being an in-game benefit from reaching particular levels of evil. When maxing out your Karma Meter gives you a Stat Boost, you're strongly encouraged to do every little act of evil you can to get there as quickly as possible.\nMay overlap with Hate Sink, a character massively despised for actual villainous actions. Contrast with Poke the Poodle when all the supposed villain does is something actually harmless \u2014 they don't do anything overwhelmingly evil, but frequently behave like a mild dick to maintain their Villain Cred. See Harmless Villain for someone who lives for doing this.\nAn opposite trope is Affably Evil, in which a villain genuinely behaves in a very pleasant, friendly, and/or downright honorable manner. The Magnificent Bastard is well advised to avoid this trope; magnificence and pettiness don't mix.\nSee Also: For the Evulz, Card-Carrying Villain, The Devil Is a Loser, Even Evil Has Standards. For examples where a petty action ends up harming the villain, see Dick Dastardly Stops to Cheat, The Dog Bites Back and Stupid Evil. If the villain manages to keep his reasons secret until the climax and the protagonists act stupefied at the discovery of such a petty reason, see Disappointed by the Motive.\n"}
{"SpaceShipGirl": "Throughout history, many countries have observed the custom of always referring to ships and other seafaring vessels as \"she.\" This even applies to ships named after men (e.g., the USS Ronald Reagan). These traditions continued with the development of aircraft, and the metaphor (in fiction at least) has also been extended to space travel.\nSo, what happens when the personification is taken a step farther? You get a walking, talking female avatar of a Sapient Ship\u2014a Spaceship Girl.\nShe may be a holographic projection by the ship's computer, or she may be a physical manifestation created by Black Box technology, she may be a Wetware CPU running the ship, or she may simply turn into a human when she wants to; but she is the ship, and thus requires special handling. Spaceship girls range from the deadly serious to the outright wacky, but they are never just machines. Hint: don't make her angry when you're parsecs away from the nearest planet...Or even if you're close to a planet.\nCompare with Robot Girl and Sapient Steed. A subtrope of Sapient Ship and often a kind of Genius Loci. Related to I Call It \"Vera\" and Living Weapon. Psychologically related to Companion Cube. Might become a love interest.\n"}
{"AndThatWouldBeWrong": "A protagonist-but-not-hero character makes a casual proposition for solving a problem that is immoral, disgusting, murderous, and/or violent. A beat goes by, in which the other protagonists look at him with perplexity, disbelief, mistrust, and/or anger in their eyes. He quickly adds, \"And/But that would be wrong,\" or some other halfhearted attempt to save face.

{"Pheromones": "In real life, one of the primary means of communication between animals is scent. Pheromones may be used to attract mates, mark territorial boundaries, signal danger, or leave a trail for others to follow.\nIn some works of fiction, characters might be able to communicate by pheromones too. In many cases they are even portrayed as a means of mind control.\nSuper Trope to Smells Sexy or some versions of Love Is in the Air.\nAnime and Manga\nComic Books\nFan Works\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWebcomics\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"SimplifiedSpellcasting": "A lot of the time, Functional Magic is bound by formulas, parameters, and in-universe consistency and limitations. In a narrative context, the most common of these is having to perform a specific action to achieve a specific effect. Maybe a long chant is required to cast the spell, maybe you have to draw a circle in the ground, maybe you need to make some sort of gesture or hand sign. These are all potential openings, so you'd better hope Talking Is a Free Action.\nAnd then a character shows up that seems to, at first glance, ignore the established system by being capable of Simplified Spellcasting. They can simplify the process to produce an immediate effect with little or no Spell Construction.\nThis ability is generally the product of either years of experience, a rare talent, resourcefulness, being a Badass Abnormal, having learned the magical arts under very unusual circumstances, or being in possession of rare equipment that can assist spellcasting. In any case, expect the caster's opponent to call him out for cheating. Sometimes, however, this advantage carries a price or drawbacks inherent in the method, such as making the spell weaker than it would be with proper Spell Construction, carrying higher risks, or substituting the cost of opportunity for something else such as rare reagents or the user's own life force.\nIt can add an element of unpredictability by allowing the spell to be cast without Calling Your Attacks. It can also lead to I Am Not Left-Handed, when an opponent assumes that the caster has been neutralized because the usual methods have been suppressed.\nNote that if casting spells without any prerequisite is normal in-universe, it does not count as this trope. However, the normal requirements do not have to be completely foregone, merely reduced. Also, this is a fantasy trope. A subtrope of Thought-Controlled Power when no Spell Construction is required. Limited-Use Magical Device is a subtrope for when it's done through an item. Instant Runes is when special effects immediately do the Geometric Magic needed.\n"}
{"FantasticPrejudice": "\"Fantastic\" as in \"fantasy\" or \"fictional\", not as in \"awesome\" (i.e., not the way the Doctor uses \"fantastic\"); racism never is.\nA subset of the old trick of dealing with thorny issues through metaphor. Instead of having the hero encounter racism between, say, whites and blacks in the American Deep South, or between ethnic Czech and Roma in the Czech Republic, or between Ainu and Japanese, or any other sets of real-world groups, they encounter racism between two-headed aliens and three-headed aliens, or between people with earth-themed elemental powers and people with water-themed elemental powers, or whatever.\nNote that this can also cover other types of prejudice: anti-homosexual sentiment, religious differences, and so on. (In which case, \"Fantastic Discrimination\" or \"Fantastic Prejudice\" would be a more apt term.)\nNot to be confused with Space Jews, in which an imaginary species or culture has disturbing similarities to a real-world racist stereotype. Also related to Have You Tried Not Being a Monster?, when monsters are used as a metaphor for alternative sexual identity, rather than race. Fantastic Slurs are often involved, as are Monster Rights Movements. Real Life weaselly lines like Some of My Best Friends Are X may feature. The undesired minorities may be rounded up inside a Fantastic Ghetto, and may also be the targets of Superhuman Trafficking.\nFuturistic science fiction examples of human-on-alien Fantastic Racism will often make the human racist a member of a group historically discriminated against on Earth (such as a black character in an American-created work) both to emphasize that human-on-human racism is a thing of the past, and for the sake of irony from the viewers' perspective.\nIf the point of the story is to show the evils of racism, this trope can lead to a Broken Aesop if there are in fact good in-universe reasons to discriminate against a certain type of creature (say, because they need to eat other sapient beings in order to survive, or they genuinely are Always Chaotic Evil apart from the odd angsty heroic one).\nAlso note that Tropes Are Not Bad: most people wouldn't believe in a world where elves, dwarves, aliens, etc got along with perfect harmony, because their own experiences of different groups' interactions don't bear that out. It's called Fantastic Racism for a reason.\nIf the racism appears to be spilling into something a little less fantastic and into something more real, it's Values Dissonance.\nCompare Superior Species, in which one species actually is objectively superior in some way, Species Loyalty which may but does not need to entail this, and Master Race, when it's just in their head.\nSee also People of Hair Color, which can be another occasion for racism in fantasy, and Dehumanization, where one race is dehumanized to make them easier to kill.\n"}
{"Dialogue": "All about the things that characters say.\nSee also Language Tropes and Narrator Tropes.\n"}
{"ProWrestlingEpisode": "A Pro Wrestling Episode is just that: an episode that takes place at a Professional Wrestling match or event. It is expected for this type of episode to appear on live action pro wrestling shows or fictional works whose premise revolves around pro wrestling. This becomes more distinct on a work that does not interact with (or even mention) wrestling before the episode.\nIf the latter does occur, expect a series regular, Fake Guest Star or character who is a wrestling fan to get involved a match somehow. There is also a good chance that someone will hint, if not say outright, that wrestling is fake, unless it's real. Usually averted with Indian leg wrestling, Greco-Roman, Sumo, Ya\u011fl\u0131 G\u00fcre\u015f (Turkish oil wrestling) and Olympic/collegiate wrestling, because of those examples actually are real.\nCompare with Boxing Episode.\n"}

{"StealthClothes": "Many anime characters seem to think that in order to sneak anywhere, it is necessary to at least tie a handkerchief (known as a tenugui) around one's head, with one set of adjacent corners tied under one's nose and the other two knotted to make it into something like a skullcap. (It looks like a variation on the handkerchief-headgear of Monty Python's \"Gumbies\".) Many fans throw around theories like \"tying the handkerchief under the nose is supposed to help dampen the sound of breathing\".\nIn fact, it is derived from ancient Japanese romantic practices. Young unmarried women were not to be too friendly with young men, and home visits at night were right out! So the young man would wear a handkerchief in the aforementioned manner. That way, if the lady liked the gentleman, she could honestly say that she did not see his face clearly (and if she did not like him, he could be identified easily). Over time, the classically-tied handkerchief became comic shorthand for \"Incompetent Sneaky Person\".\nSometimes this is supplemented with a full ninja suit, but many characters think the handkerchief alone is sufficient. It usually isn't (but that probably doesn't stop it working as a Paper-Thin Disguise).\nClick here\u25ca for an example.\nA possible version in the proto-trope stage at the moment may be Solid Snake/John Rambo's long bandana.\nFor the Western equivalent, see Blatant Burglar. If you're looking for the other kind of Stealth Clothes, try Spy Catsuit.\n"}
{"AbsurdlySharpSword": "An absurdly sharp blade is a bladed weapon with Absurd Cutting Power because it's just that damn sharp. No magic, technology, superpowers, or other type of Applied Phlebotinum required to slice and dice to your heart's content. Such things may have been involved in the production of the blade, but when in use, its cutting power comes from its pure physical sharpness alone.\nBlades like these almost always result in a Clean Cut \u2014 in fact, about the only thing they can't cut is a similarly sharp weapon. Expect to hear some Audible Sharpness (Audible Gleam optional) whenever one of these blades is in use. Frequently used in Single-Stroke Battles. Be very afraid if an Absurdly Sharp Blade is in the hands of a swordsman with Implausible Fencing Powers; luckily, the Inverse Law of Sharpness and Accuracy usually ensures that it isn't.\nSharpened to a Single Atom is a subtrope popular in Science Fiction settings, where the blade is so sharp that the width of the cutting edge can be measured in atoms or molecules. See Absurdly Sharp Claws when the ASB is a Natural Weapon.\n"}

If the latter, expect a Reset Button.\nWhen a seer is really powerful, she is The Omniscient or an Omniscient Hero. However, it might turn out that she is Not So Omniscient After All.\nThis can also lead into a Fantastic Aesop about not using this power for selfish gains. It can also lead to Fridge Logic about being able to see the future but not being able to avoid and/or fix many problems. But then stories that do are often accused of having God Mode Sues. Although the latter can justify a Gambit Roulette because the chance involved in such plans is negated by their powers. These types will likely invoke All According to Plan.\nA Sub-Trope of Psychic Powers. A Sister Trope to My Significance Sense Is Tingling (a more vague feeling instead of visions).

{"VitriolicBestFriends": "When two people who are the very best of friends behave like the very worst of enemies.\nMany true friends are openly warm and affectionate with each other, keeping a united front in public and having their arguments in private. Such friendships are not this trope.\nThese guys bicker constantly. They're always sniping at each other. They snark relentlessly. They duke it out on equal terms, hurling insults at one another with prejudice, maybe ever since they were little kids. But underneath the verbal fencing is a rock-solid friendship that no Smug Snake could hope to chip at. A Friend in Need may be needed to make this manifest. Often, they have opposite morals, personalities, or fighting ability which is presumably the cause of the vitriol (or maybe it's just because they're both Deadpan Snarkers). Such characters may go for a Friends All Along fight if one is introduced before the other.\nThis trope can often serve as a warning that something may be wrong as well. When one of the Vitriolic Best Buds suddenly stops responding to insults or flinging barbs of their own, the other may pick up on the sudden change in behavior as a sign that something is not right.\nWoe betide any outsider to this unusual 'friendship' who thinks that because one is constantly snarking on the other, it gives the outsider the right to make snide comments about the other as well; usually, they will quickly (and painfully) learn that \"no one makes fun of him/her but me.\" This is more a given when the vitriol is mutual between both friends, but in the variation where only one is vitriolic it may be a Pet the Dog moment or proof that aw, look: They really do like each other!\nCompare Aww, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other, Belligerent Sexual Tension, and With Friends Like These.... Contrast with Headbutting Heroes, who just cold-out despise each other despite being the best of heroes, and Friendly Enemy, where two people who are on separate sides of a conflict aren't all that hostile to one another. Some types of Villainous Friendship have a similar dynamic. Inverted Trope of Overly Polite Pals.\nNOTE: Due to a rewrite of this page, many examples will still refer to previous \"type one and type two\" dynamics. \"Type two\" is the version of the trope described above, while \"type one\" is a variation in which only one friend is vitriolic while the other friend is completely oblivious to the vitriol and much, much friendlier.

{"TheGrandVizier": "Sometimes it's the monarch/Head of State who's the Evil Overlord. And sometimes there's this trope, where instead of the Head of State being the person who has malicious intent, it's his adviser, assistant, second-in-command, or Head of Government (that is if the Head of State and Head of Government are separate positions, such as with having both a President and a Prime Minister, respectively). Most of the time he's actively scheming to discredit or usurp the throne, and may even be an agent sent for this purpose by an outside power. In other cases, he's perfectly content to be The Man Behind the Man and keeps the ruler around primarily as the figurehead for the ignorant masses and as the fall guy if something goes wrong. He can also tend to have more actual power and real influence than the Head of State, especially in cases where the government is a parliamentary system or a constitutional monarchy.\nSometimes called the Evil (Grand) Vizier instead, in which case he will spend a lot of time tapping his fingertips together and calling everyone \"effendi\". The \"Evil High Priest\" is a closely related phenomenon, with some Sinister Minister and Corrupt Church thrown in.\nIn stories set in Presidential democratic societies, an Evil Vice President may play the same role, although it is a lot less common. In the American political system in particular, there is a fairly legitimate reason why the vice president is an illogical position to be filled by someone evil: by default, the vice president (generally) has very little actual power, unless the president is incapacitated or has delegated significant amounts of formal authority to the vice president. However, if the Vice President is planning to have the President be assassinated or the President is an easily controlled fool, this trope would easily apply.\nWhile Chancellors, Vice Presidents, and the like may not always be examples of this trope merely by having the job, the title \"Grand Vizier\" might as well just include \"Evil\" as part of it, in the eyes of English-speaking audiences, especially if the Vizier's name is some version of \"Jafar\". If you see a non-evil Grand Vizier, the author is probably playing with the trope... or you're talking about Real Life (the historical Ja'far ibn Yahya, while a Vizier, was not particularly Evil, and in general \"vizier\" is just the Persian-influenced Muslim world's word for \"[government] minister\"). The word \"Chancellor\" itself has also got a bad taste in English countries, due to one of the most famous real-life codifiers of the Evil Chancellor character.\nMalicious Slander is a particular favorite of the Evil Chancellor.\nAs cliched as this trope may seem, it is often justified in that if anybody's going to usurp the reigning ruler through manipulation and intrigue, it's going to be the guy who actually has the authority to replace him. Part of the basis of this trope may also come from the context in which stories are written; in a monarchy, it can be dangerous to tell stories about an evil king, so pushing all the blame onto an evil adviser is an easy way out. This extends into political commentary as well \u2014 it is safer to vilify an adviser for hated policies than the leader themselves.\nIf only the King thinks the evil chancellor is his most trusted and loyal subject, he's a Horrible Judge of Character and a Clueless Boss. When only the protagonists see through the evil of this character, it's a Devil in Plain Sight. If he doesn't want to steal the throne himself, then his goal is almost certainly to turn the ruler he allegedly serves into a Puppet King.\nThis trope is the Evil Counterpart of The Good Chancellor. See also: The Evil Prince, who is usually also after the throne and rather less willing to remain in the shadows. In fantasy settings, will often overlap with an Evil Sorcerer; if his \"official\" job is to be the ruler's personal magic-user, then he's also the Court Mage. In settings with a strong Asian or Middle Eastern influence, expect overlap with Eunuchs Are Evil. Aspiring backstabbers may refer to the Evil Chancellor List. If the ruler the Evil Chancellor \"serves\" is also evil, that's The Starscream.\nIn terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are The Good Chancellor, Lady Macbeth (when it's the Queen/First Lady who's doing the scheming), Standard Royal Court and Deadly Decadent Court. The next steps up are The Evil Prince, Prince Charming, Prince Charmless, Warrior Prince, Princely Young Man, The Wise Prince, and all Princess Tropes. The next step down is The Brigadier. Also see Treacherous Advisor.\nCompare Dragon with an Agenda.\n"}
{"LustfulMelt": "A fairly common staple of Western Animation, this trope involves a character being so enamoured with another, their whole body turns into a puddle of goo. Can be used as the female equivalent of Something Else Also Rises (and often is, as seen in a lot of Warner Brothers 1990s cartoons, like Animaniacs and Tiny Toon Adventures). Male characters can experience this too, but it's either used as a Censor Decoy if the censors don't want implications of erections to be shown or if the writer wants to move past metaphorically showing an erection or ejaculation and go straight to metaphorically showing an orgasm/post-coital come-down.\nA Sub-Trope of I'm Melting! and a (sometimes) Distaff Counterpart of Something Else Also Rises.\n"}
{"HairstyleMalfunction": "The Distaff Counterpart to Fake-Hair Drama\\Dodgy Toupee. From the existence of the Bald Woman trope, you know that if a woman is bald then there's obviously something not right and she'll likely try to hide this lack of hair with a wig. Whatever wig she's chosen is apparently very flimsy as it'll inevitably get ripped off, exposing her naked head to the world. She will shriek in embarrassment and try to cover it up while the person who ripped off the wig will apologise endlessly. This is always Played for Laughs and the woman will typically be just a random extra or if she's a developed character, she'll be a nasty person so this wig reveal is her getting some kind of comeuppance. The woman doesn't actually have to be bald as the wig could just be covering up a bad dye job or the woman just felt like wearing a wig for some reason. Another variation can include a girl wearing hair extensions to get them ripped out. See also Gag Haircut.\n"}
{"SorcererKing": "When a sorcerer gains enough knowledge of magic, Alchemy, Elemental Powers, or the innermost workings of magic, he may use his powers to Take Over the World. This is not that trope.\nThe Benevolent Mage Ruler is a fair and just ruler. This type of sorcerer king (or queen) will usually rule over Fantasy settings. Often in charge of one of two warring factions; his kingdom and an evil empire.\nThis sometimes overlaps with Emperor Scientist, especially where Clarke's Third Law, Alchemy Is Magic, and/or Magitek is in this setting. But this trope is different as while the Emperor Scientist focuses on the sciences (and is usually evil or Mad), this character type is more in tune with the art of magic (and is usually good). This also overlaps with The Philosopher King, The Good King, The High Queen, The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask, Princesses Rule and She Is the King.\nCompare Emperor Scientist and Magocracy, the sci-fi and Vast Bureaucracy counterparts, and Authority Equals Asskicking or Asskicking Equals Authority depending on how he became King or Queen in the first place. Contrast Sorcerous Overlord.\n"}
{"NotAsYouKnewThem": "Pushing a new character into the spotlight via Character Derailment of the character that they're replacing. Dying to Be Replaced seems merciful and dignified by comparison. At least that way you're dead, or comfortably converted to The Dark Side, before someone starts messing around with your job.\nThe \"victim\" who was Dying to Be Replaced is moved out of the way, but the victim who is Not As You Know Them is expected to stick around and suffer. Not only have they lost their old title, it's usually through circumstance rather than their own fault. Unfortunately, whatever happened to them has transformed their personality - generally into something more jaded. They're still there in the story, they're still (usually) on the side of good... but for all intents and purposes, it may as well be a different character. They often become a Cynical Mentor to the new hero, who, of course, is much better at their job than they ever were.\nIt's a trick that writers use to keep people tuned in to the show/playing the video game/reading the books when they decide to switch protagonists. Rather than risk starting all over again with a new character, the writers use the old hero as a hook to lure in the \"old faithfuls\" in the audience. Unfortunately, many fans have become wise to this ploy and view such sequels with some trepidation. It's a bit of a Catch-22 - do you avoid knowing your favorite character's fate, or find out what happened to him, at the risk of realizing that you don't particularly like what's happened to him?\nSo why do a character assassination on an old favorite? Well, if the returning character was as lovable as (s)he originally was, the viewers' familiarity with them means that audience allegiance would remain firmly on their side... even when they're going against the new hero. That's not what the writer wants \u2014 they want you to follow the new guy, so the returnee is demoralized to alienate them from the viewers/readers. However, this can backfire if the viewers resent the newcomer already, just for being a \"usurper\", and then find insult added to injury when they find their original, amiable hero has become grumpy and surly in the gap between series.\nThe quickest way to figure out if a character has become Not As You Know Them is to ask yourself \"if their physical appearance was completely different, and I wasn't told exactly who they were, would I have figured it out or assumed they were a new character?\"\nIf another character is not benefiting from this character's change in personality, it's a case of Same Character, but Different, NOT this trope.\nAs is always the case with Character Derailment tropes, Not As You Know Them can be fairly subjective; there will be those who hate the changes and declare Fanon Discontinuity, and those who like them and cite Character Development (albeit Character Development that happened \"off screen\").\n"}
{"TeamSwitzerland": "So The Hero and The Lancer are having another row again. Or The Empire and The Good Kingdom are at war again. Whatever the case, past or present; mainstream society or small group; there is nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide...\nOr is there?\nTeam Switzerland is defined like the country it takes its name from: a completely neutral ground. Traits that can be found in Team Switzerland are neutrality and logic. The members are the voices of reason that are sometimes ignored. But even when pushed to the limit by the insanity surrounding them, they know how to keep their cool. They refuse to take sides, but unlike The Starscream or Wild Card, they're not in it for selfish motivations or the ultimate redemption.\nThey are not a pendulum swinging from one team to the other. Instead, they are an immovable object that maintains solid ground and an objective opinion. Bonus points if a member from Team Switzerland tries to work a treaty between both opposing sides. Extra points if both teams refuse to listen and go along with it anyways. Sometimes, this can result in an untold cataclysm because Team Switzerland may know the base WILL Be broken. Negative points if the team refuses to choose, even if the choice is clear and beneficial - no matter what, they will not take a side.\nThe natural habitat of Team Switzerland is the Truce Zone.\n"}
{"Succubus": "There are beings who stalk the night, searching for a victim, a victim that could very easily be you. And when they find you, they won't eat you or tear you to shreds. Oh no, plenty of other monsters and demons have cornered the market on that. No, they will do something far more sinister. They will appear to you as a breathtakingly beautiful woman or handsome man.\nAnd then they will have sex with you.\nNot terrifying enough for you?\nHow about if sex was also their way of sucking out your soul/lifeforce, which will leave your body a dry husk, a literal Empty Shell?\nNowadays, these are generally referred to as incubus (always male) and succubus (always female). In actual folklore, these demons were not vampiric, had no need to feed, and were not particularly attractive, being sexual predators. The horrifying sensation of sleep paralysis, where you wake up and are unable to move, was known as incubus as late as Victorian times. (Not to be confused with the band of the same name. Or the Esperanto language horror movie.)\nHowever, modern fiction writers don't want to use them like that, so typically, the baseline rules are:\nIncubi and Succubi are almost always treated as a species or type of demons. Some stories actually make them a breed of vampires, since they function similarly (vampires feed on blood for sustenance, incubi/succubi feed on sex), but they are almost always evil. And you do not want to run in to them. No matter how hot they are and how lonely you are.\nIn some legends, Satan Himself changed shape to be both incubus and succubus. See, Old Scratch wants kids but can't produce human seed, so he becomes a succubus, receives some sperm from a guy, turns into an incubus, and passes it on to a woman. How this transmits satanic genes is a question not addressed as the theory was invented before Mendel's time, never mind Rosalind Franklin's.\nThe offspring of said demons and a human are either demonic infiltrators of humanity or basically mortals with mysterious powers. The legendary Merlin is sometimes said to be the offspring of an incubus and a nun. Incidentally, the above mythology went a long way to explaining away pregnant nuns in the Middle Ages without destroying their virtues. Better to be seen as the victims of demonic rape than participants in consensual sex, one might suppose. (Admittedly, there were periods when people took a very dim view of violating vows of celibacy, if the vower weren't powerful or well-connected.) Several cases of actual rape in politically tricky circumstances also appeared to have been dealt with this way. Even more importantly, it explained why Merlin could use magic (which was satanic contrary to God's ordernote\u00a0that is, the Christian god. Merlin's magic was that of the local heathen deities, hence aligned to their order.), but still be one of the good guys.\nThe modern viewpoint, with its much more lenient view of sexually liberated women, tend to feature a far greater number of subversions on the classic interpretation than straight examples: most, especially in anime or Japanese games, tend to be a Cute Monster Girl/Reluctant Monster.\nCompare the literal Out with a Bang and the less direct Death by Sex. See also Vagina Dentata. For when the Main Man himself takes on a more, er, feminine role, check out Hot as Hell. If you're looking for characters with horny heads...on their shoulders, you want Horned Humanoids.\n"}
{"ChewingtheScenery": "ACTING with EMPHASIS. Nearly any emotion will do here, so long as it's EXTREME!\nA common term for a scene where an actor's acting so damn hard that they're picking bits of scenery out of their teeth for days. Sometimes scenes can actually require this, but more often the actor and/or director just has the character go over the top.\nThis can include Berserk Button, Freak Out, and other exaggerated emotions.\nIt's well worth noting that this trope is one of the biggest causes of memes.\nWhile this can often be a bad thing and ruin a scene, just as often it can add to the fun, whether a work is So Bad, It's Good or genuinely good. In a Police Procedural, this will often be due to a Perp Sweating or an Exasperated Perp.\nThis is a Super Trope, which includes:\nA Sister Trope to Melodrama.\nCompare Narm, Narm Charm.\nContrast Dull Surprise (emotionless moments when emotion is called for), Dramatic Deadpan (when the dramatic punch is from how low key it's presented).\nNot to be confused with This Billboard Needs Some Salt (actually munching on the scenery), even when it looks like it is happening (that's just the camera).\n"}
{"FearDiscoverPower": "Basically the power to discover other people's fears. Often necessary for a \"What Do They Fear?\" Episode. This power can come in several forms:\nIt goes without saying that this is usually a bad guy power. If it's a power used by a Deadly Decadent Court, Omniscient Council of Vagueness or just a plain evil enough version of The Government, then it will almost always take the form of Room 101. It can, however, be used by a Terror Hero who ultimately fights for the good guys \u2014 though, naturally, these tend to be some shade of Anti-Hero.\n"}
{"HeroAcademy": "Many fictional worlds show a hero working his way to fight and stop some great evil. Sometimes they're princes or knights fighting to save a damsel in distress, maybe they're mercenaries fighting evil for a paycheck or a regular person relying strictly on his wits and luck. Either way, they were defined as heroes on their respective stories.\nBut what if being a hero alone is to be considered a job?\nHero Academy refers to a organization, or part of an organization, that trains people to develop the skills and knowledge, combat-related or otherwise, needed to be able to do heroic deeds. Unlike Superhero School, it usually trains regular people with little to no superpowers and teaches their students the skills they need rather than picking out students that already have extraordinary abilities, though they may pick out individuals that they believe show potential.\nIt is a subtrope of Extranormal Institute: one thing a Hero Academy has in common with Superhero School and Wizarding School that may separate it from Military School or Military Academy is that they function as a society as much as a training program. Compare Adventure Guild, which can be a faction that focuses more on having individuals go on quests than on tutoring students how to successfully go through them. The Evil Counterpart is the Academy of Evil.\n"}
{"TheGreatWhodini": "Any character who is not normally a magician, but is putting on a magic show, will use a stage name formed by taking their name and appending \"-ini\". Often they'll prefix \"The Great\", as well.\nObviously the inspiration for these names is Harry Houdini, who himself based his stage name on French magician Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin, or possibly Cardini. Never mind that Houdini considered himself an escape artist, not a magician, and never presented himself as having magical powers rather than exceptional dexterity.\nNot to be confused with the 1980s rap group, though they were great.\nSee also Small Reference Pools, Dr. Genericius.\n"}
{"StuckInTheirShadow": "This is when one creator or character is pushed out of the spotlight and another member of the team gets all the credit.\nDistinct from Lesser Star, where equal credit is given for unequal work. This trope is about equal work that results in unequal credit. Compare with Breakup Breakout.\nCompare Overshadowed by Awesome and Always Second Best, where the person in the spotlight really is better than the person in the shadows.\n"}
{"SortingAlgorithmOfVillainThreat": "An antagonist can be classed on three orthogonal parameters:\nThis is a method of quantifying the first one.\nYou can class various villains on tiers of the type of threat they present to the world and the heroes. The Sorting Algorithm of Evil will usually ensure that the hero's successive opponents will each be higher on the scale than the last, but, due to the SAoE's caring about effectiveness as well as scope, not always. In general, the hero will also have the same potential for destruction as his villains, but usually is slightly below them, because underdogs are more relatable. Having a wild range of villains may help avoid causing a feeling that The World Is Always Doomed because Evil Only Has to Win Once. Having a hero with a Story-Breaker Power usually upsets this dynamic, or forces a jump in villain up the scale.\nMost series that lean towards the realistic side of the scale do not venture beyond villains that are Planetary Threats, as villains that are Stellar Threats and above tends to put a lot of pressure on Willing Suspension of Disbelief. Shifting too far up the scale, especially over a short period of time, is an easy way to Jump the Shark.\nWhen talking about some villains, this is very much related to how much they can abuse the Kardashev Scale for death and maiming. Contrast with Sliding Scale of Antagonist Vileness, when you're talking about the audience's reaction to a character rather than the threat they represent, and Sliding Scale of Villain Effectiveness when talking about how well they succeed.\nSee also Super Weight, which is more about measuring characters (including villains) in terms of raw power.\n"}
{"SkyScraperMessages": "Skyscrapers are very tall and covered in windows. This makes them a useful canvas for a creative person to turn into a message an entire city (or the world) can see.\nSkyscraper Messages come from lighting specifically chosen windows in otherwise dark buildings to make recognizable images or words. The trope, of course, only occurs at night.\nA poor man's version of Rushmore Refacement or Deface of the Moon if a villain is behind it.\nThis trope is easily doable in Real Life, but limited to special occasions because it's otherwise disruptive to the people in the offices and apartments. In the movies, the trope is often assisted by computer animation; it's easier than getting the permits/paying the money to use the building, etc.\n"}
{"SaltSolution": "Sodium Chloride. One of man's greatest discoveries. Its uses are, but not limited to, as a preservative for food, a kitchen ingredient, and as a weapon against misfortune. Even in fiction, salt or saltwater is used to defeat antagonistic forces or at least to avert a disaster.\nSalt's ability to absorb water makes it a lethal compound for many organisms. It's also a good repellent against supernatural creatures, vampires in particular.\nHowever this trope is generally about salt as somehow used in the downfall of a villain, not necessarily salt used to defeat the villain directly.\nSalt is also known to make a wound more painful \u2014 the saying \"rubbing salt in the wound\" is based on that.\nSuper Trope of Salt the Earth. Overlaps with Supernatural Repellent when used to, well, repel supernatural beings.\n"}
{"ImpartialPurposeDrivenFaction": "An organization whose non-political purpose takes complete precedence over power-plays and diplomacy. Where most factions are interested in increasing their power by building alliances, the Code of Honour of these people mandates to either avoid contact with others completely or accept any help unconditionally without taking any obligations. Their neutrality is often safe-guarded by their purpose being beneficial to everyone in long-term.\nSaid neutrality often doesn't sit well with other factions' leaders, who will try to put \"nobody's\" resources to their own use (especially if its members are trained in some Secret Art). The conflict commonly arises when members of the organization are manipulated or forced into breaking their neutrality, which ultimately leads to its downfall. Such conflict may be a sign that their purpose is no longer taken seriously.\nIn Dark Fantasy, this organization often takes form of The Order whose superhumanly enhanced members defend Puny Humans from monsters. Although \"Thou Shalt Not Kill (Humans)\" may be included in the Code to enforce Pro Human Transhumanism or at least stave off Transhuman Treachery, Fantastic Racism often plays a role in the interaction between regular humans and their Not Quite Human defenders, especially if the transformation makes them half-monster/Half-Human Hybrids, gives them a Superpowered Evil Side, or infects them with The Corruption. Attempts to exploit them as a sub-human shock troops and outright Superhuman Trafficking may be common dangers.\nOdd Job Gods and their followers occasionally fall under this, as well. As does the Time Police that is more concerned with dealing with Clock Roaches or preserving the time stream than good and bad. The Ancient Order of Protectors may also fall into as they will attempt to ward off anyone who gets too close to what they're protecting, regardless of which side they're on.\n"}
{"AccentsArentHereditary": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThis trope arises when two or more members of the same family have noticeably different accents, despite living in the same household during the years that would have shaped their speech patterns. This trope only applies to cases where family members should logically speak with the same accent, such as a case of siblings who were raised by the same parents in the same environment inexplicably having different speech patterns or a child having a differing accent that doesn't logically derive from either of their parents. Situations involving Immigrant Parents are excluded, as children can and do pick up their parents' accents despite not speaking the language that created the accent or never having visited the country where the native language is spoken. Younger children also may pick up the accent prevalent in their new home rather than their parents' speech pattern, leaving them with a very different speech pattern than the family members who raised them.\nIf the trope goes entirely unexplained, it may have been an attempt to make a character more relatable to the target audience, but could be the result of an actor is Not Even Bothering with the Accent. It's also common for all accents from the same foreign country to be lumped together - if a pair of siblings in an American series are French, then it's likely that their actors will use (real or fake) French accents, but there's little guarantee that their accents will be from the same part of France.\nA sub-trope of Unexplained Accent. Compare The Kids Are American, where the adults have appropriate accents for their country of origin, but their children inexplicably have American accents.\n"}
{"SmokeBomb": "A fairly standard disappearing trick, favored by ninja, stage magicians, and Batman. Drop a clever little smoke bomb that puffs up and dissipates quickly, slip away during the distraction. A smoke cover apparently qualifies as being \"offscreen\" enough for Offscreen Teleportation, allowing a user to escape even if he or she was standing in a clear area where his/her exit would be seen at least by the viewer if not an opponent.\nStill played straight in most cases, though there are a few stock variations and subversions:\nCompare Stealth Hi/Bye, Disappearing Box. Contrast with Super Smoke. See also Trick Bomb (of which this is a Sub-Trope), Ninja Log and Escape Battle Technique. A Handful for an Eye may serve the same purpose.\n"}
{"SequelEpisode": "An episode in a series that serves as a sequel to a previous episode. Different from a Multi-Part Episode, in that there may be several episodes (if not several years) between the first episode and the one that picks up the plot again.\nTo qualify, it's not enough to simply have an object, setting, or character from one episode appear in another, otherwise any series with a Rogues Gallery would consist almost entirely of Sequel Episode. If Cop Show has the Main Characters arrest a thief and recover some stolen jewels in one episode, and a later episode has the thief break out of prison and cause some more havoc, that's just a One-Shot Character moving up to Recurring Character status. If, on the other hand, a later episode has the cops discover that the stolen jewels they recovered were actually fakes, and they have to interrogate the thief to find out where she hid the real jewels, that is a Sequel Episode; the plot resolved in an earlier episode is reopened and explored again in a new episode.\nObviously this only applies to series where standalone episodes occur somewhat regularly. If the whole show is one long Story Arc, there's not enough separating the plot of one episode from another to make labelling it a \"sequel\" meaningful. However, if a series has multiple story arcs, it is possible for a later Story Arc to be a sequel to an earlier one. A show with half arc seasons can also have these based on the stand-alones.note\u00a0Though if the sequel to a standalone starts off a story arc, that stand-alone could be an Innocuously Important Episode. Compare Myth Arc, which can be seen as a series of these in an otherwise episodic show.\nOften uses Cross-Referenced Titles. Related to Continuity Nod, Call-Back, and Plot Archaeology.\n"}
{"ThoughtBubble": "At their most basic, Speech Bubbles are floating text circles (or other shapes) that characters in Comic Books and Web Comics or other dimensionally-challenged media use to communicate.\nBut Speech Bubbles aren't only generic circles or places to put words; they're metafictional constructs that can be painted, shaped, and written different ways! Superimposed, they can indicate an interruption, and different characters can be given different shapes or colors of bubble, making keeping track of who is speaking easier, as well as how they're feeling. Some villains and monsters like to use black speech balloons and strange colored text, and mechanical voices sometimes get rectangular \"bubbles\". If any character needs a subtly menacing tone to their speech, then it can be rendered in a black speech balloon with either white or red text (the latter maybe implying more anger). Also, madness can be indicated with mangled text, and foreign languages or accents with exotic fonts.\nSee Rebus Bubble for when a Speech Bubble contains only symbols used like a rebus puzzle rather than words.\n"}
{"GlobalAirship": "Mode of transport late in the Action-Adventure and Role-Playing Game genres that allows you to travel to nearly any location on the world map fairly quickly. This is almost always something that flies. Often, it's far beyond the Technology Level of the rest of the world, having been created by the resident Mad Scientist, or taken from an ancient civilization. Not to be confused with airships found in Real Life.\nThis is usually awarded after you've visited every part of the map in the course of the plot except one, where you will face the Final Boss. It allows the player to quickly access unfinished sidequests while avoiding the tedium of Random Encounters and the maze-like terrain of the map. Airship acquisition may also open up many hours worth of sidequests.\nMay fall under Cool Airship.\nRarely does media present this trope with the logical conclusion of just letting you fly a simple airplane, possibly because they may not be cool enough.\nAn RPG trope, especially console RPGs. See also Warp Whistle, Hub Level and Magic Map.\n"}
{"SuperDickery": "For the Trope Namer website Superdickery.com, go here.\nIt's a widespread tactic in serial fiction: show a teaser portraying the normally upright hero acting in an evil and despicable manner, causing the audience to wonder what the heck's going on and then, hopefully, to read/watch/listen to the thing you're advertising.\nYou look at the cover to the newest issue of your favorite comic, and what do you see? The Super Hero, apparently killing his sidekick and Love Interest! Or, On the Next episode of your favorite prime-time TV series, the main character goes bad, selling his team out to the Big Bad and shooting the Plucky Comic Relief in the face!\nSo you read or watch the installment in question, and find out It Makes Sense in Context. The hero, or someone in the supporting cast, was a Reverse Mole, a Secret Test of Character, Not Himself, Really Not Himself, putting on a show, or had learned that if Jimmy had gotten what he wanted for Christmas, it would have resulted in the destruction of every known universe simultaneously. It is also entirely possible that it was an \"imaginary story\" or in some way All Just a Dream. And many comic books flat-out ignore elements on the cover. For television, Manipulative Editing might also splice together two unrelated scenes for the promo, and it turns out the hero was being a dick to someone who actually deserved it. And now you're down a quarter. You should have known that Covers Always Lie and you can Never Trust a Trailer, but you were pulled in... by Superdickery.\nWarning: Silver Age comics did have a tendency to induce Comedic Sociopathy in characters, alongside the strange plot devices and twists. This means that even if Superman wasn't as evil as the cover made him sound, the reader might still have to say \"what a dick!\" at the end of the story.\nDoesn't really work with Anti Heroes.\nThe reason for this trope, however, isn't the writer's intent. During the Silver Age, the covers were designed first, and the writers had to work around that cover that had been drawn without a story.\nCompare with Clickbait Gag, an In-Universe use of one of Superdickery's web equivalents, Clickbait.\n"}
{"SuperHappyFunTropeOfDoom": "Something, often a company, that is described with an adjective in the title that is entirely at odds with what it actually does. Commonly, something evil will be paired with a nice-sounding adjective. This also applies when the title's implications are opposed to what the company/organization/Evil Overlord does. Basically, when you apply a completely inappropriate adjective to something (often to make it seem better), that's this trope. Look for characters exclaiming \"Hey...this isn't happy!\" or something similar.\nThis is a Newspeak trope. There is usually a rather pointed takeaway for the audience about the people doing the naming: a society that uses vicious irony like this is never, ever nice or just misunderstood.\nFor objects of doom that masquerade as harmless objects, see Happy Fun Ball or the more prosaic Artifact of Doom.\n"}
{"WeaponOfXSlaying": "A weapon which gets extra bonuses against a specific enemy type. Sometimes they may outright kill them in one hit.\nWays this can happen:\nIt is a subtrope of Situational Sword, and a form of Situational Damage Attack. Related is Achilles' Heel, which this weapon can be.\nUnique-named weapons with this kind of property often come with Exactly What It Says on the Tin naming.\nCompare Hunter of Monsters, who is a person dedicated to slaying a specific enemy type.\n"}
{"WickedWasps": "While bees have long been viewed as a friend to humanity, people have not, historically, had many reasons to like wasps. They're highly territorial and easily roused, even by mistake, in defense of their nests. People have therefore learned to associate them with angry swarms and impending pain.\nAs a result, wasps have developed strongly negative reputations in popular culture. Non-sapient wasps will be vicious, aggressive animals or roving swarms of droning pain; sapient wasps run the gamut from simple bullies to ferocious raiders and barbarians preying upon their fellow insects \u2014 or, if large enough, preying upon people. Wasp-themed characters, whether they simply use wasp imagery or are associated with actual wasps, are rarely pleasant people either.\nOften found in the Hornet Hole. See also Unpleasant Animal Counterpart and Animal Jingoism for when villainous wasps are matched with Virtuous Bees or ants, and Bee Afraid for when the wasps (or bees) go out in force to sting and harass their victims.\nThis is not a list of all wasps in fiction. This refers specifically to wasps being portrayed as evil, villainous or monstrous.\n"}
{"BoardingSchoolofHorrors": "Not to be confused with your usual Boarding School trope, the Boarding School of Horrors is a place where your nightmares come true. There are no midnight feasts or jolly hockey sticks here. Presided over by cane-wielding Sadist Teachers, you will be beaten or locked up for the slightest misdemeanor \u2014 and that's if you're lucky. If summoned to the headmaster's office, don't expect to come out in one piece, if at all. Then there is the matter of your fellow students. At best, you'll have your head flushed down the toilet; at worst, you face years of unspeakable bullying. In a British school, you may be enslaved to the prefects thanks to the \"fagging\" system. And the Absurdly Powerful Student Council will only add to complications as they promote this form of cruelty as presumably girls or guys they like are sent to be lowly concubines within their ranks and is above the law with the Prefect acting as their muscle as they choose whom to beat up or torture.\nThe food is inedible slop, there is no central heating, and creepy-crawlies are everywhere. If you complain or write home to your parents, they won't believe you (assuming your mail even makes it out of the school, that is \u2014 it's not uncommon for such schools to actively screen their students' outgoing mail). The school might be a Military School, where you'll face the wrath of Drill Sergeant Nasty every day, and be subjected to horrific hazing rituals. In the worst cases you could be sexually abused or even murdered while staying there. And God help if the school actually is a Reform School - an institution for juvenile offenders. Such institutions are basically prisons with schoolrooms.\nHad (has?) some elements of truth in television. Boarding schools were not a Victorian innovation, but the institution was embraced as a means of counteracting the softening, emasculating influence of mothers and preparing young men for the harsh rigours of the world of business and Empire. The move to purposefully harsh institutions as a solution to parental mollycoddling took place in the context of the early-mid Victorian love of childhood and doting parenthood, which it was later feared would render the new generation of the better sort of people - i.e. the middle and upper classes - too soft to maintain Anglo supremacy. Thus, boarding schools were intended to break the attendants to prevent them from becoming 'soft' and/or homosexual.note\u00a0Good luck with that. Given the rampant molestation, BDSM and rape of younger students by older ones as well as by staff (see C.S. Lewis), many probably left these cathedrals of learning thinking they were gay, whether or not they were. More specifically they would instill discipline and self-discipline, deference to authority, strict morals, a vague sense of the Christian religion, and teamwork. This was, of course, in addition to all the usual things one expects a public school (a school open to the paying public as opposed to a private school, which was more exclusive) to do. For real life examples, see also the section in the Strawman U page for \"St. Jim Jonestown Academy.\" The overtly strict atmosphere of the boarding schools produced a proverb When a lower class kid turns bad, he is sent to a borstal; when an upper class kid turns bad, he is sent to a boarding school. Some boarding schools hardly differed from reform schools (borstals) except on curriculum.\nAlso there is some Truth in Television with the system of boarding schools set up in The United States, Canada, and Australia for the children of the native peoples, from the late 19th century and well into the second half of the 20th century. The agencies in charge of these schools forced parents to turn over their children as wards of the government and sent them, often hundreds of miles, away from their families and communities. Their clothing and ornaments were burned on arrival and their hairnote\u00a0long hair had and still has great significance for Indian people was cut short. A few of these institutions did provide a quality western-style education, or at least taught useful trades or skills, but the main purpose was to \"kill the Indian and save the man\" \u2014 forcing these children to accept that their traditional customs and languages are primitive and evil, forbidding them to speak their own languages, and enforcing the rules with cruel punishments. Children died at these schools, and they died running away. Sexual abuse was common. Once they graduated and were deemed \"civilized,\" they didn't fit in with their communities because of the mental conditioning they went through, and couldn't fit in with society at large because they were seen not as human beings, but more as tamed \"savages\" that could act \"civilized.\" Most of them ended up as menial servants. To this day, the horrors of the residential schools affect their descendants and several groups exist to help today's Native Americans from ancestral pain that has been transmitted to them.\nYou are likely to find yourself in one of these places if sent Off to Boarding School by the Card-Carrying Villain, often doubling as a Dustbin School, School for Scheming or Academy of Evil. Still, count yourself lucky; at least you're not in an Orphanage of Fear and don't have to deal with an Evil Orphanage Lady. If you're unlucky, your summer is only apt to be marginally better - but see Summer Campy for that. In the best cases, expect it to overlap with Tough Love.\nA subcategory of this is the Day School of Horrors: same sort of thing, but the kids get to go home at the end of each day; The more common types of this variant tend to be schools run by religious organizations, Catholic schools especially.\nNot to be confused with an All-Ghouls School, where the pupils and teachers are stereotypical \"horror\" entities, but are usually quite pleasant. A Sucky School is a downplayed version; it's unlikely to threaten your life, but it is going to give you a terrible experience in other ways.\n"}
{"MoreThanInfinite": "The scenario is thus: you are facing down a god-like being whose powers are impossible for you to match. They are infinite in their potential. Thus, the only way to overpower it is with something beyond that.\nThis counterattack is usually reserved for a character that is omnipotent because this is the only kind of character who could believably have 'infinite power'.\nWhen done poorly it feels like a Deus ex Machina, Ass Pull, or Only the Author Can Save Them Now.\nNot to be confused with Up to Eleven, There Is No Kill Like Overkill, or Readings Are Off the Scale. Tentatively related to My Kung Fu Is Stronger, but only applies if the being your kung fu is stronger against is an omnipotent being. See also Even More Omnipotent.\nnote\u00a0Minor footnote type thing: It should be noted that there are degrees of infinity. For instance there are strictly more points on a line (real numbers) than integers (whole numbers). However this rather abstract fact isn't usually what is meant by \"more infinite than infinite\" in fiction. Alternative number systems, studied in the field of nonstandard analysis, sometimes do include notions of values beyond infinity defined in a formal way. The ordinal numbers extend beyond infinity with the first values being 1, 2, 3, and so on. Then after all of the integers is omega which is the first infinite ordinal. Then is omega plus 1, omega plus 2, omega plus 3, and so on eventually there is omega plus omega and it is possible to continue in this way forever with values like omega squared showing up. Another, this time less formal, use of \"infinite\" is to mean \"can grow without bound\". Something like this can go on forever, eventually surpassing every finite number, but it will not technically ever reach an infinite value.\nThe Infinity +1 Sword does not (usually) work this way.\n"}
{"Toku": "\"Tokusatsu\" (\u7279\u64ae), often shortened to just \"Toku\", is the Japanese catchall term for any live-action sci-fi/fantasy media that makes use of special effectsnote\u00a0\"Tokusatsu\" is an abbreviation of coming from \"tokushu satsuei\", which literally means \"special photography\". Though the overlap is not total, it can, at least casually, be considered the live-action analogue to Anime (at least, to the subset of anime best known to casual viewers in the west).\nOriginally, Toku differentiated itself from western visual effects genres by its preference for \"live\" effects (ie. People in Rubber Suits) over special effects created during editing (at the time of the genre's birth, specifically the stop-motion techniques pioneered by Ray Harryhausen, now CGI). Modern Toku uses both forms of effect, but \"live\" effects are still preferred, particularly Wire Fu.\nTokusatsu had two major periods, dubbed the \"Monster Boom\" and the \"Henshin Boom\". The Monster Boom was started by Godzilla and famously saw the rise of many daikaiju pictures in the film industry. Henshin Boom was started by Kamen Rider, and it greatly influenced how action heroes worked and its effects can still be seen today in the superhero and action-adventure genres, with that influence even percolating westward.\nLike Anime and Manga, Toku is one of those terms that means slightly different things in Japan and the West. While Westerners use it to refer almost exclusively to the Japanese superhero shows, in Japan it simply refers to any live-action production which makes extensive use of special effects. This means that, to the Japanese, things like Smallville, Stargate SG-1, Doctor Who, Knight Rider, Red Dwarf and even James Bond count as Toku. This list also includes shows that use puppetry, like Gerry Anderson's Supermarionation series Thunderbirds and Terrahawks, and even Thomas the Tank Engine. Far and away, the most popular early example of Toku is the Godzilla film franchise, which exemplifies many of the genre's tropes: People in Rubber Suits smashing scale model cities, and an abundance of squibs.\nMost of the examples of Toku series are actually franchises of the Sentai and Henshin Hero variety, producing many separate but related series.\nToku series and franchises include:\nSuper Sentai, Metal Heroes and Kamen Rider franchises on this list were adapted, with varying degrees of success, by Saban Entertainment to produce the U.S. series Power Rangers, VR Troopers, Big Bad Beetleborgs and Masked Rider. Kamen Rider Ryuki was later adapted into Kamen Rider Dragon Knight. As for the original Japanese shows, good luck finding official releases outside of Asia....\nTokusatsu Tropes have their own page.\nSee the Useful Notes page for more information on the history of Toku and its special effects methods.\nNames To Know In Tokusatsu:\nMajor Companies producing Tokusatsu:\n"}
{"ThisIsntHeaven": "Bob dies and goes to the afterlife. At first he seems to have gone to Fluffy Cloud Heaven: it's beautiful, there's wonderful music playing, he has everything he ever wanted, etc. But then he realizes that there's one essential thing missing or wrong, and the sudden realization dawns: This Isn't Heaven! Cue the frantic screaming of a damned soul...\nOften the thing missing or wrong is something superficial, like \"no beer\" or \"eternally noisy neighbors.\" Or the thing missing might actually be the feeling of adversity itself; No Challenge Equals No Satisfaction after all, and so having every your need, wish and whim catered to instantly all the time drives you insane from boredom. Can be a form of Ironic Hell, but it's not necessary. This is specifically for actually being in hell (or thinking that that's the case), not just still being alive or something similar; see Mistaken for Afterlife.\nWhen they are actually in heaven and things are still like this, you get Hell of a Heaven.\nNot to be confused with Rerouted from Heaven, where they've actually gone to the wrong afterlife.\n"}
{"DerivativeDifferentiation": "Following the leader is ubiquitous in all media. The reasons for this vary, ranging from a desire to attain some of the success of the original work to a desire to pay homage to a work that the creator of the derivative work adores.\nThis technique can be quite a double-edged sword, however. Some fans stay away from such derivative works, either because they know that most imitations are bound to be bad or because the work is so similar that they feel no need to invest any time into experiencing more of the same, regardless of quality.\nSo creators of derivative works find ways to make later installments less derivative, either in response to fan reaction or because their storytelling skills have improved to the point that they themselves no longer have to use derivation as a crutch. The work may still have some trappings that hint at its formerly derivative nature, but it's less likely that newcomers will easily be able to discern this.\nRelated to From Clones to Genre and Growing the Beard. Has nothing to do with calculus.\n"}
{"BigFirstChoice": "Typically, games let you make choices. Some games let you make choices that have significant effects on the game world. The Big First Choice is an early player choice \u2014 sometimes occurring before proper gameplay even starts \u2014 that has a massive effect on the game.\nConsider:\nYou escape the enemy's dreadnought aboard your commandeered shuttle, with the rescued rebel leader in tow and mere seconds to spare before the explosive charges you planted crack the monstrous ship in half. Not a bad job for the tutorial level. As the adrenaline wears off, the rebel leader congratulates you for your courage and offers you a chance to work alongside her to help free the galaxy from the Dark Order's clutches. But your hero would have to give up his grand life as a space mercenary, an outlaw-for-hire: certainly he's no friend of the Order, and he's more than happy to fight them on his own time, but he chafes at taking orders from anyone.\nYou ponder the decision for a few seconds, then have your hero turn down the offer with characteristic nonchalance. You then spend the next twenty hours of this epic space opera being inadvertently dragged into one conflict after another, meeting the rebels under awkward circumstances, and generally making life hell for the Order. Finally, when all's said and done, you get to put a bullet between the eyes of the Shadow Prince, collect your reward and fly off into the sunset.\nFeeling good about your victory, you go online to discuss the game. But what's this? You don't remember an infiltration mission aboard a satellite. And a romantic subplot with the rebel leader? How come no one's talking about the MX-6000 railgun that got you through the final stages, but they're all gushing over that multi-missile launcher that the Elite Mooks had towards the end? Certainly you don't remember getting one.\nAfter skimming a few threads, you can't help but wonder: did you even play the same game as everyone else?\nThe answer: not quite. As it turned out, a lot more was riding on the rebel leader's innocuous first question than you ever could have guessed. By making one choice or the other, you determined the entire course of the rest of the game.\nNot every game is quite as extreme as this example, but the Big First Choice (or second, or third) is a common way of extending the life of a game by making the player's choices at key points have a dramatic effect on the way the game plays out - perhaps even the way the game plays, period. Multiple playthroughs are absolutely necessary to wring 100% Completion out of games that feature such choices: sometimes the different paths will converge again at the end, but it's just as likely that each individual choice will lead to a different ending.\nOne method of Story Branching. Subtrope of For Want of a Nail. Compare Multiple Game Openings, where the the story branches even before you make the first in-game choice, and Last-Second Ending Choice, where you play through most of the game before a major and irrevocable plot split. Contrast But Thou Must!, which might look like a big choice, but really isn't.\n"}
{"TheOgre": "Ogres are a staple of fantasy and fairy tales, and so appear in many forms. Most have the following traits in common:\nOgres in folklore were portrayed as child-eating monsters who sometimes had magical or otherwise supernatural powers (the ogre from \"Puss-in-Boots\" is a classic example).\nSee also Our Orcs Are Different (their names share the same linguistic root as explained above), Our Giants Are Bigger, All Trolls Are Different, Smash Mook.\nNot to be confused with trolls. Even though they can often be indistinguishable in fairy tales (when English/French tales reached Scandinavia, \"ogre\" would usually be translated as \"troll\"), trolls are generally a type of fae rather than a generic evil monster. Sometimes shares international space with oni.\n\"There ya go. Now I'm goin' back to me swamp. I'm hungry.\"\n"}
{"TalentContest": "This is a plot where the characters participate in an amateur talent contest.\nThe plot usually begins with the character need some money or something similar and the upcoming talent contest has a cash prize that suit their needs. So, they rehearse and usually create a professional level act, usually a musical number.\nThe special thing with this plot that the heroes typically never win the contest, or at least not in circumstances they were expecting. When they do lose, they take the loss gracefully, but find they have earned something far better for their efforts such as a business owner wants them to be his establishment's house band or a record label agent wants to sign them on.\nTropes that might appear during this plot include Crack Defeat, Dark Horse Victory, One Judge to Rule Them All. See also Failed Audition Plot.\nIf you're looking for a television show that is all about showing off talents, see Talent Show.\n"}
{"RebusBubble": "When you want to show the keen, obsidian-sharp mind of a character at work, or lay out their cunning and complex plans out in a Comic Book, Web Comic or similar media, the best way to do it is with a Rebus Bubble. Simply show (Person 1) + (Item/Event/Person 2) = Result. For Result, expect an Idea Bulb, Stuff Blowing Up, Hilarity Ensues, or a gravestone.\nPeople more practiced in these mental mathematics can also subtract, multiply, divide, and do other awesome algebraic equations in the Rebus Bubbles to show more complex thoughts.\nIt's not rare for a given comic to replace all text in Speech Bubbles with Rebus Bubbles for especially funny non-verbal exchanges.\nIt should be noted that this doesn't actually have very much to do with an actual rebus, which is where a word or phrase is represented by images of objects, whose names are homophones (they're a central part of the game show Concentration)... Which, in turn, should not be confused with Rebis. It should also not be confused with Speaking in Panels, which shows a story in a bubble. And certainly not with a hard-bitten Scottish policeman.\nA type of a Pictorial Speech Bubble. Exposition Diagram is often used much the same way. See Formula for the Unformulable when a character attempts to solve a non-scientific problem with maths and science. For this concept applied to tropes, see Troperithmetic.\n"}
{"AngryEyebrows": "A normally peaceful or serene character wears a serious frown after getting quite a pummeling. Or maybe a fighter stops the common trash-talking chitchat.\nIf an enemy is unlucky, the camera will focus on the character's expression changing in a significant way, indicating they're about to go all out on them or die trying. If it's accompanying a physical transformation or costume change, it pretty much indicates the enemy is about to get owned.\nNamed after the very noticeable and atypical angry contorted face on an otherwise-normal character when this occurs.\nSee also American Kirby Is Hardcore.\n"}
{"MasterOfOneMagic": "A character that's the best at what they do, and what they do is magic. Well... a type of magic, to be precise. Whether it's summoning, elemental magic, or just plain old moving stuff, they're simply the best there is.\nThey're often used as Old Masters from whom The Hero must learn his ultimate powers. The Hero may even learn from several of them. Getting apprenticeship from these characters may comprise a bulk of the story. Of course, there's nothing stopping a writer from making The Hero into a Master of One Magic, although they usually claim that title only through sheer power alone.\nIf there's any magic-user organization that specializes in one type of magic, you can expect the Master of One Magic to be the head of the group. They're often subject to Crippling Overspecialization, especially if they only rely on the magic they excel at when they can generalize their abilities. Also keep in mind that \"magic\" doesn't always have to go by that name when adding examples. Enlightenment Superpowers, Ki Attacks, Psychic Powers and the like can be counted as well.\nCompare The Archmage, a powerful and learned wizard, which a Master of One Magic often is. Also compare The Red Mage, who isn't a master of any one field but has a nearly unparalleled versatility. Poor, Predictable Rock is when someone is dedicated to a single element in a Elemental Rock\u2013Paper\u2013Scissors universe. Contrast Master of All.\n"}
{"TheSoulSaver": "A character who saves souls from some kind of literal or symbolic hell/limbo. The character might be a preacher, psychologist, psychic or whatever, depending on the setting. In some cases and settings, the saving requires some time and afterthought. In others, a Epiphany Therapy is available.\nMay or may not be a Heaven Seeker: The saving means peace, closure, and often some kind of good life - but it can be either in this life or in some afterlife or release.\nA religious version of The Soulsaver is different from a Soulsaving Crusader in that a Soulsaver does not use the harsh methods that a Soulsaving Crusader employs to \"save\" people.\n"}
{"ColorCodedItemTiers": "Whether you're playing a single-player RPG, or a MMORPG, you're bound to encounter items (weapons, armor, jewelry, etc.) that are divided into at least three tiers of power and rarity that just happen to be Color-Coded for Your Convenience. Rarity gives us a visual indicator of how one item compares to another in terms of game advancement. If rarity didn't exist, there would be more of a need to test or compare stats before you'd even know whether to get excited that you got a particular item. Rarity offers an immediate clue as to whether an available item will be effective against the tier of enemies you'll encounter at your current level\nAs opposed to tropes like Power Glows and Bling of War, Color Coded Item Tiers are strictly non-diegetic, used only to help the player distinguish the item's power through inventory background or item name color. Usually, the colors are, as codified by World of Warcraft, mundane white items, followed by green \"uncommon\" ones, blue \"rare\" ones and purple \"epic\" ones. Sometimes, orange or golden tier of Infinity Plus One Weapons is used as well. The only consistent pattern is that White, Gray and Green are towards the bottom of the tier and Purple and Orange are usually towards the higher end (if they're even there), but whether white is the absolute lowest or purple is the absolute highest or there are 3 or more colors or whatever is up in the air.\nA subtrope of Color-Coded for Your Convenience. Compare with Law of Chromatic Superiority.\n"}
{"DeployableCover": "So, you and your squad are off on a mission. You've got armour, guns, grenades, etc. - everything you need. But there's a catch - on this mission, there is likely to be little cover. What do you do? Take some of your own with you, of course!\nDeployable Cover can be anything from an energy barrier that deflects bullets to a big pavise that can be planted into the ground to protect you from arrow volleys. Often, the deployable cover won't be as durable as natural cover, eventually getting destroyed after it is shot enough (though, in the case of an energy shield, it may reactivate after a short time). It will, however, last indefinitely if it is left alone.\nIf you carry the cover with you whilst making use of it, then it's closer to a shield.\nNothing to do with deplorable covers.\n"}
{"ReminderOfImpossibility": "Nature is funny sometimes. In media, people may actually be able to briefly perform a task they naturally can't for the sake of comedy until they are reminded that they don't have the ability to perform the action in question. The reason they start performing it in the first place is that they are determined with a certain task that they forget they can't do it.\nOf course, once they are reminded that they can't, they may immediately give an Oh, Crap! expression before Reality Ensues. Any moment where somebody does something that shouldn't even be possible applies if it gets pointed out and they immediately stop doing it or it stops working.\nMay be subverted if the reminder is there and the character involved still goes on doing their improbable thing.\nCompare Centipede's Dilemma, which involves a question on their ability rather than a genuine fact on their inability, Forgot I Couldn't Swim, when a character remembers their inability to swim upon jumping into water, This Cannot Be!, and Puff of Logic, which points out their inability to live or even exist. Contrast Forgot I Could Fly, and compare Achievements in Ignorance, which this tends to be set up by.\nFilm \u2014 Animated\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"StreetWalker": "The lowest in the food chain of the sex industry are the hardened sex workers who cling to their job for one reason or another.\nThese are women, usually addicted to some form of illegal drugs, who stand around on street corners in run-down areas. Their Hollywood Dress Code (usually much nicer than what actual crackwhores wear) includes tiny skirts, six-inch plastic heels, rabbit fur jackets or fake fur jackets, a gallon of makeup, and crop tops, even if it's freezing outside.\nAmong the various forms that prostitution can take, streetwalking is easily among the most dangerous \u2014 streetwalkers are at serious risk of being assaulted (physically or sexually), mugged, or outright murdered, and in countries where they operate outside the law (and even some where it's legal), good luck finding police who care. Heck, sometimes it's it's the police themselves that present the biggest threat to her.\nParticularly likely to be the Disposable Sex Worker. Also very common setups for a Dirty Harriet scenario.\nCompare Hooker with a Heart of Gold.\nContrast High-Class Call Girl. Women in the higher echelons of the sex trade may look at a street prostitute with pity (glad not to be in her shoes) or fear (of ending up where she is once their beauty starts to fade).\n"}
{"MassEmpoweringEvent": "In Super Hero stories, there are many, many ways to give the lead super powers. However, sometimes it becomes cost efficient in terms of descriptive effort or setting construction to give every character the same super hero/villain origin story in a Mass Super-Empowering Event.\nThe Mass Super-Empowering Event serves to kick start the series (The Event usually happens in act 1 or 2 of the pilot) and provide a handy reason for the entire cast to get super powers. The Eventnote\u00a0(For some reason, it's usually called \"The Event\" or some capitalized version thereof and the superheroes will never be called superheroes) can be technological, mystical, accidental, deliberate or unexplained, but it always serves as a tangible link between the heroes and villains. Often, it also kills a great number of people in the process, both to discourage repeated usage and/or give the resulting superheroes an aura of pathos - \"I got all these cool powers while all those others died\".\nSo why do authors use this trope? After all, one valid criticism of this trope is that it takes the \"inventiveness\" and diversity out of a Super Hero Origin story by repeating it across several characters. Well, it turns out that having fifty ways a Freak Lab Accident can give you super powers got old, fast, forcing quite a few Meta Origins to be applied to tidy up the place. Another is that it frees the author from having to give exposition on the source of the powers to focus on the characters themselves and the way that they use their new powers, effectively giving more Character Development and characterization by showing how they react to getting great power \u2014 be it betrayal, smugness or responsibility. It neatly provides a ready-made reason for a connection between the hero and villain, especially if one of them (rightly or wrongly) blames the other for causing the event. Lastly, the cause for The Event can be a major plot hook for the hero(es) to unravel throughout the season.\nA sister trope to Meta Origin, in which multiple seemingly unrelated super-empowerings are retconed into having a common origin. Compare Bizarre Baby Boom. Contrast Randomly Gifted.\nAnd of course, due to the nature of the trope, be wary of unmarked spoilers.\n"}
{"PubertySuperPower": "The acquisition of superpowers or abilities at the onset of becoming a teenager, roughly between the ages of 12-16. This is probably to avoid the inherent danger of a child or baby casually using powers in a potentially destructive manner or, if there is one, blowing the Masquerade. However, more often, it works as a rather transparent metaphor for puberty.\nCuriously, few such teens have trouble figuring out How Do I Shot Web?; apparently, the powers are just instinctive. This doesn't stop mentor figures from putting them through Training from Hell to master those abilities, however.\nNearly all current \"dramatic\" superheroes with \"natural\" superpowers (such as Marvel's mutants) receive them as teenagers. In fact, the trope originated with the creation of the X-Men in the 1960s and was probably developed to appeal the overwhelmingly teenage readership of comic books at the time.\nThis in turn was possibly influenced by the folklore about poltergeist manifestations being associated with adolescents, which in turn has been interpreted as a metaphor for sexual awakening.\nSee also Dangerous 16th Birthday. Compare The Call Put Me on Hold. Contrast Growing Up Sucks where a character possesses a power throughout childhood, but loses it at puberty instead.\n"}
{"ChainOfCorrections": "Bob makes a historical/cultural/pop culture reference and Alice thinks he is referring to something entirely different. Bob corrects Alice but this only leads to another correction, which only confuses Alice again. Bob makes another correction and so on and so on.\nJust one mistake and this would just be a simple misunderstanding, but string together a chain of these and Hilarity Ensues.\nDue to the nature of this trope with multiple cultural references in quick succession, some of the allusions may fly over the audience's head. This usually doesn't actually hurt the comedic potential though.\nSee Who's on First? for this trope dealing solely with people with unfortunately confusing names. Compare Sustained Misunderstanding.\n"}
{"Megalodon": "It's basically just a huge freaking shark. Carcharocles megalodon lived from 15.9 to 2.6 million years ago, was at least 15m long at the very minimum and almost certainly grew up to 18 metres, weighed 75 tons (making it the largest undisputed apex predator of all time), and was an apex predator that reigned for 20 million years (20 times longer than most others), specialized in killing whales, and went extinct due to the closing of the Central American Seaway, the migratory, breeding, and hunting grounds of it and its prey. However, in low grade schlock movies, it will be uncovered after being frozen in ice or lurking in deep-sea trenches and go on a superhunting rampage, tracking down our intrepid heroes all over the world before eating Boeing 747's in a single bite while flying.\nThe appeal is simple. As a giant prehistoric shark, it combines the audience-pleasing qualities of dinosaurs, sharks, and giant monsters in general. Evidently, this generation is the one who became film directors because of Steven Spielberg.\nSub-Trope of Threatening Shark, Prehistoric Monster and Sea Monster. Compare Kraken and Leviathan; Giant Squid.\nProbably deserves honorary mention among Stock Dinosaurs, though nobody would mistake it for one.\nNote that \"megalodon\" is the animal's specific epithet, not the generic name, so it should not be capitalized.\nCompare Tyrannosaurus rex.\n"}
{"AwesomeMccoolName": "Sometimes, people grow up with boring names, and they imagine more exciting and exotic names for themselves. If you let this person write a piece of fiction, expect this flair for the exotic to show up in a lot of their characters. Try to imagine this person as a baby or as a toddler and everyone calling them this. Try to imagine the parents who would name them this.\nIt can appear in stories set in a modern-day city, where everyone inexplicably has \"cool\" names. There's no one named Bill, Todd, or John.

{"BuildLikeAnEgyptian": "Quick, think of Ancient Egypt. What's the first thing that comes to mind? With 90% certainty, you're thinking pyramids, and the other 10% of the time you are probably thinking of The Sphinx. And why shouldn't you? The Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest artificial structure on Earth for three and a half millennia and is the only extant example of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\nAncient Egypt is inherently cool. Plenty of writers, primarily in the fantasy genre, like to have pyramids in their works to evoke an Egyptian feel. These will almost always be found in desert areas, and will usually have some sort of curse. Shifting Sand Land levels in video games will usually feature at least one pyramid on the premises. Also, regardless of whether the setting is ancient or new, it will all be made of golden-brown sandstone bricks, without the ivory-and-gold outer skin the pyramids were built with. The walls will be decorated with hieroglyphic inscriptions, usually meaningless, perhaps with some Wadjet eyes and scarabs thrown in for Faux Symbolism. Sarcophagi and mummies are native to here.\nFor cases in which the historical pyramids have something unusual associated with them, see Pyramid Power.\nFor cases where pyramid-shaped buildings show up in science fiction, see Futuristic Pyramid.

{"FusionFic": "A variety of crossover fic where the characters of one or more franchises replace the established characters in yet another franchise. Usually written for the comedic value of the resulting Fish out of Water juxtaposition, although the odd serious/dramatic effort is seen, too.\nThe term has also started to be applied to crossover fics where the metaphysics and backstories of the universes have been fused so they have always existed as part of the same setting. As a result, rather than the characters being simply swapped, the backstories and worlds of both franchises are altered so they can exist together. For example, a villain from one show might be \"revealed\" to have been part of a conspiracy with similar goals from the other show, thus linking the two and leaving the protagonists likely to come into contact as they each fight against the conspiracy.\nSometimes overlaps with Meta Fic, Elsewhere Fic, and Transplanted Character Fic (the latter two usually simultaneously). Film Fic is a subtrope. Compare the more typical Intercontinuity Crossover. Has no relation whatsoever to Fusion Dance or that nuclear stuff going on in the Sun's core or a custom DeLorean.\n"}

Often the scene will first focus on one or two students not following the class, before an unidentified object flies towards them and gets their attention back to an irritated teacher.\nIt is usually Played for Laughs, and the chalk sticks will be thrown with uncanny accuracy against the kids' heads, showing that the teacher has a long \"experience\" in this domain.\nThe Badass Teacher and Sadist Teacher will often use this technique as a way to quell troublemakers, with the Stern Teacher also occasionally getting in on it.\nA Discredited Trope in Real Life Western education systems. (A teacher throwing things at his pupils is likely to find himself out of a job in short order.)\nSee also School Teachers. Nothing to do with the series ChalkZone.\n"}
{"CardBattleGame": "A genre of video game that is essentially an electronic Collectible Card Game. It may be an exact conversion of a real-world game, or it may be something entirely new. If it's a new game, there will probably be rules and game mechanics that wouldn't be possible in a real-world game. If the game has a plot, of course, you can expect the card game to be Serious Business, maybe even not being considered a \"game\" despite the obvious rules workings.\nTo simulate real Collectible Card Games, you'll have to get cards randomly rather than choosing the ones you want (though in real life, you can usually find single cards in game stores), either by receiving them after battles or by buying booster packs at an in-game shop.\nA Sister Trope to Fight Like a Card Player.\n"}
{"SelectiveGravity": "Could be considered the video game version of Gravity Is a Harsh Mistress.\nSimply put, in just about every video game ever created, most notably platformers, gravity is applied only to some things whilst everything else is completely immune to it. Sometimes, gravity will even apply differently to different things. Where you will always plummet down, everything else could be completely inert, or maybe they could fly directly at the player with no explanation, or perhaps they could even fall up.\nWhile gravity in a game can clearly exist, you and your enemies being susceptible to it, you will find that special objects, projectiles, power-ups, rows of blocks, coins, entire platforms and even some enemies can simply levitate motionless in the air with no wings or otherwise believable means of overcoming gravity's supposed pull. This is especially prevalent in space levels. Even objects that are on the ground, lie in a position where they should fall in Real Life, for an example, coins being upright.\nYou, on the other hand, can rest assured that you will always plunge to your death if you step off the edge of a cliff. The player is always gravity's bitch. (Except if you happen to be playing a Digging Game; then it works the other way around entirely.)\nNot to be confused with specific gravity.\n"}
{"Oni": "Oni are brutish mountain Youkai similar to Trolls and Ogres, with either one or two horns (which in some depictions are the source of their power). The word is almost always translated into English as \"ogres\" or \"demons\". They are sometimes depicted as good or bad, but are usually morally neutral and interested in their own affairs. They prefer huge bludgeoning weapons (iron clubs called kanabou being the most common) and hide loincloths (usually tiger-striped). They are also shown to really love their alcohol, which can make them even more rowdy. Sometimes blamed for streaks of misfortune. Others work jobs in Fire and Brimstone Hell as big red devils.\nIf Oni come in pairs, there's a good chance one will be red and the other blue. However, they won't always match the Red Oni, Blue Oni dynamics. If some Oni are explicitly female, Bizarre Sexual Dimorphism may occur with males looking Gonky and the females looking more conventionally attractive. Which is consistent with their mythological descriptions.\n\"Oni\" originally referred to misfortune, bad vibes and evil spirits, which were traditionally said to come from the northeast. Under the Eastern Zodiac this is known as the \"ox-tiger\" direction, so these forces came to be anthropomorphised as beings with features of oxen and tigers. Because they're Made of Evil (or at least Made of Chaos), supernatural powers used by oni are often classified as jujutsu (\"hexes\", \"maleficium\" or \"witchcraft\") even when they're overt or harmless.\nSometimes particularly wild and brutish humans are depicted as transforming into oni as they are warped by the foul energies surrounding them. At some points in Japanese history the word \"oni\" became practically synonymous with \"barbarian\", and conquering or pacifying territories was described as \"ridding lands of oni\".\nParticularly powerful oni may be described as kishin (literally \"oni god\"; the \"ki\" is an Alternate Character Reading of \"oni\"), a term used in Japanese Buddhism to refer to Wrathful Deities. Incidentally, the Japanese word for vampire (kyuuketsuki) can be translated as \"blood-sucking oni\"; see here for details.\nHyakki Yakou, the Japanese equivalent of The Wild Hunt, literally translates as \"Night Parade of 100 Oni\", though this usage is metaphorical (most depictions of the Parade include a wide variety of Youkai) and is usually glossed as \"demons\" even when oni is otherwise left untranslated. That said, it has lead to a number of works that use some variant of \"Hyakki\" (or worse, \"Senki\"note\u00a0\"1,000 oni\") as a name or title for a particularly powerful oni; in more literal cases they may even be 100 demons fused together into an Eldritch Abomination.\nCompare Horned Humanoid. For western counterparts, see Our Ogres Are Hungrier and All Trolls Are Different (and occasionally Our Demons Are Different).\nSee also Smash Mook (and some Oni in video games will be that kind of enemy).\n"}
{"GenreTurningPoint": "While a Wham Episode can change a single series forever... sometimes, something comes out that permanently alters an entire genre. It wasn't the first entry into the genre, nor was it the last, but things were never the same after it came out. This often \u2014 but far from exclusively \u2014 happens with particularly notable Deconstructions; once one story has pointed how a certain genre will play out in reality this can cause a ripple effect across other stories in the genre. However, it doesn't always have to be a Deconstruction. Some shows can radically redefine a genre without taking it apart. Reconstructions can have the same effect; incorporating realistic elements into the old-school storytelling can make the genre look new again.\nUsually seen as a good thing, although there are genre fans who will feel negatively about it.\nCompare Wham Episode, Genre-Killer, From Clones to Genre, Genre Relaunch, Follow the Leader. Good chance of being a Trope Maker or Trope Codifier.\nNot to confuse with Genre Shift, where the work itself shifts its genre at the middle.\n"}
{"ManBehindTheCurtain": "After infiltrating the fortress of evil, fighting off hordes of Mooks, successfully navigating the Death Course and laying the almighty smackdown on The Dragon, you finally reach the Evil Sorcerer's inner sanctum. You charge in, ready to face the Man Behind the Man and kick some ass...\nWait a second, since when was Baron Von Ruthless a bedridden feeble old man with leukemia? And why does he have a dry ice machine?\nSometimes the Big Bad is disappointingly small. Sometimes the Ultimate Evil is far less ultimate than you were led to believe. Sometimes The Man Behind the Man is just the The Man Behind The Curtain: a villain who falls depressingly short of their own hype. More deserving of a slap across the face than a pummeling (but even that might kill them), they are not even a remotely credible threat to the heroes. You want to hate them, but all you can muster up is pity.\nIf this happens in a serious story, expect the audience to be ticked when they find out the long-awaited big fight is going to be really one-sided, if it happens at all. Of course, really crafty Men Behind The Curtain make sure that the hero is significantly weakened by the time they get to him, either through exhaustion from fighting everyone before him or doing something very sneaky and underhanded to him before the fight begins. Then again, there may well be Truth in Television Justification for this; after all, a commander without an army is effectively useless. Of course, Tropes Are Not Bad; in a cynical-realistic show with Anyone Can Die and Reality Ensues in full force, it would be jarring if the enemy is thoroughly outmatched but still poses a threat in person.\nAnticlimax Boss is a Video Game-specific subtrope. For the inverse of this trope, see Fluffy the Terrible. Contrast with Villain Decay and Authority Equals Asskicking. May use the Fake Special Attack. Has surprisingly little to do with Curtain Camouflage or the Dramatic Curtain Toss, though some examples may have those as well.\nBy this trope's very nature, all examples will be SPOILERS. You have been warned.\n"}
{"GoneMadFromTheIsolation": "\nExtended social isolation that makes a person go crazy. People who are stranded alone will usually be subject to this. A person on a ship or in space where it is months or years until they reach their destination are also at risk. Solitary confinement can be a way of invoking this as punishment.\nRelated to Tailor-Made Prison and Bored with Insanity (for when the isolation induced crazy waxes, then wanes). And I Must Scream is an extreme version of this which often goes with total immobilization and/or sensory deprivation.\nVarious techniques can be employed to deal with loneliness, such as maintaining a strict daily schedule or keeping a diary. In comedy, it's often demonstrated by having the character talk to objects or an Imaginary Friend to alleviate their suffering.\nA common effect is for them to greet actual rescues with the belief that they are dreaming, or have gone mad. For years after escape, Bad Dreams may throw them back into the belief they are still a prisoner.\nAnd I Must Scream scenarios often play off of this as a Primal Fear.\nTruth in Television, as studies of prisoners in solitary confinement show.\nSee also Hermit Guru, Cabin Fever, and Loners Are Freaks. Sub-Trope of The Aloner. Experiences like these in solitary confinement can lead someone to declare that they're Never Going Back to Prison and would die first.\n"}
{"TheWomanBehindTheMan": "When a character previously positioned as a Big Bad is revealed in fact to be either the flunky, puppet, or spokesman for a higher authority. Note that gender of either is not relevant, so this trope could include The Woman Behind the Man, The Woman Behind the Woman, or The Man Behind the Woman.\nThe Man has deeper motives, bigger designs, and more power than the hero(es) could ever hope to smash in one blow; they will usually have to go through another round of dungeon diving just to stand a chance. When they reveal thier reasons for being evil, expect the theme of the plot to unfold quickly and dramatically.\nIn many genres, the Man Behind the Man often has more sinister and apocalyptic goals than their predecessor. For example, while a Puppet King or greedy Mega-Corp may want to Take Over the World, the real Big Bad may want to destroy the world, or even erase all of existence.\nCan be reversed as \"The Man in Front of the Man\", in which case a person you thought was the Big Bad's crony turns out to be the real Big Bad. See also Bastard Understudy, Dragon-in-Chief, and Dragon Ascendant. May be the one pulling the strings of the Puppet King.\nContrast Chessmaster Sidekick and Decoy Leader. In some (unsatisfying) occasions, The Man Behind The Man may be The Man Behind the Curtain. If there is no first man to begin with, or the first man is very obviously not the Big Bad, it's a Hidden Villain. If the mastermind turns out to be an innocuous character who was quickly overlooked, then it's a case of The Dog Was the Mastermind. If the Man Behind the Man is a previously-fought villain, then the plot has been Hijacked by Ganon. Sufficiently complex plots may involve The Man Behind The Man Behind The Man and so forth; the Sorting Algorithm of Evil usually, but not always, applies in these cases. Do this many times within a story (optionally mixed with the aforementioned tropes) and you have The Big Bad Shuffle.\nCompare and contrast Greater-Scope Villain, where a villain more powerful than the Big Bad exists, but is either not personally involved in the plot or is not a \"person\" to begin with. Not to do with a Gambit Pileup, though you might get one if everyone is trying to manipulate each other. This trope and/or Greater-Scope Villain may also come into play if the villains are terrorists backed by larger powers like Dirty Communists or Corrupt Corporate Executives.\nRarely involves The Man, unless he was the one who created the personified conceptual authority on the first place.\nBecause this trope is often used as The Reveal whenever it appears, beware of spoilers.\n"}
{"RemovableShell": "In Real Life, a turtle's shell is fused to its spine (It is, after all, a modified rib cage). Removing a shell in Real Life, if possible at all, will kill the turtle in seconds if the turtle is lucky. But in fiction, it is often treated as a removable article of clothing. Expect the turtle, when out of the shell, to be wearing little more than Goofy Print Underwear.\nAlternately, the shell may be large enough to not only accommodate the resident turtle, but also allow somebody else to hide inside it at the same time. In some cases, the Removable Shell may also be portrayed as having a furnished apartment (and often Bigger on the Inside). Another variant will be for the turtle to withdraw all of its limbs (and its head) to make them pop out so that it does a 180 degree turn without moving from the spot. Slow animals with removed shells may become much faster.\nA variant can apply to other shelled animals like snails, which also - with the exception of hermit crabs - are fused to their shells and cannot \"take them off\".\nSub-Trope of Art Major Biology, Appropriate Animal Attire, and Funny Animal Anatomy.\nCompare Fur Is Clothing (the mammalian equivalent).\nContrast Eggshell Clothing (the shell that is supposed to come off does not).\n"}
{"ImpossibleLeavening": "In comedy shows, yeast tends to be treated as far more volatile and powerful than it actually is. A less than stellar baker will add more yeast to a recipe than it needs, often many times more, and the dough reacts explosively. If you're lucky, all that you get is a mess in the kitchen, or a pizza that nearly fills the oven as it bakes. However, it's just as common to see the dough explode all over the kitchen or, in extreme cases, come to life. Occasionally, baking powder and baking soda, also known for their leavening properties, can cause much the same problems.\nCompare Oven Logic, for when the disaster is the result of temperature instead of yeast. If the aspiring chef combines the two, you might as well just start saving for a new kitchen altogether.\n"}
{"NativeAmericanCasino": "Wherever there's an Indian reservation in Movieland, there has to be a casino.\nThis is partly Truth in Television. In the United States, a series of legal decisions that began with Bryan v. Itasca County in 1976 and ended with the creation of the National Indian Gaming Commission in 1988 established that Native American tribal reservations who set up a \"tribal-state compact\" with their state are exempt from any state gambling bans or regulation (though they are still subject to federal regulation).\nSince reservations are typically among the poorest and least developed parts of the nation, the upside is that giving them a monopoly on gaming is a way to attract tourists and jump-start reservation economies. The downside is that impoverished residents can be attracted to addictive gambling, and there is no guarantee that the casinos will enrich anyone but the tribal councils. Lately, the governments of smaller tribes have been disenrolling members so that casino profits are spread among fewer people.\n"}
{"ReallyFondOfSleeping": "This trope describes a character that just loves sleeping. They frequently take naps and may outright consider sleeping to be an art or hobby.\nOften they will take their going to sleep routine very seriously because for them, it's a ritual. What they eat and drink before going to bed is important \u2014 a glass of warm milk is common. They are likely to wear a nice pyjamas and perhaps even a night cap. They will pay attention to the place where they sleep: a nice couch at the office will do just fine, but at home they will have a good bed with fluffy pillows, a nice comforter and clean, freshly washed sheets. A sweet pet bed is a variant for animals. They will often beg for Five More Minutes when woken up or violently attack the awaker.\nThe reasons for this vary: They might really dislike active lifestyle and action-oriented hobbies. They can be fond of vivid dreams and extra adventures and memories they provide. They might be aware that lack of sleep will make them cranky and annoying. Perhaps they just love how fresh and alert they feel when they wake up after a really good night's sleep. It might help them to focus. Or they can be simply too lazy for other hobbies and interests. They might be The Sleepless who really longs to sleep.\nCompare Big Eater who has a similar attitude towards eating and often has this trait. Often overlaps with Heavy Sleeper (hard to wake up), Sleepyhead (dozes off often, whether they want to or not), An Odd Place to Sleep (falling asleep in at almost any place), and Not a Morning Person (people who dislike waking up and morning routines).\n"}
{"TableTopGames": "Tabletop games are games which don't involve physical competition (separating them from sports) or electronic devices (separating them from Video Games). It's generally agreed that a tabletop game must involve some physical objects, otherwise it would be a Parlor Game. A table is not required, however; most tabletop games can also be played sitting on the floor or standing up, but a table is usually the most convenient option.\nThere are many different categories of tabletop games, including:\nAnd then there are lots of games that don't fit into any of these categories very well, from Mahjong to Connect Four.\nOf course, the variety in gameplay is also enormous. Two aspects in which tabletop games can differ quite significantly are hidden information and random elements. For example, in chess, there is no hidden information and no randomness; everything is determined by the players' own actions, and everything in the game is revealed to both players. In Stratego and Diplomacy, there are no random elements either, but the amount of hidden information is huge, and deceiving your opponent(s) is an important part of gameplay. In the Game of the Goose, there is no hidden information, but the randomness is turned Up to Eleven \u2013 everything is random, and players have zero control over the outcome of the game. Poker is a good example of a game that features both random elements (which cards you are dealt) and hidden information (your opponents' hands). Most games likewise have a little of both. There also exist games which incorporate other media in addition to the base content of the game, such as those which involve a VHS tape or DVD to display in tandem with the physical game, introducing further elements and events during play.\nRecently, Wil Wheaton has promoted the board game hobby with his web series, Tabletop, where he and several 'geek celebrities' (famous geeks and people involved in cult nerd shows and projects, oftentimes both) play a variety of board games, from Settlers of Catan to Ticket to Ride to the Dragon Age tabletop RPG campaign. It can be watched here as well as from YouTube, and has gone through two seasons at the time of this writing.\nSee Tabletop Game Tropes for tropes that apply to tabletop games and Game Tropes for a more general index.\n"}
{"AnAdventurerIsYou": "Hunt dragons and delve in the forgotten lore of a High Fantasy epic! Explore the galaxy and conquer alien planets in a science fiction universe! Balance your chi and master the martial arts in ancient China! An Adventurer is You! You can do anything!\nWell, anything that your Class allows you to do. Games with a class-based system \u2014 such as almost every MMORPG out there, many Tabletop Games, and some other games such as RTSes or TBSes with RPG Elements \u2014 will provide distinct Classes that usually fall somewhere along the lines of various archetypal class roles, such as the Tank, the Healer, the Damage Specialist, the Trickster, etc.\nSo then, who IS The Hero, I hear you ask? Everyone is! The point of this system is to provide everyone with an important role, and for developers to ensure that players will be able to grasp game mechanics and battle tactics faster. If any Player wants to be the leader, his own personal ability is much more important than their Class.\nAn Adventurer is You is a set of the most basic and common such character classes that players can take for their characters.\n(What'd you say? ...Oh, well, the Trope Namer is Kingdom of Loathing, which got the name from a certain bit of Engrish in the NES game Pro Wrestling.)\nThese classes are examples of Splats, and most Splats will reflect some of their attributes.\nCompare and contrast Competitive Balance, where each character is designed to stand alone and compete with any of the others, rather than work together. See also Common Character Classes, Fantasy Character Classes, PVP Balanced, and the Player Party index.\n"}
{"AloofDarkhairedGirl": "The Aloof Dark-Haired Girl is a fairly common character type combining both appearance and personality. They will generally be taller than their peers, more physically developed, and their hair will be very long and dark. Frequently, their skin will in contrast be very pale. They look older and more beautiful and meet a certain classic ideal of feminine beauty combining maturity, a quiet attitude and a combination of long hair and very pale skin.\nThe Aloof Dark-haired Girl will not merely look older than her peers, however. Frequently, she will also act more reserved and aloof and thus seem more mature, which may earn her some younger female admirers. It is not uncommon for them to be fond of teasing their peers or acting as their big sisters, though in all cases they will still maintain their dignity. Occasionally, she will even look cold and distant, but in this case she is still probably a nice person deep down. Finally, it is essential to remember that despite the usual popularity of the girl in question, they do not seek it out. Instead, people simply gravitate towards them with admiration.\nSee Tall, Dark, and Handsome for the Spear Counterpart. Compare Onee-sama and Eerie Pale-Skinned Brunette. May lead to Even the Girls Want Her in the right sort of series.\n"}
{"AdoptedIntoRoyalty": "Conventionally, being a King, Queen, or a Princess requires you to be born as one, Royal Blood is valuable after all, and as far as most monarchs are concerned, they have to make sure their bloodline keeps going if they want their kingdoms to last.\nBut when you're this character, it's another story.\nMaybe you got a father who was lucky enough to marry a queen, maybe you reported and helped stop a coup attempt and the royal family saw adopting you as a way of thanking you, maybe you're already of some position and are adopted into the family as a political fodder, or maybe you just befriended a prince and he liked you enough that he came to his father and begged him (if not outright demanded) you get adopted into the royal family so you and he could spend more time together. However it happened, you're suddenly now at the top of the food chain of society, we hope you're comfortable (and you likely will be.)\nLike adoptions everywhere else, being adopted into a royal family can have varied results ranging from being straight up Happily Adopted to their adoptive royal parents viewing them with contempt and outright abusing their adopted child. Though regardless, usually the adoptee still gets to enjoy all (or at least some of) the luxuries and privileges that go with their newfound status and tend to have similar royal duties that go with it as well. There's usually unlikely the adoptee will ever inherit the throne as their adoptive siblings are blood heirs destined for it anyway, and most royal adoptees tend not to be bothered by this and even appreciate that fact as it means they won't have to worry about the pressures of being a king or queen.\n...unless a coup attempt or some other freak disaster wipes out their royal adoptive family and the following Succession Crisis leaves the entire kingdom desperate enough to put the sole-surviving adoptee on the throne, to their own surprise and possible dismay.\nA subtrope of Rags to Royalty. Contrast Really Royalty Reveal, where the character was royalty all along.\n"}
{"ImaHumanitarian": "If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?\nNo, this trope is not about humanitarianism. Quite the opposite, in fact.\nCannibalism is considered one of the greatest taboos, so, naturally, it's become a trope. One idea which stands out is that human flesh is superficially similar to swine flesh, hence the nickname \"long pig\" and the phrase \"eating the long pork\". note\u00a0It's also sometimes called \"the other white meat\", but it is in fact red, as all mammalian meat is. A robot designed to taste wine corroborates this idea. Thus, it should be delicious, which is reflected both in Hannibal Lecter's gourmet tastes, and in the idea in Sweeney Todd that pies with this ingredient would sell like hot cakes. Or hot pies.\nYou'll often have people eat something and not know what it is, and then discover the ghastly truth, such as in many an Inn of No Return.\nA mostly Discredited Trope (see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest for an exception) is a variation that portrays members of non-European societies as cannibalistic, often attempting to cook visiting Europeans in a pot (see Cannibal Film for the Exploitation subgenre based on this).\nIn Speculative Fiction, cannibalism is generally extended to include eating all sapient or humanoid creatures, even if they aren't technically eating their own species. Any species that includes humans (or other humanoids) in its diet is usually portrayed as villainous, as is any species that routinely eats members of its own social group. Likewise, humans treating other sapient species as food are rarely treated sympathetically (unless What Measure Is a Non-Human? is in effect). If an alien or monster race make a practice of eating their own (as well as or instead of humans), then we have a case of Monstrous Cannibalism.\nTo various degrees, anthropophagynote\u00a0This, and related, terms are technically more appropriate than \"cannibalism\" for a non-human species that eats humans. It's actually more common for works to get this wrong than for them to get it right, possibly because Greek is no longer commonly taught and therefore \"anthropophage\" just doesn't have that same frisson of terror that \"cannibal\" does. is usually expected of Zombie Mooks.\nIf the cannibal systematically hunts down people on a regular basis so he/she can eat them, they'll be a Serial Killer as well.\nA subtrope of I Ate WHAT?! and Human Resources. Can also involve Carnivore Confusion without furries (or maybe with furries - see the paragraph on Speculative Fiction above.) See To Serve Man for when Aliens and Monsters find us tasty. Picky People Eater and Brain Food is for those not interested in mere muscles. See also Let's Meet the Meat. Compare No Party Like a Donner Party, in which persons are forced into cannibalism due to starvation, or The Secret of Long Pork Pies, for when someone is unknowingly tricked into it. And when you get down to the bitter dregs, there's Auto Cannibalism. Also see Fattening the Victim, where people are fattened before being eaten.\nNote that this trope applies to non-humans who are sentient or otherwise capable of independent thought or communication even if they only eat their own kind. Likewise this trope is not about anyone eating humans. It's about cannibalism.\nTruth in Television, and often so disturbing we ask No Real Life Examples, Please!\n"}
{"FifteenPuzzle": "The \"fifteen puzzle\" or \"slide puzzle\" is a sort of Stock Puzzle where one has to arrange a set of scrambled numbers so that they are all shown in ascending order. One spot is always open, allowing pieces to be moved around, but it is designed in such a way that no piece can ever be removed from the board. There are larger versions with more than than fifteen squares; these are called \"n-puzzles\", where n is the number of scrambled numbers (always a square number minus one).\nA more general version of the \"sliding puzzle\" will have the player try to put together an image in the same manner as above. The picture you're trying to reassemble is usually printed on the back of the box to minimize frustration.\nThe puzzle traces back at least to Noyes Palmer Chapman in 1874; later on, Sam Loyd claimed to have invented it. Loyd did at least popularise the puzzle, by offering a huge prize each week in a newspaper advertisement for those who solved a certain configuration. He had analysed the puzzle and proved that half of all configurations are impossible to solve, naturally including the one in question, and thus nobody ever won the huge prize he offered.\n"}
{"LevelUpAtIntimacy5": "There are a lot of games out there that want to encourage relationships, romance, and sex between the characters: a game where you Level-Up At Intimacy 5 actually makes your character stronger or gives them additional capabilities for doing so, usually by having increased Relationship Values correspond exactly to combat modifiers - say, Intimacy Dice in Bliss Stage or the powers of your various Personas.\nUsually, the explanation for how hitting on people could possibly make you more powerful is that your Applied Phlebotinum weaponry is powered by intense emotions; sometimes this is coupled with the idea that you're fighting a Being Of (Im)Pure Thought.\nThe purpose of this trope is to encourage a player to take romantic and sexual actions, making it a trope specific to games \u2014 a sort of literal interpretation of Friends with Benefits. Dating Sims love this trope, for obvious reasons.\nA subtrope of Deus Sex Machina. Can involve Power Perversion Potential. A weaponized verson of The Power of Love, The Power of Friendship, and The Power of Lust. May or may not be Intimate Healing. The opposite of Virgin Power. Often used with You Lose at Zero Trust. When being The Casanova is more effective than being a Dogged Nice Guy, that's More Friends, More Benefits. Compare Optional Sexual Encounter.\n"}
{"MyRealDaddy": "One fun aspect of being a fan is that you can ascribe Word of God selectively. Sure, Alice may own the franchise, but it's Bob \u2014 the writer, the producer, whatever \u2014 who left such an indelible impression on the property that, in your opinion, Bob is the one who made it good.\nThis trope is, naturally, more common with long-running properties with multiple creators, which is why there are so many examples from American Comic Books. When a character like Superman or Batman has literally thousands of stories told by hundreds of writers over a period of many decades, it's not surprising that this trope comes into play.\nCompare Adaptation Displacement, Cant Un Hear It, Better Than Canon, and Covered Up. When done with a singular character, it may be a result of being the Creator's Favorite. Contrast Running the Asylum, where such people are often regarded as evil step-parents, and Only the Creator Does It Right, where fans think a work is better when its creator is actively involved in it.\n"}
{"PowerEqualsRarity": "Let's face it: in Real Life, if a weapon is powerful, it's mass-produced. If an animal is powerful, it flourishes. If a nation is powerful, it can effectively Take Over the World.\nThat's not the case with games, though. Generally, for balancing purposes or Bribing Your Way to Victory, the more powerful an item/mon/etc. is in a game, the harder it is to find. While various reasons are given in the plot (if at all) as to why these things are so rare, in the meta-sense, it's for balance. If the player has unlimited access to game-changing stuff, then the game is tipped entirely in their favor.\nThis is seen most commonly in Role Playing Games, both tabletop and video, so that the character/party doesn't get so powerful the Big Bad is killed off as fast as a mook, and in collectible games, so that not every player has a game-breaker, and the number of game-breakers out there are limited. Sometimes, the rules of a game specifically will limit an item/mon/card/etc. to only one per player (often retroactively after that item is banned).\nEven in games where the creators actively say that rarity means crap in relevance to power, many people will still associate rarity with overall power, even when it isn't. In certain TCG formats, the disproportionate distribution of power between the common and rare cards could lead to fake balance.\nInterestingly, putting too much of the power in rare is actually extremely bad for a game, as it discourages newbies from buying into the game as they get beaten over and over again by people who own better cards than they, and discourages players from buying into the game in the first place.\nThe basic reasoning for this may come from, of all things, history and mythology, wherein the most powerful items, supposedly-magical or knowingly mundane, were of exceptional quality, but very scarce. This is understandable, though, because the time, resources, and skill needed to create any weapon beyond a sharp stick or axe was great, and an exceptional weapon like Excalibur or Durandal could, realistically, be made only once in an artisan's lifetime (and was probably the most valuable item in a king's treasury for good reason). Another reason for an item's rarity might be that the owner has taken steps to ensure that its creator cannot repeat the work.\nFor a video game item (MMOs in particular) that's exceptionally rare and powerful, it has a chance of causing Loot Drama.\nContrast Junk Rare and Promotional Powerless Piece of Garbage for the \"rare\" and \"promo\" inversions of this trope. Compare Game-Breaker for a retroactive application of this trope, for when something is so broken you might only be able to use one in a deck/army/etc. Often present in games with Level-Locked Loot. Related to Commonplace Rare, when a useful item that by all logic should be easy to get turns out to be extremely difficult. Subtrope of Quality Vs Quantity.\nHas absolutely nothing to do with a certain fashion-designing unicorn.\n"}
{"DeadFromTheStart": "A character, dead from the start or killed very early in a work, who is either depicted as The Ghost (not literally) or developed entirely via flashbacks. May make heavy use of Posthumous Narration. Averts We Hardly Knew Ye. Video Wills, Apocalyptic Log, suicide notes, and mention by other characters on what he or she was like may help.\nExpect them to appear in a Happier Home Movie, which the protagonist will watch over and over until he realizes It's All Junk.\nThe Afterlife may be used as a Framing Device.\nThe Lost Lenore is often such a character. Undead characters don't count. The effect should be that, despite a character being, you know, DEAD, they still have as large a part in what's going on as the rest of the characters, or at the very least results in the viewer getting to know the character surprisingly well.\nGenerally this character's demise is a Plot-Triggering Death. Compare with Dead Star Walking and Dead All Along. Contrast with Forgotten Fallen Friend. See also Death by Origin Story. The Predecessor Villain is often a specific type of Posthumous Character. Greater-Scope Villain can be a villain version of this trope, depending on how it's used. Starts with Their Funeral can lead to this trope if the dead character is shown in flashbacks.\n"}
{"PeekaBooCorpse": "The heroine has just escaped from the Serial Killer or the gruesome corporeal manifestation of the Cosmic Horror and is running through the Haunted House, desperately trying to find a means of escape. She's managed to avoid tripping over her own feet and falling like an idiot, and if she can just make it through this next upcoming door, she may just be able to make it to the outside world and sweet, sweet freedom!\nShe opens the door... only to find herself standing nose to nose with a decayed, maggoty, slack-jawed corpse...\nCue Scare Chord. Cue also a huge scream from the heroine and from any traumatized 8-year olds who may have the misfortune to be watching this show.\nYes. Once again, the Peek-a-Boo Corpse \u2014 the bane of squeamish horror movie watchers everywhere \u2014 has made an appearance, rearing its ugly, eyeless, wormy head and worming its way into the nightmares of kids and adults alike.\nIf you're a naive moviewatcher (e.g., a child), there is no defense from the Peek-a-Boo Corpse, for there is no way to see it coming. Even if you've had some experience watching horror movies (and you can pretty much tell if a desperate Damsel in Distress is going to run into trouble), there are still times and places when the Peek-a-Boo Corpse will pop out unexpectedly, scaring the bejeezus out of even the most hardened of horror fans, especially if it's a particularly hideous one. Most Peek-a-Boo Corpses like to hang around haunted houses and cemeteries, but occasionally they'll turn up in clean and innocuous environments where you'd least expect them (and where they'll have maximum shock value). A common way to find out if an ordinary, non-suspicious character is actually a villain is to have the heroine stumble upon a Peek-a-Boo Corpse hidden in their closet or basement. (Unfortunately, for the heroine, the villain is usually close by, watching this development, if they're not actively chasing her already.)\nYou can expect the identity of the Peek-a-Boo Corpse to be:\nIn order for a body to qualify as a Peek-a-Boo Corpse , its appearance must somehow jolt the viewer and the person finding it should either be (a) actively engaged in a search for something else or (b) running to escape some real or perceived danger. Note: In the event that the half-destroyed corpse-like body of the villain should pop out and scare the heroes after they had mistakenly thought that they had laid it to rest, it technically doesn't qualify as a Peek-a-Boo Corpse moment (the main reason being that... well... the villain isn't entirely a corpse yet...)\nCompare Cat Scare and Spring-Loaded Corpse. If the corpse playing peek-a-boo was hidden in an extremely odd location, that's Body in a Breadbox. If they were found on the ceiling, that's Ceiling Corpse.\n"}
{"AnatomyAnomaly": "In animation, it's fairly common for characters to be depicted differently from what you'd expect from real life (usually missing the little finger), especially from the anatomical point, mostly due to simplification of the human/animal figure represented. Sometimes though, one or more characters in particular on a show will be depicted in a way distinctive from the rest of the cast. Normally, they either:\nOf course, this trope applies only when one or a few characters among the whole cast of the show are depicted with less or more detail than the greatest part of the cast. After all, it's almost impossible to determine a norm if there is none to start with.\nRelated to Tertiary Sexual Characteristics: in many cartoons, only females have visible lips and eyelashes.\nSuper trope to the first type of The Noseless, sub-trope of Non-Standard Character Design and Animals Lack Attributes. Related to Invisible Anatomy.\n"}
{"EvilRegent": "Sometimes it's the monarch/Head of State who's the Evil Overlord. And sometimes there's this trope, where instead of the Head of State being the person who has malicious intent, it's his adviser, assistant, second-in-command, or Head of Government (that is if the Head of State and Head of Government are separate positions, such as with having both a President and a Prime Minister, respectively). Most of the time he's actively scheming to discredit or usurp the throne, and may even be an agent sent for this purpose by an outside power. In other cases, he's perfectly content to be The Man Behind the Man and keeps the ruler around primarily as the figurehead for the ignorant masses and as the fall guy if something goes wrong. He can also tend to have more actual power and real influence than the Head of State, especially in cases where the government is a parliamentary system or a constitutional monarchy.\nSometimes called the Evil (Grand) Vizier instead, in which case he will spend a lot of time tapping his fingertips together and calling everyone \"effendi\". The \"Evil High Priest\" is a closely related phenomenon, with some Sinister Minister and Corrupt Church thrown in.\nIn stories set in Presidential democratic societies, an Evil Vice President may play the same role, although it is a lot less common. In the American political system in particular, there is a fairly legitimate reason why the vice president is an illogical position to be filled by someone evil: by default, the vice president (generally) has very little actual power, unless the president is incapacitated or has delegated significant amounts of formal authority to the vice president. However, if the Vice President is planning to have the President be assassinated or the President is an easily controlled fool, this trope would easily apply.\nWhile Chancellors, Vice Presidents, and the like may not always be examples of this trope merely by having the job, the title \"Grand Vizier\" might as well just include \"Evil\" as part of it, in the eyes of English-speaking audiences, especially if the Vizier's name is some version of \"Jafar\". If you see a non-evil Grand Vizier, the author is probably playing with the trope... or you're talking about Real Life (the historical Ja'far ibn Yahya, while a Vizier, was not particularly Evil, and in general \"vizier\" is just the Persian-influenced Muslim world's word for \"[government] minister\"). The word \"Chancellor\" itself has also got a bad taste in English countries, due to one of the most famous real-life codifiers of the Evil Chancellor character.\nMalicious Slander is a particular favorite of the Evil Chancellor.\nAs cliched as this trope may seem, it is often justified in that if anybody's going to usurp the reigning ruler through manipulation and intrigue, it's going to be the guy who actually has the authority to replace him. Part of the basis of this trope may also come from the context in which stories are written; in a monarchy, it can be dangerous to tell stories about an evil king, so pushing all the blame onto an evil adviser is an easy way out. This extends into political commentary as well \u2014 it is safer to vilify an adviser for hated policies than the leader themselves.\nIf only the King thinks the evil chancellor is his most trusted and loyal subject, he's a Horrible Judge of Character and a Clueless Boss. When only the protagonists see through the evil of this character, it's a Devil in Plain Sight. If he doesn't want to steal the throne himself, then his goal is almost certainly to turn the ruler he allegedly serves into a Puppet King.\nThis trope is the Evil Counterpart of The Good Chancellor. See also: The Evil Prince, who is usually also after the throne and rather less willing to remain in the shadows. In fantasy settings, will often overlap with an Evil Sorcerer; if his \"official\" job is to be the ruler's personal magic-user, then he's also the Court Mage. In settings with a strong Asian or Middle Eastern influence, expect overlap with Eunuchs Are Evil. Aspiring backstabbers may refer to the Evil Chancellor List. If the ruler the Evil Chancellor \"serves\" is also evil, that's The Starscream.\nIn terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are The Good Chancellor, Lady Macbeth (when it's the Queen/First Lady who's doing the scheming), Standard Royal Court and Deadly Decadent Court. The next steps up are The Evil Prince, Prince Charming, Prince Charmless, Warrior Prince, Princely Young Man, The Wise Prince, and all Princess Tropes. The next step down is The Brigadier. Also see Treacherous Advisor.\nCompare Dragon with an Agenda.\n"}
{"ChainMailBikini": "Usually when you include sexy characters in a work, you want to put them in revealing clothing for maximum fanservice. But what if these characters are warriors who are expected to wear armor into battle? Whether the technology of the setting calls for mail shirts, full plate armor, ballistic vests, or Space Marine suits, most types of practical armor hide all the \"good parts\" under layers of protection. Alas, what's a creator to do? Well, if you aren't particularly worried about realism, you can dress them in something that kind of looks like armor, but is designed to show off the wearer's skin and secondary sex characteristics with seemingly no concern for safety or defensive usefulness.\nFor females, the full-blown version looks like a bikini bathing suit\u2014albeit one made of some armor-like material such as metal or leather\u2014that leaves the whole body naked and exposed to danger except for those parts which cannot be shown on network TV: namely, the breasts, butt, and pubic areanote\u00a0And even then, they can push the envelope with things like Underboobs and Thong of Shielding. Even if the skimpiness isn't that extreme, there will usually be skin showing at the neckline, shoulders, midriff, or thighs. They don't seem worried about being Exposed to the Elements, or that someone might stab them in the belly or shoot an arrow at their sternum: the Cleavage Window in particular makes you wonder if they're trying to get shot there. Additionally, armor materials that are stiff or bulky in real life will be implausibly stretchy and skin-hugging in drawing or animation, thus showing off the character's figure more.\nMost Writers Are Male may lead to instances where only females get the Chainmail Bikini treatment, while the guys are dressed in regular, non-sexualized armor. The creators' rationale may be that men need full armor to look menacing and professional (which may carry Unfortunate Implications that a male character can be liked by the audience purely because he's a great warrior, while a female warrior isn't worth including unless she also looks sexy), or that having Female Gaze fanservice in addition to the Male Gaze is unnecessary because the show is only catering to a straight male target audience. One of the most notorious and oft-parodied uses of this trope is in RPG videogames, where a suit of armor will look conventional on a male character, but will somehow morph into metal lingerie the moment a woman puts it on, even if it's literally the same suit transferred from one party member to another. And of course protective ability isn't compromised even though half the material is missing.\nDespite the preceding paragraph, this trope does indeed have male examples, particularly when the goal is to portray male fighters as super-macho and/or 'uncivilized'. Barbarian Heroes and post-apocalyptic tribe members tend to be depicted as Walking Shirtless Scenes: you might add one big pauldron, a pair of forearm bracers, and an armored belt or loincloth, but nothing that would obscure those chiseled pecs and abs. At the downplayed end you can have an armor version of Sleeves Are for Wimps to show off their muscular arms. There is debate about whether half-naked male warriors in fiction are sexually objectified in the same way as female ones, or whether a heroic, muscular body is merely part of the power fantasy that the male audience is encouraged to vicariously live through. It does seem, however, that at least some male examples are intended as legit fanservice.\nThe question of how a character can stay protected while wearing this stuff can be answered with protective runes in the form of tribal warpaint or tattoos, their actual armor consisting of invisible Deflector Shields, a Healing Factor making armor moot, or the \"wearer\" simply being a Screaming Warrior with no sense of self-preservation. Another Hand Wave is the idea that the character comes from a hot climate or a culture where less clothing is worn, or that they're a Fragile Speedster who doesn't like to be burdened with a lot of armor. If Played for Laughs by The Loonie, it's usually \"justified\" by a distraction bonus. All of this is related to the idea that Armor Is Useless, or at least that there's little correlation between how useful it is and how much it visibly covers. However, skimpy armor can potentially be justified if it was designed in-universe mainly for ceremony or entertainment, such as in Gladiator Games.\nA downplayed feminine version is the so-called \"boobplate\", which is a breastplate that doesn't expose flesh but is shaped with individual breast cups. As sometimes depicted\u2014with deep cleavage and no room for padding\u2014this a dangerously impractical design. In combat the deep cleavage would transmit the impact of a heavy blow directly to the breastbone, potentially fracturing it and perhaps even killing the wearer. Less extreme examples limit this danger as long as there is enough space and/or padding, since plate armor is very tough even without a glancing shape. Men in history have worn decorative armors with similar \"shot traps\" and it's been proposed that the real reason there are no historical examples of \"boobplate\" is that there were nowhere near enough women buying bespoke armors for themselves that a new style would be created for them; most women who donned armor had to make do with whatever they could get their hands on, and the very few professional women-at-arms who purchased bespoke armor had no reason to request a new template.\nA mainstay of Speculative Fiction. Form-Fitting Wardrobe is the Super Trope for this. See Thong of Shielding, Stripperiffic, Fanservice, Bare Your Midriff, Cleavage Window, Nubile Savage. There is a Web Comic by the same name, which naturally features one. Almost the exact opposite of 24-Hour Armor and Battle Ballgown. Not much of a concern, protection-wise, if Armor Is Useless. For people who fight completely naked see Full-Frontal Assault.\nPlease note when adding examples that scale armor and plate armor should not be called \"scale mail\" or \"plate mail\"note\u00a0not to be confused with the legitimate terms \"plated mail\" and \"mail-and-plate\" armor, referring to armor with pieces of plate integrated into a mail weave by rings passing through holes punched in the edges of the plate; This is a mistake introduced by 19th century scholars when they misused the term \"mail\" (or \"maille\") \u2014 which properly refers only to armor of interlocking iron rings \u2014 as a generic term for any kind of armor, making up compound words like \"scale mail\" to refer to specific types of armor. As a result of this misuse, they had to invent the term \"chainmail\" for when they needed to refer to the only kind of armor that was originally called \"mail\". The term \"chainmail\" is still used today (and in this trope's name) even though it is technically redundantnote\u00a0and to be fair, the Japanese language at least uses the word \"chain\" in it's term for mail: kusari gusoku literally means \"chain armor\", but \"plate mail\" and the like are just plain wrong. With that being said, you can be excused for using \"plate mail\" and other terms without a real-life basis when they're the canonical names of certain items in the game world or rulebook, such as in Dungeons & Dragons; it's not really your fault if the creators themselves made a mistake in terminology.\n"}
{"TalkingToAnimals": "A character can talk to animals, and they (mostly) answer as if they, too, were human.\nIn the prototypical version, which usually ends up being the main character and the focus of the show, this means having full-on conversations with them, rendered in English via the Translation Convention. Most of the time we will, at some point, be shown the Translation Convention explicitly by showing the character making, say, squirrel sounds back and forth with a squirrel. Oddly, he or she can also converse verbally with animals that don't use vocal communication at all.\nNote that this makes every animal in the world qualify as a Speech-Impaired Animal of sorts, since they're all at least intelligent enough to use a language. This makes carnivorousness morally sketchy for both animals and humans. Don't expect this to be addressed one bit. (Imagine what would happen if one of these characters ended up in a slaughterhouse!) Not only can someone who speaks Animal talk to every kind of animal, but every kind of animal usually seems to speak the same Animal Talk too.\nIt seems as if the presence of someone who speaks Animal heightens an animal's intelligence. They will verbally express an understanding of human actions that the animal's own actions up to then gave no indication of.\nThe ability to talk to animals is also a common superpower. In the early days, it was fairly common, but due to the perceived lameness of Aquaman-style \"talking to fish\", it's now most often given to the Super Team's Wacky Guy or Plucky Comic Relief as a sort of joke power. It's more useful when you can command the animals you communicate with; sometimes, the communication part is left out, and they can only really command animals to do things, rather than actually converse with them. This tends to avoid the problems mentioned above, in that you might be able to assume the animals are simply being compelled to carry out the commands by whatever magic or Applied Phlebotinum gave the character the powers in the first place. Sometimes a character can make both work for them.\nSpeaking of which, unrelated shows with lots of magic or Applied Phlebotinum running around can sometimes result in a device that can replicate these kinds of effects for a one episode story.\nThis is Level 5 on the Sliding Scale of Animal Communication.\nDon't confuse this ability with Talking Animal, which is when an animal can speak a human language. Also, note that if you shapeshift into an animal or a Beast Man, you'll usually learn how to speak Animal Talk too. See also Animal Eye Spy, where the character can see through the eyes of an animal. Compare Suddenly Fluent in Gibberish which is an ability to speak gibberish or some other made up language. A character with this ability is often a Friend to All Living Things.\n"}
{"TheSwordThatSpeaks": "A weapon\u2014usually a Cool Sword\u2014that talks. Some combination of Empathic Weapon, Evil Weapon, and Exposition Fairy may apply.\nIt might get annoying, though. If the weapon won't shut up, the wielder may feel Blessed with Suck. If the weapon can do more than just talk, see Equippable Ally.\n"}
{"NobleWolves": "As wolves became less common in inhabited areas, people became less wary and more curious of them and started to look at their positive traits. No longer seen as simply destructive beasts, they were soon written as proud and admirable symbols of nature that were intelligent, dignified and reasonable. Though still dangerous, if a Noble Wolf is antagonistic, it's probably not just because it hates you or wants to eat you. Rather, an antagonist Noble Wolf will probably have been offended at your trespasses or your competition for resources.\nThough leaning more towards neutrality, a Noble Wolf can easily be a heroic figure. With their intelligence, a doglike figure and social nature, it is easy to pick out good traits to emphasize. Having a lupine ally or pet instantly makes any character much more threatening or impressive. Any heroic wolf of this sort will be a force to be reckoned with as wolves are still taken very seriously today. Bonus points if the wolf is white.\nA Sister Trope to Heroic Dog. See also Heroic Dolphin. Compare and contrast Savage Wolves. This trope as it pertains to positive traits of male wolves is the origin of Papa Wolf.\n"}
{"ActionFilmQuietdramaScene": "What can make a great action film truly great? You might remember some exciting fight, spectacular pyrotechnics or awesome special effects, but they are not enough. Ironically, what really makes the difference is how good the film is at its quietest drama.\nIn this kind of scene, there are no expensive visuals or frenetic action, just usually two characters talking about what they believe in, what they care about, their deepest pains, or anything that relates to the stakes of the situation. In these scenes, the film artists are on their own to make them work without the technicians' help and that's where the talent must show through. This is not the same as the purely exposition scene in that there is something deeper displayed here.\nIn those scenes, you can understand the plot, grasp its theme, or develop a rapport with the characters to make the big scenes matter to you. If the crew can pull off such a scene well to complement the visuals, then it confirms the greatness of the film while the visuals become a nice bonus.\nWhen it really works, it can produce a Heartwarming Moment to make the action sequences all the more compelling because the quiet scenes have allowed you to emotionally invest in the characters and care about their fate.\nWhen that happens, it beats big budget visuals any day.\nWhen it doesn't work, Narm tends to follow. It also can result in a jarring case of Mood Whiplash.\nOften goes hand-in-hand with No, Mr. Bond, I Expect You to Dine. See also Just Here for Godzilla, where the audience still just wants the action scenes no matter how well done the drama is.\nSuper Trope of After Action Patchup, Nonviolent Initial Confrontation, and Pre-Battle Banter.\n"}
{"RatsInABox": "A special corollary of the Exasperated Perp. You've got three or more perps, all friends, relatives, or otherwise closely connected with each other, and none of them are talking. You know one or more of them committed the crime, but you've tried all the known (legal) tricks to get them to confess with no result. Solution: put the perps in one room, and let them stew in each other's presence until one or more of them snap. Sometimes it leads to a confession, usually it leads to the perps being worked up enough to finally respond to one last go-around in the interrogation room. Naturally, the detectives and security are always hanging just outside to intervene in case the shouting match that usually ensues in these kinds of situations leads to a physical confrontation between perps.\nTrope named after an experiment that states if you leave a population of rats to stew and propagate inside a small box, eventually the rats will turn on each other for food and room.\nThis trope is the exact opposite of the classic \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" where you keep the prisoners apart and offer each one a reduced sentence if he rats out the other(s). You make sure each one knows that his friends have received the same offer. It only takes one to break and the other(s) go down for life, but if I decide to talk first....\nOccasionally it turns out that they were all playing More Hero Than Thou and are all innocent but trying to protect the others, whom, like the police, they believe to be guilty.\n"}
{"DiabolicalMasterMind": "The criminal version of the Evil Overlord. Standing out from the terrorists, smugglers, murderers, gangsters, evil dictators and other petty criminals is the diabolical mastermind. Generally found sitting in an expensive leather chair with one hand idly tapping a Trap Door button and the other stroking his pet cat, the diabolical mastermind is always at the top of whatever criminal food chain the hero \u2014 usually a detective or spy \u2014 ends up climbing. He differs from the Evil Overlord in that he (usually) has no sovereign territory or political power of his own, although his criminal resources sometimes rival those of a developed nation.\nBecause of this, he (and it is almost always a he) is generally protected by dozens of mooks and sometimes The Dragon. As such, he is very rarely made to pay for his crimes.\nThe diabolical mastermind's motto is that you have to spend money to make money. As such, he may spend countless millions\u2014or billions\u2014of dollars building a super orbital Death Ray operated from a secret volcano base, only to then hold the world's governments to ransom for even more money. Since money is no object, the best way to ask the world for this ransom is to take over every TV channel or network in the world.\nNote that the diabolical mastermind is not always motivated by money. He may lust for power, land, priceless art or something else. But his tactics are invariably complicated and technologically impressive.\nTypically, the diabolical mastermind holds no political affiliation, nor does he follow anyone else's orders. As far as he is concerned, his is the only opinion that matters and everyone else will follow his lead. He fights for no cause except his own. Any affiliations with political parties or rebel fighters are purely for the purposes of hiding his connections with crimes or having others do his dirty work. This is not to say he has no political views or agenda, just that they are either kept separate from \u2014 or are the same as \u2014 his own personal ambitions.\nOf course, the diabolical mastermind isn't upset about getting his hands dirty if needed, although if he manages to capture the hero, he inevitably makes the mistake of pulling The Blofeld Ploy or favouring a deathtrap rather than just shooting the guy in the head. He is often a Bad Boss and his henchmen fear those ominous words: \"You Have Failed Me for the last time...\"\nIn politics, this character would resurface as the Shadow Dictator. Quite frequently is The Faceless (\"next time, Gadget!\") and a Badass Normal.\n"}
{"PrisonDimension": "The Prison Dimension is Exactly What It Says on the Tin: Another Dimension that is largely used for the sole purpose of imprisoning someone or something.\nHas shades of Pocket Dimension and Tailor-Made Prison. See also Phantom Zone.\n"}
{"Nerdgasm": "For some reason, geeks like to make jokes that geeks actually have sexual arousal about their geek interests. Not sex or fetishes, this is about the latest technology or something like that. Basically, it's the geek factor that is turning them on. If the thought of Wonder Woman fighting Storm turns someone on because it would be an awesome comic, and not because it's two hot chicks fighting, you have this trope.\nJust one of the many ways TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life.

Both are about supernatural settings where one character is set apart by preferring the mundane, whether by choice or ignorance - but it is still much closer related to Nay-Theist: Both Flat-Earth Atheist and Nay-Theist refuse to believe/worship, while someone who Does Not Like Magic just thinks it is bad, evil or dangerous.\nCommon in magical settings among Church Militants.

{"HospitalParadiso": "A character who works in some career with a focus on helping people (doctor, lawyer, clown) will get the opportunity to work in a veritable Eden. It's a beautifully decorated, spacious, and spotlessly clean hospital/lawfirm/circus equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, and servicing an exclusive clientele. The working conditions are excellent and the pay is even better. The boss is charming, and he's seriously interested in offering our physician hero a job.\nHe'll never take it, of course. Not just because Status Quo Is God, but because the job wouldn't be \"real medicine/law/clowning\". It isn't really Eden but a temptation that would lead him into job satisfaction hell. The character will state that he's only interested in helping the genuinely needy people who stagger into the ugly, barely-functional shack he works in, rather than the affluent clientele who already have ample options and opportunity for decent health care. That's why he went to medical school/law school/clown college in the first place. Such a statement may just be a return to form after this temporary temptation, the question of moving elsewhere only appearing for an episode or two. On the other hand, it could be the \"World of Cardboard\" Speech coming after a long period of confusion, where the appearance of Hospital Paradiso provides a clear dichotomy in his path and makes him realize his real desires.\nCompare Limited Advancement Opportunities.\n"}

They are likely to come in sets, with multiple worlds for various elements or concepts. The four classical elements are the likeliest to get such planes, but this is by no means an exclusive rule.\nCompare Elemental Nation, for when it's a society rather than a physical place that embodies and element or concept, which may still be an example.

{"EvilForeigner": "The Foreign Wrestling Heel, a.k.a. Evil Foreigner, is one of the major stock characters of Professional Wrestling. He's from another country, and loves his own country and hates America. Usually, the reason for this is because Americans (and American wrestling fans specifically) lack something that his country has in spades (or so he believes). For example, Brits and Frenchmen may look down on Americans because they lack class and sophistication; Japanese, because Americans lack honor; and Canadians, because Americans lack respect for wrestling tradition. These are the most common varieties of Foreign Wrestling Heel, but far from the only ones; one particular instance, Ludvig Borga, was an evil Finn who hated Americans because he felt Americans lacked respect for the environment.\nA Foreign Wrestling Heel will often feud with an All-American Face; the typical climactic match to this feud is a Flag Match, where the flags of the two nations of the participants are placed upon opposite turnbuckles, and the winner is the first man to recover his own flag and wave it. Clashes with the Foreign Wrestling Heel generally cause International Showdowns by Proxy like this, as he is usually the villain in those situations.\nDuring the Cold War, many (perhaps most) Foreign Wrestling Heels were Soviets, and spoke proudly of Communism and Glorious Mother Russia. It was difficult to find a wrestling promotion that didn't have an Evil Russian or three kicking around. Perhaps the best known of these was Nikita Koloff, and he also became the biggest subversion of the trope; when his arch-nemesis, Magnum T. A., suffered a career-ending injury in a car accident, Nikita decided Magnum was a Worthy Opponent, gained a new found respect for him, and all Americans by extension, and dedicated the remainder of his wrestling career to his fallen foe; he thus became the first Russian face and did so without renouncing Communism or the Soviet Union.\nNote that it is possible to be foreign and not a Foreign Wrestling Heel; however, the instant one shows any pride in being from a country that is not the US, he starts down the path to becoming one. Canada's Bret Hart, for example, wrestled most of his career as a face with his Canadian-ness being treated as an afterthought (unlike, say, the obviously Canadian heel The Mountie), until his 1997 heel turn, when he became proudly Canadian and launched a feud with all American fans and wrestlers. This led to him being a hated heel in in the States, but unsurprisingly led to his becoming loved even more by Canadian fans. Also, it's not necessary for the Foreign Wrestling Heel to be an actual foreigner. Simply looking foreign or having foreign ancestry is often enough for a wrestler to be given a Foreign Wrestling Heel gimmick (don't think too hard about this when it comes to American wrestling).\nLest the gentle reader think this is solely a gimmick for culturally insensitive Americans, consider the team of Art Barr, Eddie Guerrero, and Louie \"Madonna's Boyfriend\" Spiccoli, who wrestled as Los Gringos Locos in Mexican federation AAA, and were Evil American Foreigners. Likewise, many Japanese promotions have had their fair share of evil foreigners, All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling using them extensively for the first ten years of its existence, especially women from the USA based WWWA and AGWA.\nIf a Foreign Wrestling Heel is particularly hated by the crowd, listen for them to chant of \"USA! USA! USA!\", even if his opponents that evening aren't Americans. If a Foreign Wrestling Heel's one and only heelish trait is his foreignness and non-American patriotism, he may end up popular in the nation he supposedly hails from, and even get temporarily treated as a face if his promotion does a show in his alleged home country.\n"}
{"MotherMakesYouKing": "This is basically when someone could not have otherwise become king without their mother's efforts. It doesn't have to necessarily be a king\u2014it can refer to any situation where your mother makes sure you have power.\nIt could be that your mother is a political actor in her own right who plans to get you into power, scheming and murdering all other heirs and finally you become king. A woman in such a society can't be head of state, so her son becoming king is the next best thing. In that case, she's likely the Woman Behind the Man, and her son, once he's in power, may be a Puppet King.\nFor gender reasons (Heir Club for Men), daughter variants are less common, but not unheard of\u2014many an ambitious mother paraded her beautiful young daughter before a king in hope she'd be picked as a Hot Consort. In that case, it sometimes becomes a three-generational plan: She gets her daughter made queen, and then her daughter has a son who will become king.\nMerely inheriting your throne via your mother's line doesn't count; your mother has to actively support you in assuming the position. (This usually means scheming.)\nWhile it doesn't actually have to be becoming king, that is the most common case. Historically, a king's father usually had to die before he could become king, but many kings' mothers were still alive and well during their reigns, often titled \"Queen Mother.\" In the Ottoman Empire, sultans tended to have royal harems with many concubines\u2014but they only had one mother. She was effectively their queen, the second most powerful person in the empire after the sultan himself, and bore the title \"Valide sultan.\"\nThe mothers in question tend to be villainous, often overlapping with Evil Matriarch and God Save Us from the Queen!. This is doubly true if the son in question is secretly illegitimate, or otherwise not the biological son of the late king, making him not the \"rightful heir\". If her son has half-brothers in line to the throne before him, she will certainly be a Wicked Stepmother to those stepsons.\nSubtrope to Vicariously Ambitious. The mom in question is (whether heroic, villainous, or any combination thereof) most likely an Almighty Mom. If she was married to a king, she may have been a Lady Macbeth as well.\n"}
{"TokenMiniMoe": "The Token Mini Moe is a young or young-looking member of a cast designed to appeal to one of two predominant demographics. The first is those who simply find the character absolutely adorable and/or endearing and feel protective towards him or her. The character allows this sort of fan to act as and live out the role as an idealized older brother or sister (or parent) cheering their little sister on and helping her achieve whatever goals the setting deems important. The second are the Lolicons / Shotacons, who take an erotic or romantic interest in the character. Needless to say, these two groups are often at each other's throats over the character.\nWhat defines a Token Mini Moe is a number of factors. First, they appear prepubescent, regardless of whether they are actually children or not. Why someone so much younger appearing is mixed in with a group of older looking people may be addressed, but it's just as likely that it will be noted and then the story will move on. In a harem series where they are used as a love interest, they will almost never be the main one and are frequently overshadowed, their arcs amounting to a Precocious Crush that is gently rebuffed. Since they are the Token Mini Moe, if there are other similarly young looking characters in the cast then it is probably not this trope.\nCompare Tagalong Kid and Kid-Appeal Character, who are kids designed to act as Audience Surrogates for younger viewers.\nIn anime, these characters have a tendency to be referred to as \"token loli\" and \"token shota\" (if they are a token), but these words still have Unfortunate Implications in some places, so please don't use them in this website. Hence, this page was renamed from Token Loli (that and the fact that, because of the definition shift, female examples of Kid-Appeal Character and Tagalong Kid are also referred to as token lolis).\n"}
{"OfTheWeek": "Writing for TV ain't easy\u2014 coming up with fresh plots on a weekly basis can be tough. Fortunately for writers, most shows follow the same basic format week-to-week, so they don't have to come up with radically different plots every seven days. One of the most popular show types is the \"Of The Week\" format, in which a core cast of Regular Characters deals with a new problem every week. This combines the stability of a template show with the possibility of new, exciting stories.\nMost of the time, the problem the cast encounters disappears by the end of the episode, never to be mentioned again. It's becoming increasingly common for a show to have an overreaching seasonal Story Arc as well, but writers of the past generally preferred to stay low on continuity; less continuity means it's easier to re-air the show in syndication.\nIn script terms, the One-Shot Character who comes in with a problem and disappears after is called a client.\n"}
{"MeeknessIsWeakness": "If the character is responsible and pacifistic it will lead to Beware the Nice Ones. Selflessness, on the other hand, is a flaw that will be punished, either by the other characters, the writers or both. This is usually portrayed as a woman being domestic (either by choice or society's expectation), maternal or just being kind-hearted. Maybe the good girl is picked on just because she is an easy target (like when she is the poor Designated Victim), or perhaps it is the writers' way of avoiding making her a Mary Sue.\nHer weakness might be her lack of individuality, having no thoughts besides how a woman's place is in the home (or interests that aren't domestic) and how she should stand by the man in her life. Or she's a woman who seems to have had nothing to do with her life so she figures that the one thing she can be good at is raising a child, so that's what she'll do, because how hard can it be?\nIt might be that the dependent wife or girlfriend is betrayed and abandoned or the strong independent woman succeeds where the sweetheart fails. She might grow into a stronger person and even have a loving, healthy relationship by the end of the story, but don't count on it. Basically the good girl image will be used as an excuse to be cold, cowardly or clingy. Subject to Unfortunate Implications, as if to suggest that it's true that Real Women Don't Wear Dresses or Nice Guys Finish Last. Contrast the Yamato Nadeshiko and the sit-com Housewife (who are domestic but strong) as well as the Mama Bear (who is strong and maternal) and The Chick (who is strong but kind-hearted). Compare No Good Deed Goes Unpunished, Being Good Sucks, Dogged Nice Guy, Break the Cutie, and The Ingenue.\n"}
{"BStory": "Two narrative threads\u2014or more\u2014are woven together; two cases are prosecuted, two murders investigated, and so on. This allows a simple narrative structure to feel as if it has more variety. It gives the audience a break from one line and something to do in terms of recalling the events of the alternate line. The two stories may be about similar subjects, or one may be the usual fare (investigations, prosecutions) interleaved with character development that gives a sense of a Story Arc. Crime shows or films often feature parallel stories whose heroes turn out to be Working the Same Case.\nJuggling two stories is common enough that writers frequently refer to the \"A Story\" and the \"B Story\". Three or more is quite a bit less common, at least in purely-episodic or limited-continuity shows.\nIf the B Story is clearly subservient to the A Story, it will usually be described as the \"subplot\". A common pattern on many series\u2014sitcoms in particular\u2014is that the same sets of characters will usually be segregated into \"main plot\" and \"subplot\" every week.\nIn arc-heavy fare, two or three recurring storylines may be hit along with one or two minor \"breather\" plotlines all at once. This just means less screen time for each plotline, which mean they all go on for more episodes, which means the viewers keep watching. This is common in Soaps, long-form dramas, and some Sci-Fi series.\nIf the A Story and B Story aren't juggled simultaneously, but are instead handled separately and tied together with an incredible chain of events, it's Halfway Plot Switch. If said chain of events is split over two time periods, it's Meanwhile, in the Future.... Often uses Plot Parallels to set up a Double Aesop.\nA lighter version involves the protagonist's investigation running parallel to something more innocent. While the detective mom investigates the grisly subway killings, her kids investigate the mystery of the missing pizza slice. This allows for a freeze-framed laugh at the end when it's discovered the dog did it.note\u00a0Ate the pizza, not butchered the commuters.\nFor a Soap Opera variation see Soap Wheel and Four Lines, All Waiting. Contrast Offstage Waiting Room. If one of the storylines seems utterly inconsequential compared to the other, you may have a case of Trapped by Mountain Lions. When a battle is starting in one storyline and the camera switches to another storyline, this is an example of a Charge-into-Combat Cut. See also Simultaneous Arcs, when the entirety of one arc is told before the next one gets told, but each one happens at the same time.\n"}
{"PervertRevengeMode": "Oh no! You've just had an Accidental Pervert moment and now a girl is after you! And not in a good way! You may have seen her naked, grabbed somewhere she doesn't like, or anything on a similar line. And now you are really in for it!\nCan result in an instant smack-down, or possibly a game of hide and seek where the hider is you and the seeker has a Hyperspace Mallet, Frying Pan of Doom, or some other implement.\nNot to be confused with the Unprovoked Pervert Payback, where a girl gets set to Pervert Revenge Mode for no apparent reason. Can be subverted if the man is known to be gay by the attacker, or is a girl in disguise, etc. Generally the result of Accidental Pervert, or the Covert Pervert (Who may actually deserve his comeuppance!). Even the Chivalrous Pervert may get battered occasionally. See also: Double Standard. A common tactic of the Tsundere.\n"}
{"WretchedHiveOfScumAndVillainy": "Take the worst or grimmest and darkest side of society, give them a place where all their sins are given free roam to be expressed, and collect it into a system that can just barely sustain itself and you get the Wretched Hive.\nIt will be a mostly lawless setting, usually (over) populated by criminals. There may be no actual government in this Wild West or Scavenger World because it is miles or light years away from civilization, and if there is it's probably a Dystopia that's corrupt, incompetent, obstructive or perhaps just uncaring enough to not bother to spread its reach to all corners of society. If this hive has any truly good authorities, expect them to be extremely overworked, incapable of controlling the skyrocketing crime everywhere, or just too idealistic to survive. An alternative is to have it as a gang-like system ruled by a mob boss, Big Bad or Evil Overlord who allows evil, but only to a certain standard. It could be truly lawless with no authority other than the big stick you carry with you.\nIn many cases, the economy is no better. If this is true, facilities are usually falling apart, and the subways and buses are often full of crooks and junkies. And they're always late. Any schools in this place will almost inevitably be impoverished or sadistic. The roads may be cracked and broken, with a Trashcan Bonfire ever fifty feet or so. Many buildings have been abandoned, to be occupied by vermin, hobos, or criminals. Decent jobs are few and far between. Housing (if you can get it) is unsafe, filthy, and overcrowded. In short, poverty is the norm, not the exception.\nHowever, prosperous and affluent settings can also qualify as this trope. While people are more likely to be in decent financial shape, don't expect things to be any better in terms of morality. At most, there's a pleasant fa\u00e7ade to conceal the rot within. Sleazy, immoral decadence is frequently rife, and may not even be particularly hidden \u2014 if it is at all. Non-impoverished examples are arguably worse, ethically and morally speaking, since the inhabitants don't have deprivation as an explanation for the things they do.\nThis lawless setting is often wonderful for allowing all varieties of creativity, ideas and/or tropes to flow in, be played and interact in interesting ways, and many plot conveniences that the protagonists need to get away with doing active work rather than just handing problems over to the police or running into Fridge Logic when they don't get arrested for taking the law into their own hands, while there are several takes on all sorts of unlawful or devious acts. Gangs, cons, gambling, underground fighting, rampant prostitution, a thriving black market (ranging from one guy with some watches under his coat to a literal market), jaywalking and many more. This can be portrayed as anything from guilty fun or the inevitable underbelly of humanity to constant danger. The heroes can always find some misdeed around them to solve and the villains will have little problem finding a safe hideout or Bad-Guy Bar to get together and plot schemes.\n\nThe Wretched Hive has a few Sub Tropes in increasing size:\nSee also Gangster Land, City Noir or Industrial Ghetto. When Real Life New York City is portrayed this way, it's The Big Rotten Apple. Has nothing to do with bees.\nOften paired with Crapsack World, but differs in that while the setting is less than ideal, the people in it need not be unhappy or universally sociopathic, nor is the worst result the most likely to happen.\nOpposite of the Sugar Bowl and Utopia in general, and Shining City more specifically.\n"}
{"ActiveRoyalty": "Note: If you were looking for a fanfic with the title Noblesse Oblige and found yourself here, try the fanfic namespace.\nDue to Everything's Better with Princesses, and other such tropes, there is a belief that being royalty means doing almost nothing else but, well, being royalty. Aside from all the pomp, ceremony, galas, balls, intrigue, and the occasional dealing with actual governing of the country, royalty just doesn't do anything else with their time. This has some Truth in Television, such as the court at Versailles or the Forbidden City in China, but not uniformly so.\nJust as often as not, royalty would actually do something worthwhile with their time. For centuries from prehistoric Mesopotamia through to the Middle Ages, kings were expected to be strong warriors, defend their holdings, and inspire the people around them. In fact, \"strong man who can lead the other men of the village in fighting off enemies\" was probably the original meaning of kingship. Three examples are Alexander the Great, Charlemagne, and Genghis Khan, kings who gained and kept their power through their skill as generals and warriors and, in the case of the latter two, administrators. note\u00a0Sadly, there are many royals who conspired against their people in their free time. This in turn gave them greater power, so an incentive to carry that out, as well. Many of the nouveau riche, for instance, were generals and warriors who started wearing crowns and intermarrying, while taking out their competition.\nThis convention also led to the establishment of the feudal system. It was actually a deal between the king, nobles, and serfs. The serfs would work on the land owned by their lords, and the lords would train to be warriors (aka, knights), who would defend the kingdom against invaders, like the Vikings. note\u00a0It was only after the protection part was dropped by the lords that serfdom became no different from slavery. And we know how well that turned out.\nEither way, being royalty does not necessarily mean a life of leisure or boredom. And fiction occasionally nods to this.\nNote that this trope means that the person is still acting as royalty, just doing other things. So a Rebellious Princess does not count, since she is running away from that kind of life. King Incognito may count, if the king is attempting to learn things to influence how he reigns; to do it for fun, even if it proves educational, does not count.\nIt should also be noted that much of the \"activities\" done by royalty (charity events, sport, arts, etc.) are enabled by their being part of the idle rich, instead of having to work for a living. Also, especially in the case of charity events and good causes, this is often a calculated public relations maneuver, which is not to say that it makes the activities any less of a good impact, there are simply multiple reasons for said activities.\nThe French have a phrase for this: noblesse oblige (lit. \"nobility obligates\"). It means that the nobility should fulfill the responsibilities of their position.\nEspecially prone to What's Up, King Dude?. See also In Its Hour of Need.\nA Super Trope to Warrior Prince, Pretty Princess Powerhouse, Politically Active Princess.\nCompare Modest Royalty, Authority Equals Asskicking, Non-Idle Rich.\nContrast Idle Rich, The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, Authority in Name Only, Orcus on His Throne, Adipose Rex.\nThis trope is very much Truth in Television, so any Real Life examples are redundant.\n"}
{"FictionalVideogame": "An original Video Game or Pinball machine described through a work of narrative fiction.\nIf described in detail, the game may avert Pac-Man Fever.

{"MasterofUnlocking": "In certain video games, the humble Locked Door is among the most complex devices the Player Character is likely to encounter, requiring years of specialised training to comprehend its intricate workings. Faced with this diabolical machinery, a lesser man will turn and run in terror, their mission forever incomplete. But one of the NPCs with you has no such fears; their senses have been dulled to the terror before them. They step forward boldly. Maybe they deliver a sharp kick or shoulder barge. Maybe they pull out some lockpicks, a door-opening computerised contraption, or an explosive charge. Regardless, once they've worked their magic, the dastardly door lies forever defeated, the way forward clear.\nYou've just witnessed a Master of Unlocking at work.\nTypically, the Master of Unlocking is a plot contrivance to explain why only certain doors can be opened, since only the master can correctly determine which doors are vulnerable to their awe-inspiring skills; that, or the developers are trying to make NPCs appear useful without having them actually do anything. It's also used to avoid Interchangeable Antimatter Keys. If a player character is Master of Unlocking in a game with more than one PC, it's probably to allow them into areas the others can't go. If they're the only character, their skill with certain doors is likely to just be covering up loading the next room; either that, or some doors will be harder or riskier to open than others, but have bigger rewards.\nIn a movie, a character whose skill with lockpicks or doors is noted is likely to have Chekhov's Skill or Chekhov's Hobby, with their talent being useful in a specific situation or bought up in a stressful one.\nRelated to Plot Coupon; one might be required before the Master of Unlocking can get to work, such as a set of picks or a passcard for their decoding device. Often related to Law of Conservation of Detail if the Master is an NPC; it means the pesky player won't try to open all those doors the developer didn't put anything behind. Utility Party Member is a more general variation of a Non-Player Companion who has several non-combat skills essential to advancing through the game.\n"}
{"PromIsForStraightKids": "Many gay teenagers, just like many straight teenagers, look forward to attending their high school prom. Unfortunately, some people don't like the idea of seeing two boys or two girls dancing together, and therefore attempt to prevent them from attending said prom together. Alternatively, the gay characters themselves might not want to draw attention to themselves. This may result in outrage from their friends and/or family and some sort of happy resolution.\nTruth in Television for many, unfortunately, and some schools outright ban gay and lesbian couples from prom.\n"}
{"ToylessToylineCharacter": "In Merchandise-Driven media it's typically pretty easy to set apart the characters whose toys are getting advertised. They're the ones that take the spotlight in any given story, save the day in the end, etc., or are otherwise just made to look cool by the narrative itself. They'll have more character development, more detail in their character model, more gadgets; everything about them screams toyetic in loud plastic-mould colors.\nBut not this character. This is the Ensemble Dark Horse of the toyline-driven media, that bursts into the scene like a Highly Visible Ninja with a rocket launcher and a banner reading, \"Buy all our playsets and toys\" only, after rushing to the toy store, mouth drooling and brow sweaty, you find out he doesn't have his own toy. Often they'll be The Ace, appearing for a brief storyline, showing up everyone else, and then never seen again\u2014not in the story and never in the toy aisles.\nMost of the time for a Merchandise-Driven franchise the toys are either (a) designed first and the show/comic makers make a story around the characters, or (b) the toy makers and show makers work together, so everyone else is likely to be a Flat Character, or even No Name Given. Often there are actual limits set to how much attention can be given to these characters; a non-toy character that's not just a Tag Along Kid being allowed to be prominent is next to unheard of.\nIt seems bizarre and even out-of-place\u2014which is not to say unwelcome\u2014when an original character does become important. They're not always recurring characters but they sometimes get more development and attention than characters that actually had toys, because there's usually Loads and Loads of Characters.\nWhy this happens varies, sometimes a writer that's been banging his shackles against the wall long enough manages to loosen them enough to get creative and inject a character into the story for the character's own sake. Sometimes a Monster of the Week winds up getting a little more attention than usual and starts looking toyetic.\nIn a boys' show, generally the Tag Along Kid, the armies of mooks, and in older series, the Token Girl will need to be created for the show, and in a girls' show it's the same for the villains in general.\nThis is not just any character who doesn't appear in his story's toyline. Also note that with many long-running franchises, sometimes toys will be made of these characters and marketed to collectors. The point isn't that no toy exists, but that when the media was made, the character wasn't being used to advertise one.\nIf a major female character from a Merchandise-Driven series ends up as a Toyless Toyline Character, it's probably because of The Smurfette Principle.\nSee also Sir Not-Appearing-in-This-Trailer.\nExamples are sorted by where the character appeared. Franchises spanning more than one media category, like Transformers and G.I. Joe, have more than one entry.\nCompare Canon Foreigner.\n"}
{"OneNoteChef": "A character \u2014 frequently male \u2014 who is only able to make one specific kind of food, often because they're a Lethal Chef and attempts to diversify their efforts would end in disaster. Through harsh training, they have finally become able to make one thing that is edible, at least. If it's their Trademark Favorite Food, they're in luck. Sometimes their specialty dish is widely praised as being transcendentally delicious... they just can't transfer that skill to anything else.\nSometimes Truth in Television \u2014 it's relatively common for people who aren't particularly good at cooking (even if they're not quite at Lethal Chef levels) to be able to make a few dishes fairly well. This trope lies somewhere between Supreme Chef and Lethal Chef. Also see Crippling Overspecialization for other non-culinary examples.\n"}
{"LoadsAndLoadsOfSidequests": "\n\n\n\n\nWhen a video game contains a truly baffling number of Sidequests and other odd jobs. Many games thrive on replay value, and so with more stuff to do in more varieties of ways, a game in theory, gains more replay value and thus general value.\nOften it's a wonder the Player Character has time to do them all with the world about to end/be taken over/succumb to darkness/all that generally not nice stuff.\nWestern RPGs in general tend to have a relatively short 'main' questline, with the majority of content being in the form of sidequests. Depending on how the difficulty/balancing works, it will often be expected that the player spend some time on side missions between parts of the plot in order to earn new abilities and equipment before pushing on to harder areas.\nGames that feature this generally fall towards the open end of the Sliding Scale of Linearity vs. Openness. Compare Sidetracked by the Gold Saucer, where a particular sidequest is so good and addictive it might distract one from the main quest altogheter, as well as Quicksand Box, when the sidequests are so expansive one gets confused on what one should actually be doing.

A common form of the Robeast.\n"}
{"ExpansionPack": "Extra material produced for an existing game, either by the game's original production company or by a third party. Expansion packs generally provide a new story line, more levels or maps and occasionally new items, equipment or units.\nWhat makes an expansion different from a new game or a stand-alone game or even a sequel is that you usually need to have the original game installed to play it. The expansion contains more data for the game and does not have a game engine of its own, and it usually doesn't come with the original game. Although recently, a few companies have been releasing standalone expansion packs, which do in fact come with the engine, and allow the gamer to play with the extra content by itself, but having the original game too may have benefits (such as an Old Save Bonus allowing you to pick up with your endgame character, and avoid bag-spillage).\nThere has been some recent controversy over the fact that additional purchasable content on some recent games actually consists of unlocking material which shipped with the original game. While this practice is not exactly fraudulent, and has been employed for productivity software for years (for a recent and commonplace example, Windows Vista's five or so versions are all included on every disc, and the license key determines which features will be enabled), some gamers have felt cheated by being compelled to pay extra for content they already physically possessed.\nThis is not a new phenomenon. It is said that back in the 1970s, IBM would sell a low-end version of its original 360 mainframe, that if the customer ordered a higher-end version (which cost several thousand dollars for the upgrade), IBM would send out a technician who simply used a clipper to sever one wire. The technicians, of course, were told to behave as if this was a complicated procedure.\nNearly every RTS game ever made had at least one expansion pack. While the older games usually just added bonus missions that were more challenging than the original game, it has become custom to expand the different factions' unit lineup as well as frequently adding new factions to the game altogether.\nMMORPGs used to rely heavily on this model and the biggest titles with physical editions still do, either as the sole method of distribution or as an option for those with poor internet connections. Free To Play titles deliver most of their content updates online but may occasionally bundle several patches together on a disc in an example of this trope.\nNot to be confused with third party self-titled add-ons, which usually just contain maps made with the games map editor (and usually not very advanced either). Third-party add-ons are often (though not always) produced by a game's fan community, and can take the form of extended (or heavily-revised) storylines, additional missions, new weapons, or a 'Total Conversion', which is a time-intensive process that (as the name suggests) converts the game into something else entirely, and usually involves a graphical overhaul, a new soundtrack, and even (in the most extreme cases) new model design and programming extensions (some of which push the game's original engine far beyond its design limitations).\nRelated to Downloadable Content, which, depending on what and how much they add to their base games, are basically downloaded Expansion Packs. See Mission-Pack Sequel for when developers try to pass these off as entirely new games. (Expansion packs have sometimes been retooled as mission-pack sequels because publishers would rather have stand-alone games to sell to a wider audience, or because the hardware on a particular platform isn't conducive to physically separating the Game Engine from the scenario data.)\nThese aren't just for video games either; Board Games, and Euro Games in particular, are noted for having a lot of them. See also Source Book.\n"}
{"Soul": "Showing up in The '50s and The '60s, soul was developed by African-American musicians by combining elements of Gospel Music and Rhythm and Blues. The result was something that sounded a lot like Gospel but (usually) without the religious themes.\nIn the heyday of soul\u2014starting in the late 1950s and running through the 1960s\u2014it was initially divided into two camps: Northern and Southern. Southern soul, whose flagship studio was Stax Records in Memphis, was noted for a rougher sound and harder-edged lyrics, and was mostly marketed towards Black audiences. Northern soul, whose flagship studio was Motown Records in, erm, Motown, was noted for a softer, poppier sound with more \"family-friendly\" lyrics and elaborate orchestrations, and was specifically engineered by studio head Berry Gordynote\u00a0Fun fact: His son and grandson formed LMFAO, which couldn't be more different to have crossover appeal to White audiences. Around the same time, other soul scenes percolated in New York (based around Atlantic Records, the premier rhythm and blues label in America, which had previously recorded and published Ray Charles, was home to Solomon Burke throughout the 1960s, and served as national distributor for Stax Records for most of the decade) and Chicago (a halfway house between Motown, Memphis and New York both musically and geographically, and largely centred around the songwriting and production of the Impressions' lead vocalist Curtis Mayfield).\nDespite the differences - and the commercial rivalry between Stax and Motown - there was a definite sense they were one style, with a lot of cross-pollination. This soul - the \"classic\" soul sound of the 1960s - was the soundtrack of the Civil Rights Movement, and everything associated with \"good\" and authentic Black culture was called \"soul\" something by analogy (most famously, the term soul food stuck for referring to traditional Black American cuisine). Later, in the mid-to-late 60s and into the 70s, a third soul \"sound\" appeared when some artists in Philadelphia, most famously the songwriting and production duo of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, began incorporating elements of Funk, Big Band Jazz and Motown-style orchestration to produce the sweet-sounding variant called \"Philadelphia Soul\", a.k.a. \"Sweet Philly,\" which in retrospect was probably one of the strongest influences on the nascent Disco (listen to some Philly soul and you'll probably remark how incredibly 70s it sounds).\nSoul had a powerful effect on both Rock & Roll and modern Pop, and was the leading form of music for African-Americans until Funk music (itself heavily influenced by soul, and pioneered by leading R&B artists like James Brown and Isaac Hayes) came onto the scene in the early Seventies. Soul kept on; it eventually became nigh-indistinguishable from its forbear R&B (Rhythm and Blues) as, in the face of the rise of Hip-Hop, the term started to be used for \"any music made for and by black people that still has melodic singing.\" Purists cringed, of course, but alas, there was nothing to be done.\nEvery now and then, soul makes some kind of resurgence, variously disguised as (for example) New Jack Swing in the 1990s and neo-soul in the 2000s.\nSoul or soul-styled music performed by white artists is generally called \"blue-eyed soul\". The British are the most likely to try a soul-influenced sound: David Bowie broke into the American market after he switched from glam rock to soul (with the New Sound Album Young Americans, recorded in Philadelphia), and two of the biggest soul acts of the past decade are Amy Winehouse and Adele, both as English as they come. The term \"plastic soul\" is used pejoratively to describe soul-styled music that replicates the sound and characteristics of soul music, but without its innate meaning (which prompted The Beatles to name their next album Rubber Soul, 'cos, wouldn't you know it, they were high at the time and thought that was funny).\nBritain is strongly associated with the mod-oriented northern soul scene of the 1960s and early 1970s, which grew out of the dance clubs in cities like Manchester and Wigan and was sustained by DJs who specialized in tracking down extremely rare soul tracks from obscure labels which never quite gained mainstream popularity. Many British pop stars who kicked off their careers at the onset of the 1980s, including Elvis Costello, Madness, The Specials, Dexys Midnight Runners (who took their name from a popular northern soul mod amphetamine which gave its users the energy to dance all night) and many, many more were active participants in or admirers of the northern soul movement. Pete Waterman, famously one third of the Stock-Aitken-Waterman production team (the \"Hit Factory\") whose Hi-NRG and synthpop productions provided the sound of British pop music in the late 1980s and early 1990s, began his musical career as one of the top northern soul DJs (alongside fellow Hi-NRG producer/songwriter Ian Levine) in the 1970s.\nSoul also stayed popular in an unusual space. A mix of all styles survives in North and South Carolina as 'Beach Music' where soul music style with a lindy-hop-style dance called 'The Shag' (no, not the British meaning) started in the 1940s with early R&B and settled into its modern form in the 1980s with music from the Dominoes, the Drifters, the Clovers, the Tams, the Tymes, the Temptations, the Four Tops, and the Chairmen of the Board, along with local acts like The Swinging Medallions, The Okaysions, The Catalinas, and The Embers. The epicenter of this is Myrtle Beach, on the NC/SC border. As Soul faded from popularity in mainstream popular music, Beach Music kept many acts alive and earning money right through to today. The very early days of Beach Music were critical in getting southern white audiences to accept what was then called 'race' records.\nNot uprising, as the Internet took off, there has been some heavy cross-pollination between Beach Music and Britain's Northern Soul crowd.\nSoul Train started (predictably enough) presenting soul acts on television, \u00e0 la American Bandstand. As the black community's tastes in music changed, Soul Train changed its tune a bit (and at some point became inextricably \u2014 and rather embarrassingly \u2014 linked with Disco), but the roots were still fairly obvious down to the end.\nPlease do not confuse with the Discworld novel.\n"}
{"PostDramaticStressDisorder": "A character, despite long odds does something awesomely cool. Maybe they get a Heroic Second Wind that lets them survive long enough for the bad guy to give up and leave them alone, or maybe they just won a particularly difficult fight that they didn't think they could win.\nBut, after the character's sure the danger has passed, he promptly collapses, whether from the stress of dealing with someone who completely terrified him, because he overtaxed his power too much, or just because he got hurt too badly in the fight. If he actually succumbs to his injuries and dies, it becomes a Heroic Sacrifice. Less serious injuries may start the action back up with an After-Action Healing Drama.\nThis one is frequently used with the Doomed Moral Victor, Heroic Safe Mode or with I Can Still Fight!.\nSee also similar tropes Heroic RRoD and Power-Strain Blackout. Compare Fainting Seer.\nCommonly used so the author doesn't have to write about all the boring clean-up after the battle climax. The hero may last just long enough for The Cavalry Arrives Late, so they can do the clean-up. For more minor injuries, After Action Patchup may suffice to let him out of the work.\nMay result when the Bottled Heroic Resolve or Super Mode wears off. Often produces Deep Sleep.\nTruth in Television, to an extent: Adrenaline and other stress hormones can enable people to go for a long time, despite injuries, only to collapse once the danger is passed and the stress hormones wears off.\n"}
{"OurWitchesAreDifferent": "The historical Christian view of a \"witch\" was a person who makes a Deal with the Devil in exchange for magic powers, often defined as becoming Satan's concubine. On the other hand, adherents of modern Neo-Pagan religions such as Wicca naturally take an opposing viewpoint on the practice of witchcraft.\nIn the modern day, though, either the positive or negative connotations of magic-as-divinely-attained would result in controversy (perhaps due to the ease with which either one may be confused with the other). So, in much fiction, witchcraft has become more of a matter of Superpowerful Genetics. Either \"witch\" is merely a particular race of humanity, or a different species altogether (the distinction is usually a matter of the author's semantics rather than using an actual biological definition of \"species\", such as the absence of interbreeding). This is a bit closer to a belief among the Azande of Africa, that an inherited organ (often located near the liver) allows potential unconscious use of magic.\nA Witch Species is also mentioned in very early Christian writings describing a belief that witches were tiny creatures that cause sickness in plants, animals and people. In other words, germs. But these writings also dismissed this idea as a superstitious delusion.\nThe witch's powers are merely a physical trait which you either have or you don't, although those lucky enough to be born into a Witch Species may still have to work hard for their abilities to reach their full potential. They may even need formal Training.\nNote that these characters were originally almost Always Female, unless male relatives are introduced, and male magic-users generally use learned skills for their magic. In some cases, male witches (frequently called \"warlocks\") are exclusively evil. The popularity of Harry Potter, however, has brought in some boys, although they're sometimes referred to as wizards or warlocks. Complicating the issue of inheritance of witch powers is that Muggle parents may produce witch children (and witch parents' Muggle children) because the Witch Species traits manifest in Randomly Gifted individuals.\nMost protagonist Witches tend to be rookies, but the older and powerful ones are depicted as Physical Gods.\nIn Japan, the popularity of Magical Girls has considerably softened the idea and one is just as likely to see magic powers that are either genetic or learned.\nMay be the targets of Superhuman Trafficking. See also Cute Witch. For cases where every member of the witch species is a Wicked Witch (which is probably true if all Magic Is Evil), see Always Chaotic Evil. When members of a witch species produce a child with no powers, it's a Muggle Born of Mages.\nBy default, anyone from a Witch Species is disqualified from Badass Normal status (Muggle Born of Mages notwithstanding); they can still, however, fight like a normal, as well as be Brought Down to Badass.\n"}
{"EnlightenmentSuperpower": "Some heroes train non-stop to develop Charles Atlas Superpowers, often using Training from Hell to attain herculean feats of skill. But... will defeating a dojo full of ninjas while blindfolded and bound in chains reveal the meaning of suffering? How many miles have to be run over liquid magma without breaking the surface before the purpose of life unfolds?\nThe master of Enlightenment Superpowers knows.\nAfter years of spiritual introspection, countless hours of intellectual debate, searches both academic and personal, the mysteries of existence begin to unfold. A sudden revelation reveals the secrets of the universe in a flash of (divine?) lightning. It doesn't have to be tied to any one religion; it's entirely possible for the revelation to be fathomable by an atheist or secular character. Maybe it's all that meditating that unlocks the full use of the brain or makes it gain critical mass, giving practitioners Super Intelligence or Psychic Powers like: Astral Projection, access to past life memories and skills, levitation, and Aura Vision courtesy of their Third Eye chakra.\nPhysically, since All Monks Know Kung-Fu, their mental harmony and discipline means they can likely control their body's autonomic functions... possibly even unlocking Healing Factors, iron durability, incredible longevity, surpassing biological needs, Super Strength, and Ki Attacks.\nBecause Magic Is Mental, these two tropes often overlap: the best wizards are the wisest and the smartest.\nCharacters with Enlightenment Superpowers usually know some type of Functional Magic courtesy of their training, though it's entirely possible they can't cast any magic at all (or both sets of abilities are independent but related). To use a computer metaphor, their abilities don't come from using cosmic cheat codes, but thanks to discovering (or creating) the help file and user manual. Basically, they have learned to harness all of their human potential.\nInterestingly, not all characters with Enlightenment Superpowers are good. It's sometimes the case that they decide that Might Makes Right and as the strongest, they can do as they please or they develop a much weirder philosophy. Generally characters who achieve this enlightened state are highly grounded, hard to upset, and very moral. Still, Beware the Nice Ones, because they have a Meditation Powerup.\nCompare and contrast Power Born of Madness where the madness may or may not be considered enlightenment. Expect to see this overlap with Japanese Spirit a lot.\nDespite the name, has nothing whatsover to do with Romanticism Versus Enlightenment.\n"}
{"PointedEars": "What is it about pointy ears?\nFor some reason, the fastest, most reliable way to establish someone (or thing) is not human is to give them unusually pointy ears. Whether it be elves, aliens, or stranger fare, having those ears point skyward is all it takes to knock them down (or up) a peg.\nThe size, shape and length of the ears can vary, and this affects the nature of the species they're on. Normal ears with a slightly pointy tip? Probably a Human Alien or an elf, but might be a demon or even a vampire, so be on your guard. Long and tubular pointy ears that are a bit ratty? Then it's a filthy monster/mutant that is Always Chaotic Evil and must be purged with flame. Dog or cat-like ears that move, with tufts of fur? Probably a Beast Man or Wolf Man, back away slowly without making eye contact. Or perhaps long, gracefully arching ears? Then they're obviously elves or something far above mere human, and must be treated with respect and humility because they have all kinds of kickass magic and martial prowess.\nHere's a short list of these pointy-eared inhuman hobgoblins:\nA subtrope of Unusual Ears.\n"}
{"TheFonzie": "What's a writer to do when a minor character that they created for a show suddenly becomes much more popular than the other members of the cast? Why, re-write them as a main character of course!\nThis is that character. Usually starring in a sitcom, the breakout character quickly grabs hold of the audience's attention and writers take advantage of this energy. Someone who was once a one-note C-character (such as a Satellite Character or a Living Prop) becomes a central part of the regular cast. Often liable to lead to a Spin-Off, or be subject to becoming an Adaptational Badass. Sometimes a breakout character becomes such because they fill a niche in the cast that wasn't previously filled or acts as an impressive foil to the Hero.\nWhen a character gets a larger, but still supporting, role because of the fanbase, that is simply an Ensemble Dark Horse (which they also are even if they don't get any increased role). Ascended Extra is when a character gains any sort of increased role regardless of the character's popularity (or lack thereof). When a character simply takes over the existing show, see Spotlight-Stealing Squad.\nIt isn't always good though. Sometimes, if a breakout character gets too much screentime, they risk making the audience feel that the character is overexposed or worse, become a Scrappy or a Creator's Pet. Always remember that you still have other characters in the cast who need screentime too and just because one character is extremely popular doesn't mean that the others should always be Demoted to Extra. This pitfall can be avoided by occasionally giving breaks to the breakout character. Other characters can get their stories told and their fans will patiently wait for them to reappear in the story and be all the more excited when they do reappear.\nRelatedly, this can sometimes result from Executive Meddling, as opposed to the will of the writer/director; The Fonz himself, our poster boy, was an example, as his increasing prominence was inspired in part by executive pressure, and said execs even wanted to rename the show Fonzie's Happy Days at one point. Naturally, like a lot of executive decisions over creators, this can backfire spectacularly and cause a popular character to crater from over-exposure.\nTrying to intentionally make a breakout character before they're even introduced to audiences can also lead to some unfortunate results.\nAlso see Breakout Villain, a Sub-Trope for villain characters, and Iconic Sequel Character, a Sub-Trope for when the Breakout Character in question doesn't appear until a sequel. Compare to Breakup Breakout. Contrast The Artifact. No relation to Breakout.\nThe line between this and Ensemble Dark Horse can sometimes seem thin, and one may wonder why this isn't a YMMV trope when the latter is one. The key difference is this: the popularity of the character has to have influenced the direction of the narrative and put them into a major role, or led to the creation of new content specifically for them. That's what makes this a narrative and production trope; the influence of the character in the zeitgeist was so strong it actively, and quantitatively, influenced the production of the work. Otherwise, the character is just popular, which is often up for more debate in terms of degree, which is why Ensemble Darkhose is a YMMV trope.\n"}
{"ClashingCousins": "Cousins having a tense relationship is not unheard of. Often times this is the product of a Sibling Rivalry between their parents rubbing onto the children. Other times this has similar reasons to a Sibling Rivalry considering how close many cousins are (usually closer than other parts of the extended family). Or maybe they just don't like each other and their familial relationship cannot fix that. Either way, the cousins don't get along much of the time.\nCompare to Sibling Rivalry and in extreme cases Cain and Abel. Can often overlap with (or lead to) Feuding Families.\n"}
{"TheShowOfTheBooks": "A book series is adapted into a TV series. Not just a TV Movie, but a regular weekly series about the characters. Unless the book series is already a Long Runner, this is probably going to Overtake The Series quite quickly, and become its own Alternate Continuity. In fact, it may not even use the books as anything other than a source of characters.\nCompare The Film of the Book. Contrast Anime First.\n"}
{"TheBarber": "Back in some small towns in the old west, the barber was the only person who had experience handling a very sharp knife (and the association between barbers and surgeons goes back centuries.) The town might not be big enough to have a physician, so in addition to cutting your hair and shaving you, he might also do some \"minor\" surgeries, or any major ones where you either didn't have enough time to get to a real doctor, or would probably die from the rigors of the trip. Sometimes was also the mortician since he had to shave the corpses, too. This type of Barber might show up in a \"realist fantasy\" that has done the research.\nIn fictional Westerns however Barbers are used primarily as sources of gossip, and a local gathering place outside of the Saloon. Expect the villain to show up and demand a shave before he confronts The Hero, thus allowing the Barber to send a warning to The Sheriff. Occasionally can be reversed.\nBy ancient tradition, the Barber tends to be extremely talkative, often taking advantage of having a captive audience who can't reply because they've either got a hot towel on their face or a cutthroat razor at their throat.\nSee also Chatty Hairdresser.\n"}
{"PaintItBlack": "A specific form of Evil Costume Switch, one that requires no effort whatsoever on the part of the newly evil party.\nSee, your Transformation Trinket, your Empathic Weapon, and your costume aren't too happy with your Face\u2013Heel Turn. Being inanimate objects, though, the only way they can express their disapproval is to turn black and evil-looking \u2014 goodbye Frills of Justice, hello Spikes of Villainy. The transformation usually, if not always, happens right before your eyes and those of your astonished friends, just for dramatic flair.\nA possible variant is when a character happens to be split between good or evil or gain an Enemy Without (sometimes just for a Mirror Match); the Evil Twin (or both) might immediately get Color-Coded for Your Convenience in the process. In visual media, it naturally helps the viewer telling apart the good guy and the bad guy.\nA Sub-Trope of Convenient Color Change and Evil Makeover.\nCompare Evil Wears Black.\nThis trope is named for The Rolling Stones song \"Paint It Black\", although the song itself is completely unrelated to the trope. For the Nancy A. Collins novel (also named after the song), see Sonja Blue. It is also unrelated to Ron the Death Eater, formerly known as the other thing named after the same song (\"Paint the Hero Black\"), which involves more than a costume change.\nImportant Note: Please read the trope description before adding any new example. It is NOT about characters getting a new black (or even darker) outfit. It's about a costume/color change being spontaneous. Unfitting examples will be removed.\n"}
{"DarkShepherd": "Good's version of temptation. When moral argument falls on deaf ears, a Good Shepherd might have a Dark Shepherd moment, herding the sheep along the path of righteousness with the stabby end of the crook.\nIf the baddie has been remonstrated in some morally sound way, once they're around the corner, safe and alone, they may suffer doubt... or perhaps he was only acting remorseful to escape, with no intention of repentance. Whether out of habit or malice, the villain is poised to forget the moral lesson and do the exact same thing that got him in trouble. At which point, the Dark Shepherd steps in.\nThe Good Shepherd is optimistic in his heavenly intentions and arguments, but the Dark Shepherd focuses on the evil in people. The Dark Shepherd is a spiritual Drill Sergeant Nasty who resorts to threats and fear in the sheep's moment of doubt or descent, to scare the sheep away from the edge of the cliff.\nThe Dark Shepherd can be evil. His point is that you shouldn't be. While his Good Counterpart has integrity, the Dark Shepherd has low expectations. Out of sympathy or disgust, he sees the sheep as egocentric, thoughtlessly driven by pleasure or pain, incapable of learning, or perhaps just too addicted to bad behavior, too weak to make the right decision like a hero.\nIf the sheep won't do the right things for the right reasons, the Dark Shepherd encourages an alternative.\nA Dark Shepherd moment can become a lasting transformation when a good character is made weak by a lapse of faith, resorting to evil methods (intimidation, insult, injury) to achieve an end. The underlying assumption can be dark: Good deeds aren't intrinsically satisfying enough. However, the Dark Shepherd may remain good and faithful if the motivation behind his action is merciful: Good is hard to understand and choose at first, so in the meantime...\nHeaven is the carrot; Hell is the stick; the Dark Shepherd wields the latter.\n(Watch for common markers such as surprising the sheep alone with their conscience and giving incentive that a more moral character Good Shepherd is unable to give with integrity.)\nA form of Good Is Not Nice. Through the lens of Good Cop/Bad Cop, the Dark Shepherd closes the sieve. However, usually aware of the somewhat shameful nature of his persuasion, the Dark Shepherd's work is often private, behind the back of any Good Shepherd that may put a stop to it.\nCompare Knight Templar and Hobbes Was Right. Not to be confused with Dark Messiah.\n"}
{"KindRestraints": "In many works, a character can end up being Not Himself. He or she could even hurt someone, or admit to someone that they are worried they might hurt someone. Sometimes, they're just acting oddly enough to give people reason to think that they're crazy and/or dangerous to themselves and others. Often, their freedom is taken away by their own friends or allies to keep them safe and unable to harm themselves or other people. This could be by restraint, sedation, or confinement.\nThis will often happen in a safe location, such as their base or a hospital (or whatever serves as one), and will often result in some fight between the captive and the captor(s). This can result in Breaking the Bonds, or if they gain superpowers it could become a Cardboard Prison. Those keeping them captive may employ some sort of Kryptonite Factor to keep them under control. This could also result in an Unwanted Rescue. If they ask to be restrained, it can overlap with No Matter How Much I Beg.\nThe character being confined does not need to be willing, and the characters to whom they lose their freedom don't need to be benevolent. However, their confinement has to be for safety, and not for malice or punishment, in order to actually fit this trope.\nSubtrope of Cruel to Be Kind. See Percussive Prevention for a more extreme version of this trope.\n"}
{"RogueDrone": "The Hive Mind's version of a Heel Face (or Face Heel) Turn. One problem with writing the members of the Hive Mind is that it leaves little room for individual characterisation since everyone pretty much acts the same way (their personalities being subordinated to the greater whole). Enter the rogue drone, a member of the hive whose mind has somehow broken off of the central entity, opening up the path for him to become an unique character on his own right.\nRarely does the drone itself choose to be that way, though. It may be that the drone has displayed \"odd\" behavior even before their change, and a rare few may even have developed individuality on their own. Most of them, however, are simply victims of circumstance, who were genuinely faithful and devoted servants up until the point when enemy influence or an unfortunate disaster disconnected them from the central core. For most drones, this is a life-shattering event. Most of them do not have a natural concept of individuality, and without a higher authority to make decisions for them they become lost and confused. A lot of them attempt to rejoin their hive, only to be driven away because Individuality Is Illegal.\nMany feel incapacitated and insignificant on their own. Human social hierarchy can work as a substitute, and many of them end up joining the main cast as the Token Heroic Orc. Developing a personality is both a challenge and a source of anguish (as it removes them even further from their peers). Choosing a name is often depicted as one of the first milestones they need to conquer. Expect them to still go on long rants about how individuality is incomparable to the satisfaction of being part of a greater whole. They are often subject to the the Pinocchio Syndrome as they are trying to understand human customs and thinking.\nIt should be noted that while in most cases the Hive Mind is depicted as \"evil\" and the rogue unit as \"good\", this is sometimes reversed. Deserters from a good overmind tend to be a lot more powerful and destructive, undermining their own hive from within abusing the fact that the hive does not expect its members to turn on each other.\nA variant of My Species Doth Protest Too Much. Compare the Phlebotinum Rebel. See also Grew Beyond Their Programming.\n"}
{"CombatSadoMasochist": "Some fight for honor, others glory, and a few just for the thrill of fighting.\nThen there are these people.\nThe Combat Sadomasochist enjoys the pain from combat wounds, both their own and others'. When cut, stabbed or shot, they will moan in ecstasy and lap up the blood. After harming an opponent, and especially when they take a life, the sensation and expression on their face will be orgasmic. Their battle style will usually be intense and dance-like, and they usually eschew efficiently killing enemies in favor of doing so in the most painful way possible. Expect this character to use the Deliberate Injury Gambit a lot. If the Combat Sadomasochist wins the battle and there are enemy survivors they won't receive the Geneva Convention treatment of POWs. If said survivors are languishing or in pain and ask for a merciful (or at least swift) death, they'll dawdle just a bit to make them squirm by sticking fingers in wounds or shooting/stabbing them some more.\nThey probably evolve from a thrill seeker who craves combat adrenaline, but usually also have or develop another fetish along with this. Naturally, these types tend to be Too Kinky to Torture; even if they do feel pain, they're too warped to register it as something bad. Nor do they fear death, since most perceive it as the ultimate rush. However, as extreme hedonists, they can be intimidated with the threat of a long life of bland painlessness.\nIf a hero has this trait, he's often an Anti-Hero or a Sociopathic Hero who limits his violence to bad guys (or worse guys than them, at least). If a bad guy has this trait (and it's usually a bad guy who has this, as enjoyment of other people's pain in battle is a rather villainous trait), he's usually some kind of Psycho for Hire and often Ax-Crazy.\nSee also: Interplay of Sex and Violence, Orgasmic Combat.

{"EveryoneHatesMath": "Algebra! Calculus! Geometry! Arithmetic! How can we even begin to describe these unspeakable horrors, guaranteed to strike fear, anxiety, nausea, paranoia, madness, and paralysis into the hearts and souls of all? Mathematics, most of all the advanced courses that delve in otherworldly chaotic theories, easily presents itself as torturous, mindscrewy, or just downright mind-rapingly Lovecraftian- to the point that the old man himself indeed was big on this bandwagon, largely because of having a problem with math himself.\nIrrational fear of the theorem of Pythagoras is inevitable. Even the most basic of long division is portrayed as mind-bogglingly difficult, especially for parents helping their grade-schoolers do homework. Usually when trying to portray math in this light, writers (particularly in visual media like film) will show a piece of paper/whiteboard/blackboard full of abominably complex equations; use of integral signs, Gratuitous Greek letters (particularly pi and sigma), daemonic occultist geometries, the accursed variables 'x' and 'y' and suchforth are prevalent. Any scene where mathematics is being taught will invariably result in children being bored, falling asleep, or in a few cases, succumbing to gibbering schizophrenia from the Cyclopean confusion of it all (thus the Mad Mathematician).\nTo those who practice it, higher math is an art form like any other. The average person can criticize it as incomprehensible, but so are many beautiful and acclaimed works of art and science. Mathematicians imagine a situation, often very simple (a triangle inside a circle, or a sequence of numbers) and then through imaginative and often esoteric application of very basic axioms, find out incredible things; the axioms are the mathematician's paintbox, and the situation in question is their canvas. Constructing a proof is analogous to writing a poem or painting a picture; math is actually more about imagination, intuition and game-like problem solving than about simply following learned formulae and methods. Unfortunately math education doesn't work like this; children are taught in bland black-and-white that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 or that sin(2a) = 2sin(a)cos(a) but will never, or rarely, be told WHY, or asked to prove it; merely to commit these methods to memory, regurgitating them onto a set of dry, uninspired questions and exercises as required.\nProbably occurs because Writers Cannot Do Math. Alternatively, the boredom and hatred the writer had for math may cause Writers Cannot Do Math. Even more alternatively, people who show talent and interest for math tend to be drawn into lucrative math-needing careers, leaving the next generation of writers to be drawn from the set of people who Cannot Do Math. In other (more cynical) words, if writers could do math, they'd be doing the math careers and getting paid big bucks instead of hammering out romance novels to avoid starvation!\nSee also: E = MC Hammer, in which writers who cannot do math try to represent it onscreen, and Mad Mathematician, in which people who do enjoy math are portrayed as utterly deranged.\nContrast Good with Numbers.\nNote: Americans say \"math\" on the basis that it's an uncountable noun, but in the UK, they say \"maths\" on the basis that it's short for \"mathematics,\" which, while still an uncountable noun, ends with \"s.\" Use the right word in the examples for whichever dialect you use. If you're not sure, just use the non-abbreviated \"mathematics,\" which is correct on both sides of the Atlantic.\n"}
{"WilliamFakespeare": "William Shakespeare is obviously a celebrated and well-known author, leading to a number of references to his writings in countless works. However, some works, typically Medieval European Fantasy or those in a Renaissance or Baroque analogue, go a step further by having an in-universe writer obviously modeled after Shakespeare. Besides being referenced/read by characters, characters will also often attend or act in one of this writer's plays, allowing for an Affectionate Parody of Shakespeare with lots of Stylistic Suck and lampshading of dramatic conventions associated with his works (i.e. characters giving long speeches while dying, men playing female roles, including female roles disguised as men, and the tendency of tragedies to end with the deaths of nearly the entire cast). On occasion, the Shakespeare analogue will even be a character in the story. Because of some evidence that Shakespeare may have acted in some of his own plays, including according to legend, the Player King in Hamlet, some Shakespeare expies that appear will likewise be (invariably hammy) lead actors in their own plays.\nBesides Shakespeare's popularity, one likely reason for the frequent creation of in-universe equivalents is that Shakespeare's own plays often had meta-theatrical elements (i.e. The Tempest, Henry V, and As You Like It), and also sometimes included play-within-a-play scenes containing Self-Parody (i.e. The Taming of the Shrew, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and Hamlet). which also likely explains the large number of works involving a play-within-a-play where the characters perform Shakespeare (i.e. Kiss Me Kate and The Dresser).\nSubtrope of No Historical Figures Were Harmed.

{"LoveIsACrime": "No Hugging, No Kissing, No PDA of any kind!\nThe penalization of romance stems from the idea that The Power of Love either Makes You Evil, Crazy, Uncreative or just plain Dumb. Love just seems like a bad idea, so what better way to better the human condition than just banning love all together?\nThis is a strange, if-not impossible law to regulate and enforce in real life, so those that enforce it are foolishly idealistic at best, unreasonable and tyrannical at worst, inspiring various rebellions of various shapes and sizes in the process. The Evil Overlord behind it could have a variety of reasons for doing so. They could have had a personal experience with failed love, thinking that if they can't have love, then no one can, or maybe they feel that they are committing a service to others and preventing heart-break. If completely eradicated from society, people could ask \"What Is This Thing You Call \"Love\"?\"\nShould the love banned be physical, then it's No Sex Allowed, or at least No Heterosexual Sex Allowed to keep the population down.\n"}

{"GamingClan": "One of the most iconic forms of gamer community, arguably even more so than the E-Sports team. At its most basic the gaming clan is simply a bunch of gamers who regularly play one or more games together under some form of group identity.\nAs with teams in other sports, they vary widely in their style, level of formality, membership requirements etc. For example, many First-Person Shooter clans use military styles and even award \"medals\" while those in MMORPGs may have a multi-layered bureaucracy as if they are player-run nations. Some may require members to be extremely participatory while others simply need assurance that a player isn't going to jump to another game in the near future.\nA common feature of all of these is the \"clan tag\", which players will display when they are playing in a match or on a general server. It's basically a uniform. If a clan was called Sabre Knights From Miami, their tag might be SKFM. Newer games tend to at least have integrated clan tag functionality while many have adopted services such as clan-exclusive chat channels and administrative powers for clan leaders that used to be handled externally on each clan's own website(s).\nThe term \"Clan\" for gaming teams likely came from BattleTech, which featured ritualistic warring factions known as clans. With the release of multiplayer functionality with MechWarrior 2: 31st Century Combat, amongst the first Deathmatch styled PC games, players formed groups based on them as a way to act out fantasy battles. Completely original clans popped up soon after. Nowadays, lack of official clan infrastructure is seen as a serious flaw in new multiplayer-centric games and many successful clans have extensive out of game activities including websites, merchandising, product endorsement and offline public relations events.\n"}
{"MookMaker": "A device or enemy whose main purpose is to constantly spit out enemies for the player to fight. Some bosses have this ability, to add to the challenge, to make the player want to hurl the controller at the TV screen, or to give the player something to use to hit or get to the boss villain's weak point.\nSometimes the Mook Maker can be destroyed; other times your only real tactic is to dodge them and move on. Or, depending on the game, the enemies can be farmed for goodies, points, cash, Experience Points, or Infinite 1-Ups. In the latter case, the game may cause the Maker to stop generating enemies after a while to prevent the player from abusing it too much.\nIf the Mook Maker is, in fact, a boss, expect to see it fairly late in the game, with the implication that the boss is the one who has produced all the Mooks in the game.\nReal-Time Strategy games feature Mook Maker buildings very often.\nSee also Clown-Car Grave, and Explosive Breeder. Compare to Enemy Summoner, which is like Mook Maker but with the ability to fight on their own too, Spawn Broodling when mook-making is a form of attack, or The Minion Master when a character has the ability to create Mooks. Weaponized Offspring may be a subtrope of this. Mother of a Thousand Young can overlap. This is also a good way a villain can avoid Mook Depletion.\n"}
{"MakeRoomForTheNewPlot": "Sometimes, earlier plot elements must be quickly rushed aside in order to make room for newer ones, necessitating fast resolutions. What this usually entails is that the main thrust of the plot thus far must be resolved within a few scenes so we can hurry up and get to the new main event.\nThis trope can be frustrating if, until this resolution, the first plot had been portrayed as being a very difficult situation to deal with, only to be quickly solved now that the plot demands it. There are several ways around this \u2014 the main one is to turn the old problem into a sort of Worf Effect for the narrative as a whole. It establishes that, as bad as the old situation was, the new one is substantially worse, and requires our full attention without distractions. If the original part of the plot's conflict was largely diplomatic, for example, it's quite understandable that everyone is willing to put it aside to deal with the newer threat.\nA relatively organic way of enacting a Halfway Plot Switch and averting an Aborted Arc. Compare Always a Bigger Fish, Rising Conflict and Wrap It Up.\nNote that this trope, nearly by definition, involves spoilers since the new plot can only really show up in the middle of the story.\n"}
{"OurGiantsAreDifferent": "Human beings, but super-sized. Giants have been around since the times of ancient mythology. In various mythologies, gigantic peoples are featured as primeval creatures associated with chaos and the wild, and they are frequently in conflict with the gods, be they Olympian or Norse. These creatures may range in size from around 7 feet (the average size of the tallest Real Life humans), to truly colossal proportions.\nThe most common perception of the giant is the big, dumb brute who grinds people's bones to make his bread. But literal gentle giants are also featured in both legends and modern stories, who are somewhat friendlier (and sometimes smarter) than the stereotype would imply. The evil types may be antagonists in their own right or serve as Giant Mooks (pun intended) for an Evil Overlord.\nIn Real Life, the profusion of Giants in mythology is usually attributed to memories of childhood, when adults tower over you, and also the rivalry between young men and old men. It may also be partially related to people finding the bones of massive animals (especially elephants or extinct animals like sauropod dinosaurs and giant ground sloths) and mistaking them for the bones of giant humanoids.\nThis is Older Than Feudalism. Not to be confused with The Giant, who may be a big wrestler, but isn't nearly that big. See also Smash Mook, Giant Mook, Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever.\nReally huge giants, in any real-world context, would fall victim to the Square-Cube Law in short order, but the vast majority of such beings tend to exist in fantasy universes that cheerfully disregard such things as the laws of physics in favor of creating a good story. Not necessarily, the Square-Cube Law can still apply, just do the math backwards. And voila, you now have an explanation for why Giants are also extremely tough and powerful.\n"}
{"MergingMistake": "Fusions are cool. They allow two beings to merge together to create a stronger being. However, fusions are in practice incredibly dangerous. Was it done with science, biologically or through magic, even a slightest mistake can make the results be less than ideal if you're lucky.\nHow the fusion can result in a failure varies. Sometimes the result is a mesh of body parts or full of deformities. Sometimes the fusion at first looks fine but is actually incredibly unstable, and will fall apart at some point. Sometimes the fusion wasn't intended to happen in the first place, what just increases the chance of it being really wrong. The only real requirement is that the fusion needs to be physical in nature.\nNote that just because the fusion isn't good, that doesn't mean it's necessarily by mistake. The fusion can be inherently bad due to who is being fused with who.\nOne of possible results in a Teleporter Accident or in a case of a Tele-Frag, or a case of a faulty Merging Machine. Might result in a Clipped-Wing Angel situation. Shapeshifter Mashup may be the result of this, but just as often it's an intentional result. Compare Assimilation Backfire.\n"}
{"TheInquisitorGeneral": "Ask anybody in the military, what's the most nerve-wracking experience they will ever face? Enemy tanks? Air strikes? Being shot to death?\nNo, you may find they most lament having to deal with The Inquisitor General.\nThis is a character whose job it is to go over everything you do with a fine-toothed comb and an electron microscope, making sure to catalog each of your transgressions, big and small. He could be a Drill Sergeant Nasty, The Neidermeyer, or even Colonel Badass. Assuming that he is a benevolent form of this trope, his goal is to help you become as flawless at what you do as possible, so you'll be less likely to make any mistakes when it counts for real. Of course, it's also possible that he's a Jerk Ass whose only goal is to make you look like an incompetent fool or get you angry enough to do something you'll regret.\nGiven his role, the Inquisitor General will tend to be Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, or Lawful Evil. This is, of course, very much Truth in Television for many organizations, who use these guys as checks against complacency and corruption.\nSub-Trope to The Inspector Is Coming and a Sister Trope to Internal Affairs, which is more commonly found in works about the police. Compare and contrast with The Political Officer.\n"}
{"TelePathy": "Telepathy/Mind Reading is a psychic power that allows a character to read another person's thoughts and/or communicate with them mentally\nUsually, those thoughts are Conveniently Coherent Thoughts.\nAt its most basic level, it functions as a short range radio, allowing the character to pick up the thoughts of those around him. Sometimes, it has limitations such as touch or proximity, or only being able to 'hear' rather than 'see' thoughts. A common hurdle comes from being unable to probe deeper into the minds of those around them, as well as being something of a Fainting Seer whenever an especially strong willed or horrifying character is around. Psychic overload is also common in crowds, represented by a Psychic Nosebleed. Being a passive receptor and not being able to shut other people's thoughts out can easily drive a psychic insane, making this potentially Blessed with Suck.\nMore advanced uses of telepathy involve receiving and transmitting thoughts and memories, and probing beneath surface thoughts into memories, or outright going into a Journey to the Center of the Mind or dream travel. Some telepaths may be able to use Astral Projection, or at least see through other people's eyes.\nAt its strongest, a telepath will be able to Mind Control others, sometimes even to the point of possessing their bodies, create Fake Memories after applying Laser-Guided Amnesia, create a Split Personality and let it take over, or in general be a terrifying god who can Mind Rape their opponents.\nIt's worth noting that for the above reasons telepathy is one of the most potentially pervertable powers, since it's basically an invasion of privacy of the worst kind. The telepath is the sighted man in the kingdom of the blind, and provided he's discreet he can know everyone down to their most intimate detail, and can use them accordingly. This is a lot worse when he's the overlord. Thus, mind readers in Real Life would be complete Paranoia Fuel. This is why in settings with un-masqueraded telepaths, they are often persecuted, policed, and registered. That is, when they aren't used as weapons or killed.\nHeroic telepaths are thus in a difficult position both inside and outside a story proving Bad Powers, Bad People is not true. An author wants them to be heroes, but has to somehow assuage the reader the character isn't a mental voyeur (or if he is, he's got a chivalrous side) and the character will also have to put their colleagues at ease that they aren't likely to turn into a Mind Probing Hive Queen. To solve this, they often practice what they preach with Mind over Manners.\nTelepathy comes in a lot of flavors:\nIn a setting where there are telepaths, expect people to use Psychic Static to protect their thoughts, and telepaths to construct a Psychic Block Defense to give each other a Poke in the Third Eye when they're snooping. Usually indicated by the Pstandard Psychic Pstance. When the ability requires physical contact it's Touch Telepathy.\nSubtropes:\n"}
{"Bildungsroman": "A story featuring an adolescent making the mental leap from child to adult. In real life, this happens over the course of several years. Literature, films and some television series are media that have the space to show the story at a slow pace. But for a movie, things have to be compressed to several months at the most, so expect some really accelerated character development. Tends to happen to a character anywhere from 13 to 20 years of age.\nUsually includes some combination of the following:\nAn increasingly popular comedy subversion is the Delayed Coming of Age Story, in which the person has remained mentally a child his entire life and only finally experiences these things sometime between his late 20s and mid-40s.\nMainstream film coming-of-age stories tend toward dramedy. Independent film or novel stories lean toward drama, sometimes jumping headlong into Wangst.\nThe word bildungsroman (Ger. \"educational novel\") or bildungsgeschichte (Ger. \"educational story\") are sometimes used to describe these kinds of stories. A note on the translation: the terms originated in the Age of Enlightenment, when \"Bildung\" meant not only \"education\" but also \"self-improvement\" (cf. English \"building\"). In other words, it's not a \"novel to educate the readers\" but a \"novel about the hero becoming someone\".\nSee also Age-Progression Song, Ode to Youth.\n"}
{"ToylessToyLineCharacter": "In Merchandise-Driven media it's typically pretty easy to set apart the characters whose toys are getting advertised. They're the ones that take the spotlight in any given story, save the day in the end, etc., or are otherwise just made to look cool by the narrative itself. They'll have more character development, more detail in their character model, more gadgets; everything about them screams toyetic in loud plastic-mould colors.\nBut not this character. This is the Ensemble Dark Horse of the toyline-driven media, that bursts into the scene like a Highly Visible Ninja with a rocket launcher and a banner reading, \"Buy all our playsets and toys\" only, after rushing to the toy store, mouth drooling and brow sweaty, you find out he doesn't have his own toy. Often they'll be The Ace, appearing for a brief storyline, showing up everyone else, and then never seen again\u2014not in the story and never in the toy aisles.\nMost of the time for a Merchandise-Driven franchise the toys are either (a) designed first and the show/comic makers make a story around the characters, or (b) the toy makers and show makers work together, so everyone else is likely to be a Flat Character, or even No Name Given. Often there are actual limits set to how much attention can be given to these characters; a non-toy character that's not just a Tag Along Kid being allowed to be prominent is next to unheard of.\nIt seems bizarre and even out-of-place\u2014which is not to say unwelcome\u2014when an original character does become important. They're not always recurring characters but they sometimes get more development and attention than characters that actually had toys, because there's usually Loads and Loads of Characters.\nWhy this happens varies, sometimes a writer that's been banging his shackles against the wall long enough manages to loosen them enough to get creative and inject a character into the story for the character's own sake. Sometimes a Monster of the Week winds up getting a little more attention than usual and starts looking toyetic.\nIn a boys' show, generally the Tag Along Kid, the armies of mooks, and in older series, the Token Girl will need to be created for the show, and in a girls' show it's the same for the villains in general.\nThis is not just any character who doesn't appear in his story's toyline. Also note that with many long-running franchises, sometimes toys will be made of these characters and marketed to collectors. The point isn't that no toy exists, but that when the media was made, the character wasn't being used to advertise one.\nIf a major female character from a Merchandise-Driven series ends up as a Toyless Toyline Character, it's probably because of The Smurfette Principle.\nSee also Sir Not-Appearing-in-This-Trailer.\nExamples are sorted by where the character appeared. Franchises spanning more than one media category, like Transformers and G.I. Joe, have more than one entry.\nCompare Canon Foreigner.\n"}
{"PhilosophicalChoiceEndings": "A specific type of Multiple Endings, where the player makes a Last-Second Ending Choice by taking a final stand on the Central Theme of the game, which may be presented as a Driving Question that they must answer with their choice. When done well, it presents to the player a moral dilemma with no clear right answer, ideally preceded by arguments for and against each position they can take on it.\nOften overlaps with Faction-Specific Endings if the in-game factions represent different answers on the game's Driving Question. Alignment-Based Endings can be seen as a subtrope of this, but because they're usually clearly labeled as \"Good\" and \"Evil\", it takes the philosophical edge off the player's decision.\nSince this is an Ending Trope, beware of spoilers.\n"}
{"ComicallyLopsidedRivalry": "Maybe it's to illustrate one of our heroes' quick wit or smarts. Maybe it's to remind the viewer that the character isn't entirely a loser. Or perhaps the writers just love them.\nWhatever the reason, many shows create a one-sided rivalry between two contrasting characters. Character A, usually part of the main cast, almost always wins. Character B may score some victories in the conflict, but by the time the credits roll, character A will have outdone B in such a way that there's no response to it. Sometimes, just to add salt to the wound, Character A may reveal they never even considered Character B to be a rival at all.\nA particular kind of interaction between Sitcom Arch-Nemeses. Related to Curb-Stomp Battle, but usually much less violent. If the constant loser is a recurring villain, not another main character, then this overlaps with The Good Guys Always Win.\nSee A Taste of Defeat (for all cases) and Team Rocket Wins (for villainous cases) if the victorious character's winning streak is finally broken for once.\nAdvertising\nComic Books\nComic Strips\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nProfessional Wrestling\nWebcomics\nWeb Video\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"RapeIsTheNewDeadParents": "A popular way to establish a character as having a motivation for their depression, angst, distrust of others, and other anti-social tendencies is to have the revelation that he or she was raped at some point in his or her past. The overwhelming majority of characters given this treatment are female, but there are still cases of male characters, although even that is predominantly by other men.\n\"Ordinary\" male-on-female rape, on the contrary, is extremely common in bad fanfiction. What better justification could your Sympathetic Sue have for her boundless angst than having been raped in her past? If given almost no weight to the story, then it's been handled very badly.\nThere is Truth in Television to this trope, considering that rape is an extremely traumatic event and can cause serious mental illness and psychological repercussions. The fact that some writers use it to cheap effect for drama is not thought of highly. See also Child by Rape and Promiscuity After Rape.\n"}
{"SemanticSuperpower": "A power that is defined solely by wording, and thus capable of a great deal of stretching what it is capable of. Can be used to justify Heart Is an Awesome Power. Done poorly, it comes across as an Ass Pull unless it's obviously being Played for Laughs.\nIn many cases, this is an example of a weapon or power that overtly tests the creativity of the wielder and their ability to think outside the box. Often, when villains get ahold of the device, they fail at using it, only to be scolded by the hero that their flaw is that they lack the imagination and creativity to make any real use of the item. A creative villain with a power like this, on the other hand, is one to be very much feared.\nSee also When All You Have Is a Hammer..., Imagination-Based Superpower, and Swiss-Army Superpower. Compare/contrast the Inverse Law of Complexity to Power. See also Literal Genie. Not to be confused with superpowers that actually consist of using speech or specific words.\n"}
{"EarthIsTheCentreOfTheUniverse": "Earth is a Weirdness Magnet for cosmically significant events.\nAncient interstellar evil sealed away? It's sealed on Earth.\nFuturistic, star-spanning alliance with hundreds of member races? The capital is Earth. (Colonized Solar System optional.)\nSome alien or another, whether it's one ship or its entire race, crash-lands, with no possible means of control for where they end up? Earth. (More specifically, either Central Park or the Budokan.)\nAliens invading some random planet for no adequately explained reason? Earth.\nIf, against all odds, it's just next on the list for an alien menace that has conquered hundreds of worlds before it, Earth will more often than not be that elusive last planet they needed to make their conquest of the region/galaxy/universe complete. And almost every time, it's Earth where a resistance to the aliens' evil ways will finally succeed, no matter how improbable.\nObviously, in a particularly extreme form of Creator Provincialism, it's easier for Earthling writers to come up with sympathetic characters and situations when they're on the same planet as the viewers. But when a series has hundreds of worlds to choose from, it's amazing how often they go back to the same one.\nIt could be that the reason we don't hear about the invasions of other planets is that we weren't there, and we don't know about the baddies till they visit us. If that's the case, though, the universe must be teeming with ancient evils, reviving marauder races, and professional invaders to the point where it's amazing any peaceful race has survived for more than five minutes.\nOn the other hand, maybe it's because Humans Are Special.\nOf course, maybe Science Fiction shows really do show aliens invading the planet Zog just as often as they do Earth. It's just that those shows are only aired on the planet Zog, where Earth is just one of the countless Insignificant Little Blue Planets.\nSub-tropes are, of course, Tokyo Is the Center of the Universe and Big Applesauce. For subversions and aversions, see Insignificant Little Blue Planet and Earth That Was. For nation or region specific examples, see Creator Provincialism.\n"}
{"RenamedTheSame": "So, Alice and Bob are having a discussion about what Bob's new name will be, since he's grown tired of it. He contemplates for a long time, then eventually figures out the perfect name that'd suit him perfectly.\nBob renames himself Robert.\nNaturally, Alice is confused by this. The new name is nearly identical to his old name. Nonetheless, he sticks to his \"new\" name, despite it barely being different at all.\nThis trope is often times Played for Laughs. Where there would originally be a Meaningful Rename, the character's new name is basically what they always had before. Usually, there is a reaction from others as to the pointlessness of the new name. Compare This Is My Name on Foreign, which may even be this if the foreign name is similar enough, like Robert becoming Roberto.\n"}
{"AllTheoriesAreTrue": "The Sci-Fi Counterpart of All Myths Are True, this is when long-obsolete, fringe, or disproven scientific theories are considered true for the purposes of either Rule of Cool or Art Major Technology. Examples should be distinguished from Science Marches On, as in this trope's case the use of dodgy science is quite deliberate. This is sometimes a supertrope of Ancient Astronauts, Lamarck Was Right, Genetic Memory, Our Cryptids Are More Mysterious, Psychic Dreams for Everyone and many other tropes found right here on this wiki, and arguably underpins most modern uses of alchemy in Speculative Fiction. It's also rampant in Steam Punk, which is often set in universes where, for example, the theory of the aether is true.\nThe trope comes in one of two flavors: Obsolete science may be used to evoke associations with the past in a manner resembling Zeerust Canon; alternately, fringe or obsolete science may be used to evoke the notion that all manner of far out ideas are really true in this particular fictional universe. More generally, it covers fringe or obsolete scientific concepts that are just part of a story's premise and aren't used to evoke anything.\nIt does not include plain bad or mistaken notions of the You Fail Science Forever sort, though it can be hard to tell sometimes. The criterion for inclusion on this list is that the concept involved is a real fringe or obsolete theory meant to explain an already-observed phenomenon that the work treats as true for reasons of premise or style. In other words, the explanations are speculative or obsolete; the phenomena explained are, however exaggerated, real. Super Trope for modern uses of Counter-Earth, Hollow World, Pineal Weirdness, and Lamarck Was Right; and for most uses of Ancient Astronauts.\nReal Life examples abound, of course, but should be avoided unless they have been the basis of fictional works or story premises.\n"}
{"ReadingTeaLeaves": "Tasseomancy (alternatively known as tasseography or tassology) is a form of divination that interprets patterns in tea leaves, coffee grounds, or wine sediments.\nThe method involves the quarant (the person getting their fortune told) being provided with a cup of a particular drink (Tea, Coffee and Wine being the most common forms). They are asked to drink from a specific cup, leaving a small amount for the leaves and/or pulp to gather. The leaves/pulp then form a variety of shapes, from animals to inanimate objects, even mythical creatures and specific people. These shapes hold symbolic significance, their presence spelling things ranging from good fortune to omens of doom.\nRelated to other methods of fortune-telling like Crystal Ball reading and Tarot Cards.\n"}
{"BacktoBackBadasses": "When two people are completely surrounded, outnumbered and outgunned, by simply coming together and having their backs against each other, they are suddenly much more capable. Usually involves a lot of spinning and may lead to Radial Ass Kicking. The fully realized fight scene of this image is the Bash Brothers. A warrior's most vulnerable area is his back, and by putting their backs together, two warriors can eliminate this disadvantage and turn it into an advantage.\nThe Rival will do this instantly with the hero should any third party interfere, because naturally they are the only one who should be allowed to fight the hero. It also underlines the respect and trust they each, despite their banter, have for the other. Battle Couples and their non-romantic counterparts, Fire-Forged Friends also love this trope. Occasionally this backfires on one character, when the other proves not so trustworthy, but not often. May result in an Offhand Backhand by one character to protect another.\nObviously invokes the Conservation of Ninjutsu. Contrast Badass Back. Geometrical opposite of Mexican Standoff.\nThis is Truth in Television. The method allows the two fighters to split their opponents between them, and keeps anyone from literally stabbing either person In the Back. Military historian Mike Loades speculates that medieval knights fought on foot in this manner, and at the present, Special Forces operatives storming buildings clear out rooms this way.\n"}
{"TotallyNotAWerewolf": "When a Voluntary Shapeshifter's alternate form is mistaken for another monster by humans.\nThe lore behind werewolves is myopic at best. Some werewolves are Voluntary Shapeshifters, others are Cursed or infected with Involuntary Shapeshifting. Thus, it's easy to assume that if you see any character working and living a human life by day, but running through the woods and howling at the moon by night, then you should at least pack a Silver Bullet in case you run into them during a full moon... right?\nWRONG. They're not that kind of werewolf. The Universe Bible defines the rules and requirements for being a \"werewolf,\" and this individual doesn't fit the description of the creatures that bible ascribes the terminology to. But at least they'll forgive you\u2014they must deal with this confusion all the time. Depending on the individual's demeanor, some may even play off the confusion.\nA subtrope of Our Werebeasts Are Different and Not Using the \"Z\" Word, where multiple kinds of werewolves exist in a work but the word \"werewolf\" itself is only used in-universe to refer to one specific variety. Contrast Not a Zombie (where a person refuses to acknowledge the existence of zombies when confronted with one) and Actually Not a Vampire (where a normal person is mistaken for a supernatural monster).\nIf someone has to actually keep saying that they're \"Totally Not A Werewolf\", beware: They may also be Most Definitely Not a Villain, and one should consult Insistent Terminology (and possibly Suspiciously Specific Denial) for more details.\nShould the Voluntary Shapeshifter be mistaken for the monster by other members of its own species, this may be due to the romantic phenomenon of Attractive Bent Species.\n"}
{"TheGMIsACheatingBastard": "...but sometimes, they're our cheating bastard.\nWhile Video Games are run by a cold, inhuman computer, Tabletop Games can be more flexible because they spring from the mind of living, breathing Game Master (who may or may not be cold and inhuman). The Random Number God's power can be broken, plot-devices can appear to save or bedevil the players, encounters can suddenly become harder or easier and, depending on whether or not the game is Serious Business, in-jokes can abound. There are even specialty \"Dungeon Master's Dice,\" which are more-or-less the same... but blank on every face!\nThis can be a blessing if the players want to send their adventure screaming Off the Rails or eschew the usual Fighter, Mage, Thief party structure for something more flavorful. A nice cheating bastard can make sure things stay fun for the newbies and maybe give the characters a little help when they've had a run of bad rolls. Unlike that bastard, the computer, a good GM will mainly fudge the rules to preserve the vastly more important Rule of Fun and Rule of Cool.\nHowever, this trope has a dark side.\nIf the nice GM takes things too far, the players' victories can seem preordained and hollow. And Pelor help you if a Killer Game Master is a cheating bastard... you might run up against a band of omniscient orcs that fight like they were trained as Spetsnaz. A sudden Ass Pull might save his Villain Sue, or you could miss a twenty-foot-long dragon because you Failed a Spot Check. If a particular player gets annoying, their character might get a Pit Fiend dropped on them. (Hell, the entire party may fall victim to falling rocks if the GM's feeling especially vindictive.) And remember those blank dice? A computer can't feel spite (as far as we know), but you may yet come to miss the Random Number God.\nBut take heart! It can be nice to Earn Your Happy Ending, and it certainly feels good to have your characters triumph in this GM's mad world. It can often be more fun to be killed by this GM than to survive the entire adventure of a GM that's too nice. And always remember, the GM's word may be absolute in the game, but kicking a excessively jerkassish GM out is not unheard of.\n"}

{"LostHimInACardgame": "Gambling seems to be a natural human activity. We have friendly bets on when Margaret's baby will be born. Not-so-friendly bets on which sports team will be victorious this year. Sometimes we stake money and sometimes the stakes are less tangible.\nIn fiction, however, it's perfectly okay to bet people in a game of chance. Typically a comedy trope, although you might find it in serious fiction with a setting where slavery is accepted.\nOften (especially if this is used to resolve a Love Triangle), whoever it was who thought the person was theirs to bet in the first place will \"lose\" them, whatever the result of the wager itself. That doesn't necessarily mean that the other party will \"win\" them, however.\nThis happens a lot with employers betting employees for whatever reason, yet the Justification \u2014 betting their employment contract rather than the employees themselves \u2014 is almost never used.\nMost often the card game is poker, but theoretically any form of game that allows The Bet would work. A comedic form of the Absurdly High-Stakes Game. Compare the Bachelor Auction, which is consensual on the \"traded\" person's part.\n"}
{"MushroomHouse": "A common feature Beneath the Earth, in the Mouse World and in The Lost Woods alike, it is not uncommon in fantasy settings to see people making their homes in hollowed-out mushrooms of various sorts. More often than not, this will happen in one of two ways, although exceptions and overlap of course exist:\nSometimes, this kind of residence will be made out of normal-sized mushrooms and will be the home of choice for diminutive humanoids such as gnomes, fairies, pixies and other such Lilliputians. These Mushroom Houses will typically look like toadstools with stout stems fitted with doorways and windows, and with the inside furnished to provide its inhabitant a comfortable home. The mushroom's cap \u2014 which will often, but not always, be red with white spots in resemblance to a fly agaric \u2014 may or may not be fitted with windows of its own. This sort of house is a common feature of the more magically inclined Mouse Worlds.\nThe other common variant involves normal-sized people living in giant-sized mushrooms instead. These will typically serve as a much more alien variant of the Arboreal Abode, highlighting the alien, magical or generally otherworldly and unusual nature of the place they're found in. This type may sometimes be paired with intelligent mushroom people.\nSee also Arboreal Abode, for the variant of this trope as applied to plants, and Fungus Humongous, for when normal-sized people live in house-sized mushrooms.\n"}
{"PowerGivesYouWings": "If an android, Humongous Mecha, Powered Armor, Mon, Magic Knight, Magical Girl, or basically any super powered individual gets a power up, or starts out really powerful and wants it to show, they will have wings.\nSpecifically, feathery white angelic wings, even for villains! (Though they might only have the one.) Wings made of Hard Light or Pure Energy are also popular; expect them to be Color-Coded for Your Convenience. These wings will of course allow the character to fly, float, and glow, all without needing to flap them! If the cast already has a character with a pair and he's been surpassed, the surpasser will have two pairs of wings. To differentiate what sort of wings your newly-powered-up character has gained, see Good Wings, Evil Wings.\nOften paired with a Holy Halo, just for the imagery, which you can enjoy here!\nThe title is a play on the Red Bull slogan \"Red Bull Gives you Wings!\" A subtrope of Growing Wings.\nThis item is available in the Trope Co. catalog.\n"}
{"MOBA": "The Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), also known as ARTS (Action Real Time Strategy)note\u00a0increasingly rarely due to the rise of FPS or Third-person MOBAs or Hero Brawler, is a relatively new game genre popularized in the first decade of the 21st century. While the Ur-Example was the Sega Genesis classic Herzog Zwei, the Trope Maker was Aeon of Strife, a map for Starcraft. It gained popularity and, when Warcraft III with its powerful Hero Units and amazing map editor came out, spawned a lot of similar maps which were referred to as AoS-style maps. Amongst others there were D-Day, various AoS direct ports, and Defense of the Ancients, developed by Eul. One of its own spinoffs, Defense Of The Ancients Allstars developed by Guinsoo, became the Trope Codifier by virtue of its astounding popularity, with a non-negligible fraction of Warcraft III sales driven solely by people who wanted to play DotA Allstars.\nThe heart of the MOBA genre lies in several basic qualities. First, it is relatively easy to play, being (typically) controlled through a point-and-click Real-Time Strategy interface but giving the player control of only one Hero Unit, with four or five skills, instead of a Command & Conquer Economy. In comparison of the other RTS games, this also makes the controllable character feel more unique and individual than just generic characters (which is quite ironic, because as far as this genre's plot goes, it's basically Excuse Plot). The player is assisted by a computer-controlled base and its minions, as well as four (sometimes two) Player Character teammates, each controlling their own Hero Unit, with the opposition consisting of the same. Second, it has Loads and Loads of Characters, making it easy to learn but difficult to master; not only is each character unique in its skills and abilities, but the large number of characters results in unique team compositions, with varying levels of synergy between them. Third, the objective is not to rack up enough kills, but rather to destroy the enemy's base. Killing the enemy heroes helps you with this, but is not a necessary step. Finally, Competitive Balance dictates that no Hero Unit can ever become powerful enough to win the game single-handedly; each character (or player) is deliberately limited in what elements they can contribute to the victory (crowd control, damage output, tanking, healing, etc), which is especially important once the teams start aggregating for five-on-five brawls. The result is a high emphasis on skill and teamwork, where communication and intelligent gameplay inevitably win out.\nAs the game progresses, AI-controlled minions (sometimes called \"lane creeps\" or just \"creeps\") spawn at each team's base and proceed along pre-programmed paths (\"lanes\"), traveling from allied tower to allied tower before assaulting the enemy towers. These minions will attack any enemy they come across such as opposing minions, opposing towers and opposing players. There are almost always fewer lanes than there are players - three player games typically have two lanes, while five player games typically have three lanes.\nIn-between these lanes is a region known as \"the jungle\", containing un-allied units (referred to as \"neutral creeps\" or \"monsters\") more powerful than minions which attack any unit from either team they come across - however, as these units remain in the jungle, they almost only ever encounter the playersnote\u00a0coming into contact with minions is generally attributed to Good Bad Bugs.\nMany games also include several powerful monsters in the jungle, weaker than a player character but dangerous to a badly wounded hero. Killing these monsters give some bonus for a short amount of time. One or two monsters in the jungle which are considerably more powerful than any hero, requiring coordination from the entire team to take down but grant large team-wide awards for killing them.\nEach player controls a single \"hero\" character unit. This character is considerably more powerful than any minion and the normal creeps in the jungle but less powerful than any tower, meaning it is easy for them to kill minions but assaulting a tower on their own is suicidal. Every hero unit has a unique set of abilities and statistics. A team is usually only allowed a single copy of any given hero. As a result, teams have a diverse membership of heroes, each filling different roles.\nHero units in the game grow inherently more powerful over time. Towers are either exempted from this or grow at a slower rate, meaning that the towers will inevitably be brought down by damage from both the minions and heroes. Player heroes gain power by killing enemy minions, neutral creeps, towers and enemy heroes. In many games, merely being around a killed enemy unit gives a hero Experience Points and/or money, but directly killing a creep will either give them a resource they don't gain passively (usually a Status Buff) or more of that resource - usually money. This mechanic makes up the core of the gameplay. The opposing heroes want to do the same thing, trying to kill the allied units in order to accumulate experience and moneynote\u00a0some games allow killing of your own minions to deny the enemy their rewards. Due to the lanes, allied minions will always go directly into contact with enemy minions and there are only a limited number of neutral monsters in the jungle to kill, forcing players to inevitably come into conflict with each other.\nThis conflict is accentuated by three additional factors. First, heroes are extremely valuable to kill, granting large amounts of money and experience. In many gamesnote\u00a0but increasingly being dropped due to the popularity of League of Legends, this is doubly harmful as the hero who is killed outright loses money. Secondly, if an enemy hero is killed or forced to retreat, there is no opposition while you kill enemy minions, racking up money and experience. This also denies the enemy hero the opportunity to do the same, damaging their ability to accumulate power and resources. Thirdly, if a lane is left undefended, it is easier to \"push\" the lane (leading allied minions in an attack on an enemy tower, which is typically programmed to prioritize killing minions, allowing you to damage it in relative anonymity).\nAs a result, a great deal of the interplay between the players and the teams comes from risk and reward; being more aggressive may make it easier to kill lots of enemy units, drive off enemy heroes, accumulate money more quickly, and damage enemy towers, but it also may leave you more vulnerable to counterattacks from enemy heroes, whether they be in the lane with you or ambushing you from the jungle (or both!). It should also be pointed out that the Instant-Win Condition involves demolishing the enemy\u2019s central building; killing enemy heroes will help you do this by giving you EXP, Gold and the freedom to roam around the map in safety (at least, until those enemies respawn), but that's all it does. It's entirely possible to \"backdoor\" a base by dodging the enemy team entirely and going straight to their core; likewise, it's possible to \"team-wipe\" the opposition, killing all five of them with no losses to your own side, but then not accomplish any useful demolition while they're dead.\nAs heroes accumulate experience, they typically passively gain extra Hit Points and Mana, as well as deal additional damage, but also usually gain other benefits as well, such as gaining access to new abilities or more powerful versions of the abilities they already possess; in many games, the player gets to choose which ability to make stronger at each level. However, the really critical resource tends to be money; while levels are very important, money allows a hero to buy items or other upgrades, which make them more powerful and sometimes grant them additional speed or special abilities they would otherwise lack. Unlike experience, money can only be spent when the hero returns to base (or respawns at base after their death), meaning that heroes must periodically retreat from the front lines in order to buy items or upgrades at their base, leaving temporary holes in their teams' defenses, but making them more powerful and better able to kill enemy minions and fight off enemy heroes.\nMany MOBAs have a few well-defined roles for heroes:\nAside from these generalized roles, MOBA characters and items can have similarities a lot they make up their own archetypes within the genre. Check here for such occurrences.\nLate in the game, after heroes have accumulated significant amounts of experience and money, they will typically take a more aggressive stance and start actively trying to destroy enemy towers, as well as try and gang up and destroy the special, more powerful monsters in the jungle to gain team-wide bonuses; frequently, this forces the enemy team to deploy against them in response. These situations where whole teams come into conflict are known as \"team fights\", and can frequently vastly shift the balance of power as multiple heroes from one team might be killed and forced to wait to respawn at base; a decisive team fight, where an entire team is trapped and eliminated, can frequently cost the eliminated team the game. Many games increase the amount of time a hero is forced to wait to respawn after they are killed later in the game, making such losses even more painful.\nWhile enemy heroes may have their own Hit Points, the health of your team as a whole is measured in its buildings. The core building, remember, is the Instant-Win Condition, and destroying it by any means, at any time, results in victory. Additionally, as you lose your outer towers, you lose map control; the Fog of War spreads, giving the enemy team more opportunities to ambush you. Finally, within your base are typically important buildings which, if destroyed, actually unlock extra mooks for the enemy team, tilting the game further in their favor.\nUnstable Equilibrium is a big factor in MOBAs. Early-game mistakes can result in one team or another gaining an early advantage, which makes it easier for them to win later confrontations, giving them a larger advantage with every victory. There are plenty of ways to hand your opponent advantages too, from starting a fight you can't win to failing to show up at a fight you could've, from being at the wrong place at the wrong time to being at the right place at the wrong time. The end result is that matches can often be decided long before either base is in even remote danger of destruction. Numbers are also critically important; at competitive levels of play, teams will often disengage after losing only one of their members, because their absence is already enough to virtually guarantee victory to the enemy team. Never Split The Party in a MOBA. Finally, because hero characters are (deliberately) limited in what they can bring to the table, a lack of teamwork can spell disaster. You might play a perfect game, execute everything correctly, avoid needless damage, get a ton of kills... and still lose, because someone on your team dropped their responsibilities. Even worse, if your team doesn\u2019t plan to do what you want them to, you might not be able to play your game at all; you may be forced to use your character to do things s/he isn\u2019t good at or even is designed to be bad at, leaving a sour taste in one\u2019s mouth\u2014even if said non-cooperative teammates go on to win the game (especially if).\nThe end result is that people can get really angry when playing a MOBA. Their communities are infamously toxic; they Suffer Newbies Poorly and blast weak team players. Many of these games have devoted communities to which the game in question is very much Serious Business, and due to the inherent difficulties in measuring the contribution of individual players on teams, matchmaking between individual players for pick-up games tends to lead to much more varied skill levels of players on a given team than for games with more individually-tailored rating systems, especially in games with five or more players on a side. This, plus the basics of human psychology, results in a recipe for G.I.F.T. and Griefing, and all of the DOTA clones, due to the relatively long matches and teamwork-centric game design, suffer from this to a great extent.\nTo mitigate the problem of having highly competitive people of variable skill levels, some of the newer MOBAs have tried to adopt different systems with varying levels of success, either by making it easier for the losing team to catch up or by making it so that matches end more quickly when one team gains a large advantage; both solutions are intended to give players less time to be unhappy with each other and to spend less time playing games where the outcome is already clear. In addition, most if not all the current MOBAs have some sort of player score-based matchmaking system, where all players have a personal score \u2014 usually known as \"Elo\" from the old days of League of Legends or \"matchmaking ranking\" (MMR) from present day Dota 2 \u2014 and joining the matchmaking queue will theoretically match you only with players with a score similar to yours, in order to guarantee that teams have a roughly even chance of winning.\nThese MOBA are very much playable and have a chance to be a fan favorite, except they tend to lay kind of low, either not attracting E-Sport scenes, or they're not out of alpha/beta phase yet. But they still live.\nMobile platforms has a vastly high adoption rate. Therefore, it was perfect ground for the wildly popular genre and several of the mobile MOBA games have gained a great deal of popularity.\nThe genre turns out to be a very harsh competition between producers, so there are some that ended up having their plugs pulled. Some of them managed to make themselves known before being put down though.\n"}

Unless...\nWell, unfortunately, some bosses don't play by these rules. Murder them in battle, and they'll just stand up again in a cutscene and say \"Wow, that was a fun fight! I haven't had this much fun in years!\" (And even worse, you're staggering or already collapsed regardless.) Other times, they will be visibly weakened, but will still be alive enough to say \"I Have Underestimated You, You Are A Worthy Opponent, This Is Not The End, We Will Meet Again, Villain: Exit, Stage Left\" Yet other times, they will be mortally wounded... but they'll somehow have enough strength left to give a 40-minute monologue as they die. Any of these situations can look really ridiculous if the enemy flashed away or exploded at the end of the in-game battle.\nAnd still other times, they'll stand back up and proceed to slaughter you; often this is used as a variant on a Hopeless Boss Fight.

{"HailfirePeaks": "A not-quite-original way of saving time or storage space, bringing some originality into the standard Video Game Settings: Take two stock settings and combine them into one. Bonus points if the two are diametric opposites. Triple word score if the two are actually Lethal Lava Land and Slippy-Slidey Ice World; the pervasiveness of this combination probably stems from the fact that these are the two level themes that can be definitely called \"opposites\" and the fact that Color Contrast between the two makes the level more visually interesting.

Necessary embellishments include:\nShowing a character as a galley slave is a quick-and-easy way to depict their suffering, as it combines all the bad parts of being a sailor with all the bad parts of slavery \u2014 that is to say, all of it.\nHistorically, this trope is Newer Than They Think and belongs in the realm of Briefer Than They Think. The heyday of the slave galley lasted only for some 70 years - from the beginning of the 16th century to the Battle Of Lepanto (1571). Galley slaves were introduced only during the Renaissance (16th century) as cannons became the main weapon of galleys instead of ramming and boarding and less skill was required for rowers. Slave galleys were uncommon in the ancient world for various reasonsnote\u00a0(see analysis page for details), making this trope an example of Artistic License \u2013 History.

Some, like Sweden and Russia, used conscript soldiers for galley crews.\nCompare Gladiator Games, the alternative for a male slave in ancient times.\n"}

No, not with possession, not through manipulation; we mean literally controlling your body, forcing you to move as he wishes, and turning you into his personal People Puppets.\nSuch a character, usually a villain, can control his victims' limbs as if they were marionettes on a set of strings. Sometimes he'll actually have a puppet-theme, and many a Demonic Dummy has powers like this to play on the irony of a person being puppet-ed by the puppets; but other times a character just happens to have this ability along with related Psychic Powers. In either case, those controlled will often move in Marionette Motion.\nEither way, he can manipulate others' bodies while they're still in 'em, much to his victims' dismay... as said victims are usually conscious, confused, and complaining (sometimes loudly, to inform allies \u2014 and the audience \u2014 that \"I ...can't... control my... body!\") Or maybe they Can Only Move the Eyes. Most times, they haven't been Brainwashed or anything, as they're protesting mightily \u2014 it's just that there's not much they can do about it.

This can be a spell, a weapon technique, a completely new type of ability, or a new crafting recipe. Sometimes the skill is vital to the progression of the story or core for the progression of the character, sometimes not.\nCompare Metroidvania games (which take the format of this trope plus Ability Required to Proceed) and Video Game Tutorial, which often uses this trope to feed players new techniques after they've proven they understand simpler ones.\nRelated to Skill Tree.

{"EnemyChatter": "Sometimes, to show that the enemies aren't just mindless NPCs whose sole purpose is to provide a threat to the player, the developers may throw in some dialogue here and there if the enemies can speak the same language as the hero. This can either be the dialog equivalent of a random encounter, in which they mindlessly babble from a handful of pre-selected phrases (i.e. \"Did you see anything?\"), or entire scripted sequences with full-blown dialog between two or more enemies.\nThey're still mindless NPCs whose sole purpose is to provide a threat to the player, but now they have personality, and the player may feel sorry about killing them (well, depending on circumstances, the dialogue might just as well establish the NPCs as being major Jerkasses anyway). Retirony may also be used to further hammer the point home. If the chatter shows how terrified the NPCs are of you, you're participating in a Mook Horror Show.\n"}
{"ExponentialPlotDelay": "The plots of some serial works can often take as much time getting to the three-quarter mark as they did getting to the half-way mark. And then as much time again on the next eighth. And so on. This phenomenon is known as Exponential Plot Delay, and it is a common trend among particularly long-running works.\nThe main storyline advances initially, but soon slows down until it all but comes to a halt. The rate at which Plot Coupons are collected drops dramatically, until it reaches a point where, for the A-story, Status Quo Is God. This can follow from the writer's understandable desire to avoid resolving the overarching plotline \u2014 the one that is providing the core tension sustaining the work. Other times, it's because the work has become popular enough to become a Cash Cow Franchise and either the writer or their management doesn't want the story to end \u2014 a lack of progress sometimes translates into good business.\nThere are several ways to make this work. First and foremost are sub-plots. And sub-sub-plots, etc. The advantage is twofold: sub-plots take the weight off the main plot and they provide an opportunity for storytelling in their own right. For maximum effect this trope is combined with multiple Plot Threads, advancing each sub-plot in turn. If too many threads are left unresolved, however, a Kudzu Plot may develop.\nAnother way to keep the A-story stable is the repeated discovery of The Man Behind the Man, often coupled with the Sorting Algorithm of Evil. As The Hero triumphs over a foe, he repeatedly finds out about an even worse foe out to get him. If all else fails, the writers can resort to filler. note\u00a0Use of the Reset Button is another technique, but not covered by this trope.\nA measure of caution must be taken when employing this trope, however. As the plot slows down, Arc Fatigue may make itself felt, and if it's done particularly badly, it may well lead to the audience giving up on the work, especially if years go by without the characters making any kind of meaningful progress in the main plot and it's determined that any attempt by the characters to make progress will meet with failure.\nAll series must end eventually, one way or the other. Sadly, some series are Cut Short; Real Life Writes the Plot and it's Left Hanging because of money problems and/or Author Existence Failure. Sometimes a series is not profitable enough to continue, but a short work is made to Wrap It Up. Other series end more naturally; the A-plot is taken out of the freezer, lightly microwaved with some lead-up and given a satisfying resolution.\nCompare and contrast Cosmic Deadline.\n"}
{"Expies": "An expy (short \"exported character\") is a character from one series who is unambiguously and deliberately based on a character in another, older series. A few minor traits, such as age or hair color, may change, but there's no doubt that they are almost one and the same. They often turn up in different works by the same writer(s) or production team.\nThis can simply be the tendency of writers to prefer certain characterizations for important characters (or knowing which ones are most marketable/popular), or the influence of the design process. On the other hand, it may just be a bad attempt to try to revive a character who the writer liked, but nobody else did and had to get rid of it. When by a different author, it may be an homage to the original creator and/or character. In the negative sense, an expy can be seen as just a bloated, gimmicky version of a perfectly serviceable past character. In a positive sense, it can refer to an \"upgrade\" of a two-dimensional or otherwise limited character to one more appreciably complex.\nRemember that Tropes Are Not Bad; an expy can give an old character concept a new lease on life, take it in a different direction, adapt it to a new medium, or simply do something with it that's as good or better than the original. Iconic characters like Yogi Bear and Mickey Mouse are obvious clones of Art Carney and Felix the Cat respectively, but that hasn't stopped them from being among the most acclaimed cartoon characters of all time.\nTheory: any Characters as Device trope, if taken to the extreme, can result in the character appearing to be a mere expy of the Trope Codifiers for that trope. Especially if the character is Flanderized to the point of having few defining characteristics outside of the trope they represent. See Fountain of Expies.\nMost often seen in animation and video games, where it's much easier to make a newer character resemble an older one. Occasionally happens when characters from different stories end up sharing voice actors, making or even forcing their personalities to look even more similar, which often leads to jokes based on the voice actor's former role.\nWhen the character appears in the same series as the previous character, they're often a Suspiciously Similar Substitute.\nThe key difference between this and Captain Ersatz is that an expy, while deliberately based on some other character, is still their own person, while Captain Ersatz is obviously the same character but with the Serial Numbers Filed Off. Please keep this distinction in mind before adding an example here. Also note that a fictional counterpart to a real-life person would not be an expy. When a character strongly resembles a real person, rather than a fictional character, that's No Celebrities Were Harmed. If the character is meant as an homage without being identical, it could be a Shout-Out instead. A quick glance around TV Tropes will reveal just how often these mistakes are made on this very wiki.\nRemember that an Expy must be a clearly deliberate reference on the part of the author; superficial or random coincidental similarities (even very striking ones) do not qualify, so if you aren't certain, they probably are not an Expy. Because many character archetypes and tropes that compose characters are universal, it is easy for readers to fall into thinking that a particular character in the same general archetype resembles someone from their favorite show or novel, especially when Small Reference Pools lead readers to overestimate the cultural impact of their favorite characters.\nSpiritual Successor is a similar trope scaled up to an entire work, and thus as a result often features Expies of characters from the original work.\nCompare to Bleached Underpants, Alternate Company Equivalent, Name's the Same, Roman \u00e0 Clef, Similar Squad, Same Story, Different Names, Suspiciously Similar Song, Distaff Counterpart, Surprisingly Similar Stories, Evil Counterpart, Whole Plot Reference. Not to be confused with XP, nor XP.\nContrast In Name Only, Transplanted Character Fic.\nFor specific characters that tend to inspire expies, see Fountain of Expies.

Everyone wonders once in a while \"If X and Y met, who would win in a fight?\" And whether you come up with incredibly thorough theories of your own, argue it with others, write a fanfic, or just resort to name-calling, everyone has their own opinion.\nSuch bouts between characters from different works will often involve one or more of the fighters being pulled into a different continuity, the strangers fighting for no logical reason and handicaps or caveats being introduced to make the fights more interesting. Also usually ends with the most popular of the combatants winning frequently due to the opponent conveniently not using his powers or resources to the fullest. Far more often, however, no one winning at all in order to avoid ticking off the loser's fanbase; this is typically accomplished by a common enemy appearing and thus allowing both characters to save face.\nCharacters commonly subjected to this include those identical or at least the same kind of character when compared to someone else and prominent characters in franchise or works with heavy amounts of Fandom Rivalry between them.\nOverlaps with Massive Multiplayer Crossover when more than 2 works are involved. If the characters end up in a relationship instead of fighting, it's a Crossover Ship. Characters discussing other characters in one of these battles is a Hypothetical Fight Debate. Compare to Character Tiers and Guest Fighter. See also Cool vs. Awesome. Contrast with Story-Breaker Team-Up.\nIf you were looking for the song, go here.\nATTENTION: The examples list is for matchups actually portrayed in media (including two characters having a \"who would win\" argument.) Matchups that you or the fandom would like to see? There's a forum for that!\n"}
{"LedgeBats": "An infamous class of enemies in Platform Games, that use Knockback to ruin your jumps, even when they are otherwise not that dangerous.\nEvery veteran gamer knows what it's like: You're jumping across a series of platforms ... and then you spot that little bird roosted on solid ground on the other side. There's a pretty good chance that the bird will completely spook and defend its terrain the moment you try to cross the last gap. Although your HP would be hardly worse off for what damage it can inflict, the main threat is that the aforementioned knockback. If you are really lucky, you may land back on the platform and get another chance to try again. But far more likely, you'll get knocked off these ledges entirely, usually leading to:\nThese guys can also come in the form of an Airborne Mook, flying right into you and knocking you backwards into the pit when you jump over it.\nOf course, if you have some kind of ranged attack at your disposal you may be able to dispatch the creature and make this jump in safety. Otherwise, you'll have to settle for striking it down in midair, and carefully time your attack to hit it before it can inflict its Collision Damage.\nSome games may double the challenge by putting these enemies in Gusty Glade.\nVery common in the arcade and 8 bit era, due to needing to keep the quarters pumping, and console games following that mold. 16 bit games began to phase them out, though they are still present in games.\nA Sub-Trope of Goddamned Bats. One of the Classic Video Game \"Screw You\"s. Compare to Instakill Mook when the pit is fatal to fall into as they have basically the same effect.\n"}
{"SeaStories": "A sea story is a work where the ocean is the primary setting. Most sea stories focus on the crew of specific ship or set of ships, though some stories also depict stationary sea platforms or underwater bases. Setting a story at sea adds an element of the exotic and adventurous to a story. The enclosed setting of life aboard a ship also allows an author to portray a social world in miniature, with characters cut off from the outside world and forced to interact in cramped and stressful conditions. They will invariably include one or more Tropes at Sea. Subgenres include Wooden Ships and Iron Men, Pirates, Ocean Punk and Sub Story, however many sea stories do not qualify any of these subgenres. For even more examples see The Other Wiki here and here.\nComicbooks\nFan Fiction\nFilm \u2014 Animation\nFilm \u2014 Live-Action\nLiterature\nLive-Action Television\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nVisual Novels\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"OffstageWaitingRoom": "Bob, Alice, and Chuck are in the middle of an epic journey to beat the Big Bad and prevent the The End of the World as We Know It, but, horror of horrors, Bob's powers aren't up to par. Three months and a Training Montage later, he comes back ready to kick some ass. But what were Alice, Chuck, and the Big Bad doing while Bob was away? Surely, there will have been some major changes while he was gone... Nope! They've just been sitting in the Offstage Waiting Room waiting for Bob to come back so they can get on with things.\nWhenever there's a Time Skip and one or more characters don't seem to have been doing anything during the break, they are said to have been waiting in the Offstage Waiting Room. This gets particularly noticeable when the Time Skip occurs in the middle of a Story Arc and they really should be doing something to advance the plot or otherwise prepare themselves, but they just... weren't. If these gaps are particularly noticeable, they may lead to some... interesting fan theories about what happened during the jump.\nCompare Offscreen Inertia, Time Skip, \"Not Important to This Episode\" Camp, and for games Take Your Time. Contrast Two Lines, No Waiting. Related to Rule of Perception.\n"}
{"HumanPet": "So the aliens have taken over the world. Or maybe they've captured us and taken us back to their home planet. Either way, they decide we're cute and cuddly and they're going to take us home and keep us. This can also apply with earthbound supernatural races like vampires or demons as well. The main component of the trope is that it's a work where humans are the pets of another species.\nOverlaps with Sapient Pet and This Is My Human. May overlap with Bond Creature or People Zoo.\nNot to be confused with the webseries The Human Pet.\n"}
{"PutOnaBus": "So you're a film or TV show producer or the author of a book series, or the team behind a comic book, and you have a problem. You want a character out of the story, but you don't want to kill them off, you're not going to just flat out ignore them, and you certainly wouldn't have them just disappear for no reason and with no mention of it. However, there is a situation in which a character can be written out of a series in such a way that they can easily be returned later, if the creators so choose. They are Put on a Bus.\nA staple of the Prime Time Soap and particularly Soap Opera where casts are large and actor turnover is frequent. Conveniently, when such a character is brought back and now played by a different actor, it can be a case of Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome or The Other Darrin. Often a case of Real Life Writes the Plot, due to actors leaving a franchise for various reasons.\nIf the character doesn't return from such a way that arranging a return would be simple, this becomes a Long Bus Trip. If they return once, it's The Bus Came Back. Should they start appearing infrequently, they're Commuting on a Bus or Out of Focus. If there's obvious malice involved in the character's departure, then they've been Put on a Bus to Hell. There's also the chance of a Bus Crash or dying on the bus.\nThe bus in question may be a Convenient Coma.\nOpposite of Dropped a Bridge on Him. Compare with Chuck Cunningham Syndrome (a character disappearing from the show without explanation and never being mentioned again) and What Happened to the Mouse? (where the story continues with a character's final fate left unknown). See also Absentee Actor and Written-In Absence, for when a character disappears for only an episode or two.\n"}
{"DemonicSpiders": "Demonic Spiders: the bane of players everywhere. These are the enemies that will make you scream in fury (or quake in fear) each time you see them. These are the guys which will defeat you over and over again using tactics that just seem unfair at times.\nThe defining trait of Demonic Spiders is that they are common enemies that seem unfairly powerful, not bosses. These are not dangerous because they distract from something else, they are likely what kills you when you're distracted. They are not dangerous because they push you into hazards, they are already enough of a hazard by themselves.\nDemonic Spiders are the enemies that, for lack of a better phrase, have the deck stacked in their favor. They have more Hit Points, they go swifter, they come in swarms, attacking them deals damage to you, etc. Basically, these are the enemies with annoying abilities granted to them by the programmers that make them exponentially more dangerous than any other random enemy, but unlike the Boss in Mook Clothing these are quite common.\nDemonic Spiders are usually made up of at least one of the following characteristics:\nUnintentional examples may be a product of poor playtesting; however, intentional examples do exist. Sometimes the intention isn't so much to fight them as avoid them or hope they go away. They may appear during a Stealth-Based Mission to justify the need to sneak around them rather than fighting them. Most enemies in Horror Games tend to be Demonic Spiders to some degree.\nAs usual, Tropes Are Not Bad. If a game doesn't have at least one or two enemies you have any reason to fear, then it may not be challenging enough to be fun.\nCan overlap with Goddamned Bats. Particularly if RPG Elements are present, Demonic Spiders can become Goddamned Bats as characters level up. Compare: That One Boss, Contrast: Boss in Mook Clothing who tend not to be so common, and Ledge Bats who are dangerous for more indirect reasons. Ironically enough, can overlap with Breather Boss as despite being a tough and annoying field enemy, when used as a boss is a cakewalk by boss standards. Not to be confused with Giant Spider, which is more about literal spiders, although both can overlap.\n"}
{"BodyArmorAsHitPoints": "In the context of some video games, sometimes body armor just provides a bonus to the owner's maximum Hit Points. Rather than add any kind of specific protection to certain attacks, a character wearing body armor will just gradually have it chipped away whenever they are hit, in the same manner as their usual hit points. If enough damage is sustained, the extra body armor may simply vanish.\nIt is not usually visible on a character, and acquiring it puts the object to use instantaneously, so the player character is never seen discarding it. This trope is, obviously, not particularly realistic. Ironically, it became popular with many \"realistic\" shooters because putting on body armor seemed a more plausible way of improving a character's hit points than having them grab a first aid kit and immediately gain the benefits from using one in the middle of a firefight. Generally necessary for the sake of game mechanics, although this is less true today than it was ten years ago.\nA variation of this which generally is considered to make more sense is Full-body Deflector Shields As Hit Points. After all, energy which specifically covers your entire person and uses energy to protect should be able to help protect you from anything as long as its energy supply is sufficient, right?\nPossibly a bit of Truth in Television or videogames rather. Interceptor body armor for the most part stops bullets outright but breaks down after soaking up about three hits, making it effectively a free-couple-bullets-to-the-chest-before-you-die card. A single high caliber shot renders it basically useless, and about five pistol shots breaks it too. Steel is hilariously tanky of small caliber shots, all the way to light machine guns, but high caliber shots go right through. The newest ceramic armors now take somewhere around 10 5.56 hits to break, and you get less internal damage.\nCompare Call a Hit Point a \"Smeerp\", Clothing Damage. Using this system rather than making armour a separate stat Armor Piercing Attacks can circumvent may help avert Armor Is Useless.\n"}
{"LyricDissonance": "So, you're listening to this new song. Nice and bouncy, sounds like it's gonna be a fun little ditty. Then the lyrics start. You might be happily sing along to the catchy melody for a little bit, before it starts in: The singer is actually telling a woeful tale about miserable subjects, including struggling with depression, descend into insanity, committing murder, committing suicide, witnessing the end of civilization and the downfall of mankind, and being a victim of line-cutting.\nAnd the worst part is, the happy, upbeat music just keeps going. That's Lyrical Dissonance: when the music and lyrics are going in opposite directions. Happy upbeat lyrics set to sad music also qualifies. This can also be used for comic effect, either by putting serious, dramatic music to silly lyrics, or by simply treating the subject matter as if it did fit the tune. This trope also applies with lyrics that seem unfitting for reasons other than happiness versus sadness - for instance, a particularly angry or violent-sounding song that has lyrics that are clearly humorous, or sad, or perhaps just thoughtful and introspective; or the reverse, a cheery tune with angry or violent lyricsnote\u00a0such as this humorous arrangement of a brutal death metal song.\nA rather old trope. One of the archetypal examples involves an evil chief of police plotting to blackmail a woman into having sex with him in order to save the man she loves, then having the man killed anyway, while all around him parishioners beg for God's mercy, all set to some of the most gorgeously beautiful music the composer ever wrote. That's from Puccini's 1900 opera, Tosca. Not the oldest by any means \u2014 but one that can easily compete with most of the examples below.\nSub-trope to Mood Dissonance. Compare to Soundtrack Dissonance and The Mel Brooks Number, where the upbeat showtune melody is used for ribald or sarcastic effect. May lead to Isn't It Ironic?, if the song is used in a place where the people who selected it didn't listen to the lyrics very well. As one of the folders in this page shows, it might be related to The Cover Changes the Meaning.\n"}
{"OffScreenRomance": "Two characters are, as far as the audience are concerned, not romantically involved with each other. Maybe they're Just Friends, co-workers, or perhaps even strangers. Then those characters get Put on a Bus, or become Out of Focus, or maybe the story gets a Time Skip. And when the audience see those two characters again, they're already together, maybe even married.\nBasically, this is an inversion of an Offscreen Breakup, where the writers can justify pairing the two people together without having to dedicate a Romance Arc around them. It is commonly invoked to prevent a Romantic Plot Tumour (if the story is not centered around romance), but could also lead to accusations of Strangled by the Red String if not handled carefully.\nCompare Married in the Future, where characters who are already in a relationship consolidate their ties after a Time Skip or in an Alternate Universe, and Last Minute Hookup, where characters are abruptly paired off in the finale, but the upgrade doesn't necessarily have to happen off-screen.\nNote: This trope only counts when the couple has a Relationship Upgrade in mid-story. It doesn't qualify if they are introduced as a couple from the get-go.\n"}
{"SchoolgirlSeries": "A subgenre of Slice of Life, Schoolgirl Series tend to revolve around a group of female classmates and their antics and adventures during and after school. Depending on how comedic they are, such series may feature a rather unusual school where highly unrealistic things happen. Having a Manchild teacher in control of a Wacky Homeroom is not uncommon in Schoolgirl Series though a Straight Man educator may be swapped in to form a contrast with the outrageous behavior of the main heroines. A Sensei-chan character may be thrown into the mix in order to incorporate some kind of friendly adult perspective.\nSchoolgirl Series can also have more serious or romantic elements, but are similar in how their main focuses are on the day-to-day activities of a group of girls in school and the friendships that grow through them. Sometimes there is a main heroine in the story and if that is the case, the series may have some Coming of Age elements.\nMale characters may appear, but they rarely enter into the main cast and if they do they are outnumbered by female ones. Occasionally, this element is used to such a degree that one may wonder why Everybody Is Single and yet people rarely mention relationships or dating in many of the more comedy-centered Schoolgirl Series.\nIn Japan, these kinds of series often overlap with Moe and almost always have men as their target demographic. Even so, Schoolgirl Series rarely delve into Fanservice. Though the anime-centric language may lead you to believe otherwise, the schoolgirl genre is also present in the West, with 1931 German film M\u00e4dchen in Uniform the Ur-Example.\n"}
{"VignetteEpisode": "An episode in a normal series that is composed of two or more vignettes. Most times they are unrelated, or only held together by a Framing Device or a common theme. Happens when a writer wants to try Something Completely Different.\nNote that this only counts for shows that normally have a single, cohesive plot. For example, The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show doesn't count, because all the episodes are a series of shorts.\nA literary approximation happens when a book series whose novels generally have only one story release an anthology of short stories about the series universe.\nAs for video games, this happens when a game has multiple modes with each individual mode having its own story. While they tend be connected in the grand scheme of things, the player will often have freedom in choosing how they tackle all the modes. Alternatively, the game could play just like a TV episode where the storyline is composed of multiple, individual storyline that the player will be transferred between as they progress through the game.\nContrast Three Shorts, Two Shorts and Animated Anthology. Compare Anthology Film.\n"}

{"MurderArsonAndJaywalking": "When listing three or more things, the comedy rule is to not finish strong, but to list some strong examples followed by a very weak example, for the funny. Sometimes this will stick to the Rule of Three, but sometimes a longer list will increase the humor.\nIn the US and Canada, \"jaywalking\" means crossing the road in a dangerous manner, particularly ignoring the crosswalks when crossing city streets. In many other countries, not only are there almost no restrictions on where you can cross, but the idea of someone being fined for crossing the road is alien. In places where jaywalking is illegal, it's usually an infraction (i.e. like a parking ticket) rather than a proper criminal offense, and some cities don't even bother to enforce it.\nSee also: List of Transgressions, Arson, Murder, and Lifesaving, Felony Misdemeanor, Good News, Bad News, Odd Name Out, The Triple. Compare Poke the Poodle, All Crimes Are Equal, Jaywalking Will Ruin Your Life, when the minor crime carries significant consequences. The inverse is Bread, Eggs, Milk, Squick, where a list of seemingly mundane things ends with something much darker. Clue, Evidence, and a Smoking Gun is a related inverse that deals with deductions rather than listing things. Sub-Trope of The Last of These Is Not Like the Others.\n"}
{"KiAttack": "A staple of the martial arts genre. Ki (or chi or qi in Chinese; traditional Chinese: \u6c23, simplified Chinese: \u6c14, Japanese: \u6c17) is the life force energy (and, to a lesser extent, emotions/disposition) of the martial artist and/or the world around him; true masters can tap into that energy directly and use it for what amounts to superhero-style attacks. Compare Chi with Mana.\nSometimes Ki is divided into subtypes associated with particular kinds of environments or supernatural beings, the most common example being some kind of demonic Ki which has properties of Mana and acts as The Dark Side (often called \"youki\", as in Youkai Ki). In some works only this special Ki is used, with regular human Ki being either non-existent or just too weak to do anything with.\nIf Functional Magic also exists in the 'verse, there's usually a distinction made between the two, comparable to the distinction between Psychic Powers and Functional Magic in Western Speculative Fiction. If no distinction is made, it's Supernatural Martial Arts. If a character can use both individually, then they're a Kung-Fu Wizard. At times may overlap with Background Magic Field. Sometimes Ki Manipulation is a part of some Martial Arts and Crafts, making it either Rule of Funny or Rule of Cool.\nHaving a large amount of Ki will usually produce a Battle Aura.\nCommon types of Ki Manipulation include:\nMay be represented with Blasting Time. See also Hand Blast, an attack which is similar in appearance.\n"}
{"AnnualTitle": "When a show's title incorporates the year it was released \u2014 more or less. Forward-dating shows by using next year is somewhat common, especially if the release is late in the year. Back-dating is less heard of, since it implies the show is falling behind the times; usually annual titles get incremented in case production slips behind schedule.\nAffixing a contemporary year to the title of a familiar story often implies a Setting Update, though not necessarily.\nFans will often do this with Similarly Named Works and Recycled Titles. Since those are Retronyms rather than official, they may or may not have their place here.\nCompare Title by Number and Trope 2000.\n"}
{"WesternUnionMan": "\"Western Union\" man, not western \"union man\".\nThe telegraph operator in The Western, generally wears a white shirt, suspenders and a green eyeshade. The telegraph office is in the railroad station; while owned by two separate companies, they have a symbiotic relationship (in Real Life, the telegraph lines and railroad ran side-by-side between towns all over the country). May or may not employ one or more young boys to deliver incoming messages to in-town businesses and homes\u2014if not, everyone else in town has to go to the office to pick up incoming telegrams. Since messages can arrive at any time, the Western Union man himself is seldom seen outside the office. Unlike his Pony Express predecessor, tends to be a Meek Townsman. Sometimes gets to Take a Level in Badass if the train station gets robbed.\nThe Western Union corporation provided most of the telegraph service in the United States from the 1850s to 2006. The long period of obsolescence\u2014again, WU discontinued telegram service in 2006, a scant two years before the iPhone was launched\u2014masks just how bleeding-edge the technology was when introduced. It was a major development for human communication, the first time ever information could travel faster than it could be physically carried on a written note (beyond the radius practical for line-of-sight means like semaphore or smoke signals). The Western Union Man is the forerunner of all geekdom.\nLive Action Television\n"}
{"HarbingerOfAssKicking": "Drama usually has a signal for the audience just before a big dramatic Fight Scene. Something that says \"Pay Attention! Exciting battle ahead\". Can prelude asskicking by either the Hero or by the Villain, although usually it's done for the Hero.\n"}
{"FirstGirlAfterAll": "First Girl After All is a narrative technique of concealing a character's first Love Interest for as long as possible until the moment when it's most dramatically shocking to the audience, usually at or near the climax of the plot. This is accomplished either by never making it clear who the First Girl is, or by misleading the audience into believing that another character is the First Girl.\nAfter much of the story, we approach The Reveal, the Final Battle, the Grand Finale, or some other tense moment, and it seems like the \"Second Girl\" in the Love Triangle (or Last Girl in the Love Dodecahedron) is going to win. But something suddenly \"clicks\", and the story reveals that they first met when they were children! But wait! This could only have possibly happened BEFORE he met the First Girl. This can only mean that the girl everyone thought was the Second Girl is the First Girl After All.\nMost likely a subversion of Last Girl Wins and Double Subversion of First Girl Wins, used to embrace it without giving the romantic resolution away to the audience. In a romance plot, this can be considered a Plot Twist if this happens before a romantic resolution is reached.\nThe trope can also be used as a Continuity Nod if this is revealed after they get together, such as bumping shoulders in a hallway during a flashback that was on screen for a completely different reason, an encounter which can have the byproduct of being this trope.\nRelated tropes include Love Triangle, Love Dodecahedron, First Girl Wins, Forgotten Childhood Friend, and Childhood Friend Romance, any of which may be involved, as well as either a Flashback or a Prequel.\nAs this is generally only revealed toward the very end, the example list is generally filled with spoilers and potentially ending spoilers.

{"UpMarketing": "You've created a wonderful product for your company. It's practically top of the line. It's reliable, sturdy, comes with a lot of great features, and everyone loves its design.\nHowever, all this quality comes at a price. Namely... well, price. It costs too much for the mainstream market to afford it. What do you do?\nWell, you have two choices. The first choice is to sell the product at a loss, so that the mainstream can afford it. This is only advisable if it's sold with another product profitable enough to offset that loss, which is the old \"Give away the razors to sell the blades\" strategy. The second choice is to not bother with the mainstream at all. Instead go for as much of the market that can afford it. This is known as the upmarket.\nOf course the upmarket doesn't just go for anything. They have to feel they are getting their money's worth. So instead of just a hook for people to remember the product, you need the upmarket to feel your product is worth their money. There are three common methods of doing this.\nMore shadily, this method of selling may be invoked by an Honest John-type Con Man who artificially marks up prices in an attempt to part a fool and his new money. After all, if it's very expensive, it must be very valuable, right?\nThis doesn't always go for the upper classes. Anyone with a decent salary and an expensive hobby can be the upmarket for that hobby.

We will hear everyone's concerns as they whisper back and forth.\nIf the audience is not privy to the huddle, we will instead see a far shot of everyone squished together.

{"PowerPalms": "Power Palms is the placement of something important on or in someone's palms. This can be something supernatural or technical: a map, a release for special powers, or something of that sort.\nIf defensive, this may be because of its similarity to the \"stop\" hand motion. If knowledge-based, this may be because of Buddhist influence, requesting openness.\nRelated to Power Fist and Hand Blast. This power could potentially be the cause of Offhand Backhand, and is often used to execute the dreaded Face Palm Of Doom. Not related to A Date with Rosie Palms.\n"}
{"TheMovingExperience": "A plotline, seen in some children's cartoons, where the main character's best buddy overhears his parents saying that he's moving, thinking that he or she is actually moving to another town. As a result, the subject says goodbye to everyone and makes everyone miss the subject (don't expect anyone not to miss them and/or actually celebrate the departure). Sometimes the subject even runs away from home to stay with his friends. However, the person actually finds out that he or she's actually moving to another room, resulting in a happy Snap Back ending. Alternatively, they may just be moving across the street or may not actually be moving anywhere at all, but the point is that the characters get the idea in their heads that someone is moving to another town, but they're not.\nIf the show is a comedy or generally of a comedic bent, then expect the situation to be played for great giggles, generally at the expense of the character who believes that someone is moving away. If the show is generally of a more serious nature, however, then the show may aim to tug at the viewers' heartstrings, even though this plotline is typically a form of Dramatic Irony, as the viewers are usually fully aware that the character in question is not, in fact, moving away. Often the result of Out-of-Context Eavesdropping.\nCompare Last Day to Live, and With a Foot on the Bus.\nNote: Due to the basic nature of this trope, expect unmarked spoilers in the examples.\n"}
{"HeartBeatdown": "In a nutshell, a character who uses Love as one of their Elemental Powers.\nA character with this power is fueled by or themed around innocence, love, beauty, attraction or lust. Because these are more feelings than a proper element, the abilities of the user will have to do a lot with their personality and the general tone of the series. The user is almost Always Female and likely to be The Heart of the team.\nThe signature and tell tale sign that this element is at work is when a character makes Heart Symbols show up during their moves, or if they take the place of sparks, stars and explosions during physical impacts.\nIf they do their own fighting, expect their style to be very feminine. They tend to be associated with slap attacks and dance moves, and suggestive butt attacks and kissing attacks.\nIf they're not the fighting type, a character with this element will use Intimate Healing or the Kiss of Life. May be able to purify their opponents and empower their allies or seduce and hypnotize them. Usually through magic or weapons that act like concentrated Love Potions or hyper potent pheromones in more 'realistic' settings.\nWith rare exception, good or evil, the character will be very attractive. Male examples are usually only played straight if their girlfriends are nearby. Otherwise they'll be Played for Laughs or as Fan Disservice.\nSub-Trope of The Power of Love. Sister Trope to Holy Hand Grenade. Super Trope to Projectile Kiss.\nUsually the powers of a Love Goddess\nCompare Care-Bear Stare, The Power of Love, Heart Is an Awesome Power, What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway?. See also Super Cute Super Powers (this tends to look cute, but it's not really a subtrope, since this concept is \"weaponized power of love\").\nHas nothing to do with using a heart as an Improvised Weapon to apply a No-Holds-Barred Beatdown.\n"}
{"CutYourHeartOutWithASpoon": "This trope is when a threat \u2014 usually a death threat \u2014 is Played for Laughs by being a bit, well, odd. This can include a threat that's unnecessarily long and convoluted, and the one making it gets a bit lost; or a threat that simply incorporates some really bizarre elements; or a pathetically nonthreatening sort of threat (\"Do X, or I'll... give you some really evil looks when your back is turned!\").\nSometimes, Fridge Horror makes the more bizarre elements even more terrifying and Squickier. It's one thing to threaten someone with a sharp knife or even a gun; those cut pretty quickly and can be almost painless (at first; ever heard of the term \"clean cut\"?). However, going after someone with a spoon dictates hours of potential digging into a person very crudely to get the same effect.\nRusty and/or dull cutlery seems to be a particular favorite, though.\nThis trope is usually seen in comedy, for obvious reasons. See also Cool and Unusual Punishment or Cruel and Unusual Death, for when these bizarre threats are actually effective. To the Pain is usually invoked if played seriously, \"I'll Kill You!\" when it's not so convoluted. \"I Will Tear Your Arms Off!\" is a specific Sub-Trope. Freudian Threat for when the threat focuses specifically on a character's naughty bits. Compare Once Killed a Man with a Noodle Implement.\n"}
{"UnwillingRobotization": "Science fiction often portrays cybernetics as the way forward. Replacing lost limbs, augmenting abilities, even allowing body transplants. But on occasion, a story involves characters who don't want to surrender their fleshy bodies. And that can be handy to know for a villain. This is normally done by dictator and other control freak types. This can be to suppress rebellion, to remove individuality, or to create a robot army \u2013 or a combination of the above.\nThis can be similar to You Will Be Assimilated. Related to Cybernetics Eat Your Soul. Can sometimes be portrayed as a very special kind of Body Horror, akin to zombification (especially in cases where the procedure begins with brain harvesting). Also see We Can Rebuild Him and Emergency Transformation.\nSome devices that inflict roboticisation use nanomachines, resulting in graphic scenes of the person being slowly mechanized while screaming in pain as they are being rebuilt into machines. May be resisted with Heroic Willpower. May lead to Sheep in Wolf's Clothing. See also Man in the Machine and Hypno Trinket. Compare and contrast Brain Uploading.\n"}
{"GoodnessEqualsBeauty": "If a character is beautiful, then that character is a good person, either publicly or secretly. If a character is good, then that character will either be beautiful or be treated as beautiful.\nOr to put it another way, every hero worth his salt must be physically attractive, or at the very least, better-looking than half of other people his or her age. This standard is more relaxed for side characters who can be truly ordinary-looking or even literal aliens, but expect the lead character to be pleasing to look at, even if he is the alien.\nIt almost goes without saying that this is very old; Ancient Greece codified it with the concept of \"cosmos\" (from which we get the term cosmetics), and an attempt was even made in the 19th Century to quantify this attitude into the \"science\" of physiognomy, which posited a direct correlation between appearance and moral character.\nThis trope's influence is felt on many others:\nThe failed subversion of Suetiful All Along is common.\nFor animals and more nonhuman characters, see What Measure Is a Non-Cute?.\nCompare Evil Makes You Ugly. The opposite of this trope is Beauty Is Bad and Evil Is Sexy, although they aren't mutually exclusive with this one. Ugly Hero, Good-Looking Villain is a specific inversion. Contrast Divinely Appearing Demons and Face of an Angel, Mind of a Demon. See also Expecting Someone Taller.\nAs this trope is ubiquitous, please only add egregious cases. Invoked and defied examples are the best ones.\n"}
{"GirlsNightOutEpisode": "An episode of a show where all the male characters are absent, focusing on the main female characters instead. If the ladies aren't particularly close, such as a Tomboy and Girly Girl dynamic, the circumstances forcing them to work together could lead to mutual respect, and possibly a friendship lasting the rest of the series.\nIf the genre is action or a superhero, then the plot often involves the heroines having to rescue the heroes, usually with all female villains as well.\nA Sub-Trope of A Day in the Limelight, which covers any example of an episode where the focus is on a smaller part of the cast than usual. Might happen while the men are having a Stag Party. See also Macho Disaster Expedition.\nIf the Girl's Night Out is simply the A plot of the episode and the remaining male cast receives a good portion of the B plot of the episode, then it's a Gender-Separated Ensemble Episode instead.\n"}
{"TabletopGames": "Tabletop games are games which don't involve physical competition (separating them from sports) or electronic devices (separating them from Video Games). It's generally agreed that a tabletop game must involve some physical objects, otherwise it would be a Parlor Game. A table is not required, however; most tabletop games can also be played sitting on the floor or standing up, but a table is usually the most convenient option.\nThere are many different categories of tabletop games, including:\nAnd then there are lots of games that don't fit into any of these categories very well, from Mahjong to Connect Four.\nOf course, the variety in gameplay is also enormous. Two aspects in which tabletop games can differ quite significantly are hidden information and random elements. For example, in chess, there is no hidden information and no randomness; everything is determined by the players' own actions, and everything in the game is revealed to both players. In Stratego and Diplomacy, there are no random elements either, but the amount of hidden information is huge, and deceiving your opponent(s) is an important part of gameplay. In the Game of the Goose, there is no hidden information, but the randomness is turned Up to Eleven \u2013 everything is random, and players have zero control over the outcome of the game. Poker is a good example of a game that features both random elements (which cards you are dealt) and hidden information (your opponents' hands). Most games likewise have a little of both. There also exist games which incorporate other media in addition to the base content of the game, such as those which involve a VHS tape or DVD to display in tandem with the physical game, introducing further elements and events during play.\nRecently, Wil Wheaton has promoted the board game hobby with his web series, Tabletop, where he and several 'geek celebrities' (famous geeks and people involved in cult nerd shows and projects, oftentimes both) play a variety of board games, from Settlers of Catan to Ticket to Ride to the Dragon Age tabletop RPG campaign. It can be watched here as well as from YouTube, and has gone through two seasons at the time of this writing.\nSee Tabletop Game Tropes for tropes that apply to tabletop games and Game Tropes for a more general index.\n"}
{"TheStraightMan": "Somebody has to set up the joke so the funny guy can deliver the punchline. That's the Straight Man. He rarely gets the funny lines, but has to have impeccable timing and delivery so that the comic (the other half of a comedy duo) can hit it out of the park. Bud Abbott (widely considered the greatest Straight Man of all time) had to say, \"Who's on First,\" with just the right degree of earnestness and irritation so that Lou Costello could get big laughs saying \"Whaddya askin' me for?\"\nThe best Straight Men are so good they can sometimes get laughs just by delivering a straight line so well the audience knows what's coming. (This is essentially the basis of Bob Newhart's \"telephone\" routines: he was playing the Straight Man to nothing.) Other straight men in comedy duos have included George Burns (with Gracie Allen), Dean Martin (with Jerry Lewis), and Dan Rowan (with Dick Martin of Laugh-In).\nIn less-comedic works, the Straight Man is a Foil for the Bunny-Ears Lawyer, Magnificent Bastard or Loveable Rogue.\nIf the Straight Man is the lead in an ensemble or a show with Loads and Loads of Characters, this can lead to them being overshadowed by the rest of the cast because they spend their time and effort setting up the rest of the cast instead of themselves (see also Standardized Leader).\nThe term can apply to women, but \"comedic foil\" is a more popular unisex term. In fact women in comic pairings have frequently played this role over the last few decades usually with Women Are Wiser coming into play.\nIn TV comedy, a Straight Man is frequently one half of an Odd Couple. In a Comic Trio, they usually play the \"helpless observer\" role. If multiple characters take turns playing Straight Man, they have a game of Sanity Ball. By far the most common pairing is Straight Man and Wise Guy.\nNot to be confused with:\nCompare and contrast:\nA Straight Man need not necessarily be heterosexual nor even male, as many examples on this page show.\n"}
{"ActionAdventure": "A subgenre of both the Action Game and Adventure Game genres, the Action-Adventure game was effectively created by such titles as The Legend of Zelda and Metroid back in the days of the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System. These two titles are recognised as archetypical of the genre, and since then, the Action Adventure has expanded to include games in a wide variety of thematic genres, as well as appearing on every video game platform around. The essential traits of an action adventure are considered to include reflex-based gameplay, an action game element, combined with item collecting, environment exploration and puzzle solving, which are associated with the adventure game genre. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, the Action Adventure is sometimes used as a catch all for games that do not overtly suit any one genre but still have a plot, a usage which some consider erroneous.\nThe action adventure is exemplified in games that have large and detailed worlds to explore, a range of options in terms of possible actions and some level of non-linearity in terms of plot, but this last aspect is often sacrificed, in whole or in part, on the altar of budgets and/or writers. This lack of large-scale non-linearity is what differentiates the Action-Adventure game from a Wide Open Sandbox, though there are other minor, but important, differences. This level of non-linearity is a characteristic the action adventure shares with the RPG, though it usually doesn't have experience points or levels \u2014 character improvments, if any, are only ever the result of gaining new items or upgrading old ones. The key here is that in an action adventure a character either has an ability or he or she doesn't; there is no measure of how good he or she is with a given ability (which is considered an RPG element).\nAs a rule of thumb, an Action-Adventure game is distinguished from those of closely related genres, such as Platformers, Action Games and Adventure Games by its combination of but lack of commitment to any one of these genres. It contains reflex gameplay, which adventure games do not; puzzle solving, which action games do not; and jumping puzzles, which both adventure games and action games generally do not. Action-Adventure games also seldom, if ever, have \"Extra Lives\" (though there may be items that stop you from dying, such as the fairies in The Legend of Zelda), with the distinction between \"fairies\" and extra lives being that one has an \"in-game\" explanation and one is completely arbitrary. As indicated by the above description, the genre is a very broad one and hard to nail: Ben Croshaw once observed that the term in some ways has become a blanket label for any game that's hard to classify.\nAs the plot of these games becomes less and less Excuse Plot and more and more developed, this genre has become increasingly similar to the Role-Playing Game genre. A general rule of thumb for telling them apart: In RPGs, you are in a dungeon because of the plot, whereas in Action-Adventure games, you are in a plot because of the dungeon.\nMost Licensed Games not on a portable console have this type of gameplay.\nSee Metroidvania for a particular sub-genre.\n"}
{"GenderSwapped": "\"Gender Swapped\" can mean several things. You may be looking for:\n"}
{"ReconcileTheBitterFoes": "Two groups have been locked in a Forever War for a long, long time. Then, a third party (like The Hero) comes along and wants something from both of them. But first he has to play the peacemaker and stop the senseless bloodshed for them to work together with each other and with him.\nSuccess usually results in a very, very awkward but hopefully honest (just how awkward and honest will depend on whether Ontological Inertia factors in or not) handshake between the two leaders and a Moment of Awesome for The Hero.\nCompare Young Love Versus Old Hate, which can overlap with this (cf. Romeo and Juliet) but not necessarily, and Velvet Revolution, when a conflict that started off violently immediately winds down peacefully.\n"}
{"RedundantDepartmentOfRedundancy": "Describe Department Of Redundancy Department Here by writing a description of Department of Redundancy Department.\nWhen listing things, a character will repeat an item. Might end with \"Did I mention X already?\" when making a list. Common ways for it to show up are a list going \"A, B, C, B, D, B, E... and did I mention B?\" and \"You said X twice.\" \"I like X.\" These occur frequently, especially when listing things.\nThis also shows up frequently with the misuse of acronyms, specifically when part of the acronym is used next to the acronym itself. The Other Wiki knows this as RAS Syndrome (i.e. Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome).\nWith some websites and occasionally in Real Life, the Department of Redundancy Department is referred to as an actual organization run by Captain Obvious with a side branch called the Branch of Awkward Wording (or, for bonus points, the Branch Of Awkward Wording Branch).\nThe Firesign Theatre gets credit for naming this trope on their classic 1970 album \"Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers\", the album where the trope name comes from.\nCompare Shaped Like Itself; Broken Record; Repetitive Name; Bread, Eggs, Breaded Eggs; Captain Obvious; Hurricane of Euphemisms. Cluster F-Bomb is generally this trope applied to swearing, where people swear over a swearing word.\nDisclaimer: The D.R.D.

{"BioArmor": "There's Powered Armor, and then there's this, the Organic Technology equivalent.\nLeaving aside the fact that you're essentially wrapping a living being around yourself, it often forms some sort of symbiotic connection with the wearer, often drawing nutrients from the wearer's blood. Needless to say that might have adverse side effects. An even worse version might be sentient, and capable of taking over.\nMight be worn by a Heroic Host. Might sometimes be able to turn into an Animated Armor. Subtrope of Organic Technology. Compare Living Weapon, a creature used as a weapon; and Living Clothes, clothing that has a mind of its own, though it may not necessarily be an actual organism in itself.\n"}
{"MascotMook": "Most Mooks exist solely to die en masse at the hero's hands. Some become emblematic of the series in the process.\nThe Mascot Mook combines the ubiquitous nature of a Mook with the iconic appeal of a Mascot, and despite lacking Nominal Importance these guys have become spotlight stealers among the game's bestiary.\nPerhaps there's something memorable about their design or behavior. Maybe they are one the more basic and common enemies so their presence becomes a part of the series' setting. Maybe they are so cute or goofy that the player can't help but smile every time one of them pops up \u2014 despite how often they will suddenly pop up or how many of them the player will slaughter throughout the game.\nWhatever the case, these Mooks have somehow become just as vital to the series as a whole as your core party members are to the narrative of each separate installment. Fans silently expect these guys to appear somewhere in each and every installment (often in multiple versions), simply because they always have, and no new game would be fit for release without their appearance.\nWhile this trope is most prevalent in video games, it is by no means exclusive to them; Stormtroopers, Zakus, Daleks, and Minions are some iconic non-video game examples.\nOften a Series Mascot. Frequently, but not always, The Goomba. Sometimes the popularity of the Mascot Mook can result in spin-off titles (and other products) dedicated entirely to them; see Breakout Mook Character. See Recurring Element for non-monster examples.\n"}
{"ThinkInText": "A common problem faced by many writers is how to convey thought or telepathic \"speech\" in text. After all, the written word doesn't lend itself to all those convenient editing tricks used in voice-overs for film, music or radio. Yes, that famous slightly hollow sound is the one we're thinking of, here.\nStandard dialogue with \"s/he thought\" tacked on just gets... repetitive when it happens often. Even if the author has done a really good job trying to avoid it by hitting ''Roget's Thesaurus'' hard for inspiration. The problem is, it hardly stands out from ordinary dialogue. Hence, this trope happened as a shorthand. Or, just a break from boredom.\nThink in Text is, therefore, a distinctive subtrope of Painting the Medium and sister trope of Translation Convention mixed with Unconventional Formatting. It's very closely related to Inner Monologue in some way, as well, especially when its tricks have been used there.\nSeveral ways to use the textual paint palette have had to evolve for the thunken word. And, here they are. (Obviously, these refer mostly to texts written in the English language; other languages might have their own rules or standard ways to format thoughts.)\nItalics rule the roost. So predominant is the italic option, it's become a convention! Listing all the examples of works that use standard dialogue, but, in italics, would take forever. So please, don't even start thinking about it.note\u00a0Betcha you did\u2014and you've come up with three already, with more on the way, right?\nBut, as in all things, just using a single method is not to everybody's taste. Some like to hold the quotation marks and just go with the italics. Others mix and match what they use, when, depending whether a character is just thinking, inner monologuing or actively broadcasting telepathically. Done well, this can really work and blends into the background.\nItalics lend themselves to Think in Text because, well, just look at them. Not as substantial-looking as normal type, are they? Also, their go-faster, slanty-look just lends itself to thoughts.\nHowever, this very look makes them difficult to read, sometimes. This is the main reason why comics and manga try to avoid this if at all possible and usually play with their bubbles instead. See Bold Inflation, Speech Bubble, Thought Bubble and Thought Caption for related tropes.\nSo, if any writer wants to avoid the italic, they can play other games with the textnote\u00a0They can hit on something no easier to read than the italic option, however.. These may include: Rainbow Speak, fading the text slightly, changing the font size or using a different font entirely. This is always limited by the print options in a given medium, of course. Comics and manga love these options, for some reason.\nBold occasionally happens, but it's incredibly rare. As are the practically endangered Small Caps and underline. Clunky-shouty. Italicsnote\u00a0and practically anything else, probably, just look more \"thinky\" than they do.\nThere is no hard-and-fast convention for punctuation \u2013 yet. <This is, perhaps, one of the closest to it, at the moment, though.> /But, at one point, you could have said that about this.../\nWho knows what it'll be next?\nAnother common tactic is this: if a work usually uses \u201cdouble-quotes\u201d for standard dialogue, the author might then switch \u2018to single\u2019 in thought-dialogue. Or vice versa. If the author wants to sneak telepathy on you for a fridge moment, this might well be what they're using to do it. Because of this handy, but low-impact nature, though, it can be very easily missed as a cue by speed readers.\n> Other ways can have more oomph. ,Crazy over commas?, ;How about semi-colons?; :Or good old colons?: ...How >about< \u00abother\u00bb *recognisable* [systems] \u2013like\u2013 {all} ~these~?...\nComic Books have their own little quirk when it comes to punctuation: the breath mark (note, not the same as similar-named creations in musical notation or the various diacritical marks used in Ancient Greek Poetry as hints). This breath mark is a triple-lined bit of punctuation, rather than some take on a comma, apostrophe or letter, something like \u269ethis\u269f.note\u00a0Sadly, although these're included in the Unicode fontset, the fonts on your computer probably don't show them well. For this example, say thank you to Blambot. More commonly used for sighs, coughs and whispers, breath marks can and do lend themselves to the occasional thought, whatever balloon they find themselves in.\nIn short, any punctuation mark you've ever seen (and some you haven't) can be used as replacement quotation marks at the beginning and/or end of a thinky sentence or paragraph. Some just lend themselves better to it than others.\nMixing both italics and non-standard punctuation very definitely happens. As long as the author is consistent in where and when they use what, it's hardly a problem. It's all a matter of style, taste and the subtext.\nYou have to admit, however space-hungry these may be, they certainly mirror how thoughts aren't exactly pinned to the ground. These can give a distinctive look that can actually reach artwork levels at times, but which mostly hints at inserts from articles or another medium. However, if slightly overblown, these can become very difficult to read, particularly when colouring the background. It all depends on the author.\nOccasionally, some form of pop-up, hover text, widget or link is thrown in as an extra to the \"normal\" sentence, showing a character's true inner thoughts on a subject. Something no other medium can do. Footnote Fever truly shines in hypertextnote\u00a0You might have spotted that....\nThis trope is closed to examples for the simple reason that organising them all into overlapping sets would be highly problematic, but the page is open to discussion when you find a distinctive method that merits inclusion. Should you feel a work needs a special mention of Think in Text's use, please use that work's page of tropes instead.\n"}
{"OrwellianRetCon": "A sort of Retcon achieved not by putting out sequels that change the official story, but by actually going back and changing it in the original work, so that subsequent printings of \"the same\" work are actually different.\nMay happen as the result of deciding after that fact that something was Unfortunate Implications, Dude, Not Funny!, or Too Soon. But could also be caused by Flip-Flop of God, Science Marches On, or being Screwed by the Lawyers. So like many tropes, this can be for good or for evil.\nPrime source of Adaptation Displacement for more recent fans.

See also Creator Backlash, especially if the original version is taken off the shelves.\nNamed, of course, after George Orwell, specifically Nineteen Eighty-Four, where the main character's job at the Ministry of Truth is to rewrite old newspaper articles to hide the government's flip-flopping on political issues.\nOften happens in a George Lucas Altered Version.\nContrast Death of the Author, Canon Discontinuity.

{"Antidisestablishmentarianism": "\"Antidisestablishmentarianism\", as a word, technically refers to a specific political movement which would have opposed removing the Church of England from its status as the \"official\" church of Ireland. (The Other Wiki has some information, if you're curious.) A more modern definition is that it refers to the movement to dissolve the legal separation between church and state.note\u00a0or sometimes as opposing the removal of the C of E from its status as the official church of England itself. That's what the Burma Shave quote was referring to. This is not about that movement, however. This is about the word.\n\"Anti-\", meaning against, \"dis-\", meaning to negate, \"establishment\", a structure, \"-arianism\", a sect or schism surrounding said establishment. Taken together, it means \"A position counter to dismantling the establishment\". Since that's a double-negative, it can be generalized even further to simply \"pro-establishment\".\nYou see, this infamously long-winded word is more famous for being long, unwieldy, and taking a heck of a long time to type. If anybody needs a go-to big word, this is the one they usually pull out. (Especially if it's at a Spelling Bee.) It's not even the longest word in the English language, though it is the longest one that is neither a scientific term nor specifically coined to make a huge word. Why this word? While it's long, it's really just \"establish\" with a bunch of fairly standard prefixes and suffixes tacked on. It's not even hard to spell, since it's spelled exactly as it's pronounced, without any of English's 1001 special spelling exceptions or oddities.note\u00a0(You might note it still contains two different ways to pronounce the letter \"a\"; three to pronounce \"s\", in one of which it is combined with another letter; depending on whether one is speaking British or American, two to three ways to pronounce \"i\", the third of which is as a diphthong; and two different ways to pronounce \"e\"; all within the same word. And a couple of the vowel sounds are written with a different letter in different places. But by the standards of English, that's \"spelled exactly as it's pronounced\", seriously.) Possibly because it's Inherently Funny. A favorite form of Sesquipedalian Loquaciousness.\n"}
{"MiniMap": "An in-game display of a miniature version of the entire level. The game has to be one where your normal field of view is limited to the area around a player character. Therefore, Real-Time Strategy games and such doesn't count.\nExamples generally fit into one of two types:\nSystems that display a map of where the player has already traveled are often said to be utilizing \"automap\". The term descending from early role-playing games where the player was often expected to create their own map, typically on graph paper.\nThe map display would also rotate to indicate the direction the player is facing, either by rotating the 'you are here' cursor arrow, or by rotating the entire map so that up is the direction they are going. Generally the former method is more commonly used in older games as it was much easier with limited processing power to rotate an arrow than it is to rotate the entire map.\nMay also be a Enemy-Detecting Radar, if it shows enemies.\n"}
{"HorseOfADifferentColour": "Evolution being what it is, alien worlds (or Earth time periods far removed from the present day) are bound to have different forms of animal life from our world. The people there, however, are usually just like us, or close, and would therefore develop different breeds of livestock to fill the same needs.\nAnd one of those major needs is for animals that fill the niches that horses fill on Earth: basic transportation in areas where mechanical transport is impractical, unknown, or expensive; or prestige transportation in areas where mechanical transport is cheap and easy. Horse-replacements may also be used as draft animals.\nOf the types of creatures available, large flightless birds are probably the single most common type of horse-replacement. Two-legged fast dinosaurs come up frequently. To replace the larger draft animals, vaguely ox-like creatures and large lizards seem to be popular, and some may be Mix-and-Match Critters.\nEvil, bloodthirsty races will often use a giant form of a common predator, like a wolf. Cats are a mixed bag; they are predatory, and notoriously disobedient, but both heroes and villains can be seen riding them, and performing great feats of sure-footed trick riding.\nA flying creature that can be trained, and can carry a man, is truly the holy grail of animal husbandry. Most fantasy settings have at least one, either a scaled-up version of a currently existing creature or something from prehistory or mythology. Dragons are especially popular in this department as are Gryphons and Pegasi.\nFor maximum Speculative Fiction cred, try having the mount not even being made of flesh and blood. In video games, these often become a Powerup Mount.\nNamed for an idiom meaning \"another matter entirely\", and a pun on that phrase in The Wizard of Oz which was a literal horse with an ever-changing coat.\nCompare Call a Rabbit a \"Smeerp\", when the animal actually is, for all intents and purposes, identical to a real-world animal. Super Trope of Zebras Are Just Striped Horses, Kangaroo Pouch Ride and Seahorse Steed, and sometimes Domesticated Dinosaurs. For actual horses (or other animals) with unusual colors, see Amazing Technicolor Wildlife.\nNothing to do with the album of the same name by the country group Big and Rich.\n"}
{"UpTo11": "Exceeding the previous maximum, to an exaggerated degree.\nFor some people more is always better. Exactly what there is more of can vary. More volume, more power, more pretty, more money, more more. Whichever, this trope is about setting a whole new \"most\" for anything.\nFor those who aren't into electric guitar, \"Taking it up to eleven\" is a reference to the maximum volume setting on a guitar amplifier. In a nice example of Defictionalization, Marshall came out with an amp that went up to 11, mostly in response to the trope being used in This Is Sp\u0131n\u0308al Tap. Later, many Marshall amplifiers began to sport 0-20 volume knobs, essentially taking the trope itself Up To Eleven.\nConspicuous Consumption and Absurdly High-Stakes Game often involves this.\nNot to be confused with Loud of War, The Same, but More.\n"}
{"PowerOverhaul": "Most of the time in media, people gradually adapt to their new abilities, whether these are supernatural or not. It's not uncommon to get drama and chuckles out of a hero figuring out \"How Do I Shot Web?\". However; occasionally you have a sudden change in powers accompanied by someone becoming insanely competent in their use.\nMuch like Possession Implies Mastery, a character becomes an expert in their new power or school of magic as soon as he gets it. Almost as if it were a computer program he just installed. A character previously seen only ever swinging a sword around suddenly dons a robe, loses the sword, and starts throwing around the battle magic, while a character who never got in a fight before and has some prophetic powers suddenly becomes some sort of martial god. Villains generally tend to be much more competent with new powers than heroes.\nThis has the potential to be done poorly and become infuriating; however, it can be done well, assuming that there is actually a reason for something like this to happen.\n"}
{"VoluntaryVassal": "The standard mode of territorial expansion of The Empire is steamrolling all opposition in the targeted neighbor land and claiming it as its new vassal state-slash-province. However, some places and people prove too troublesome to conquer and the empire leaves them alone. And then some of them decide to swear allegiance to The Emperor, anyway, for the benefits that a large centralized state brings with it \u2014 minus all the inconveniences of being forcefully subjugated by a foreign invader.\nCharacters coming from such a region commonly enjoy privileges and personal freedoms that the rest of The Empire's citizens (except the metropolitans) no longer have.\nCompare/contrast Hegemonic Empire, where The Empire doesn't expand through conquest, but instead incites other states to voluntarily become its vassals by peaceful means (in effect, making this trope a norm instead of exception). Compare also Puppet State, Les Collaborateurs, and The Quisling. Vichy Earth may or may not be an example as well.\n"}
{"BilingualConversation": "For whatever reason, two or more characters can't speak the others' language in anything better than heavily mangled, imprecise gobbledygook. However, all involved can understand the others' language when spoken. This results in unnervingly cool, creepy, or cantankerous scenes depending on the set-up, as you have two people listening and responding to each other in completely different languages, creating a Bilingual Dialogue (and sometimes acting as interpreters to any third parties present.)\nWhat you end up with is a conversation that goes something like this:\nAnnette: \"La plume de ma tante est sur le bureau de mon oncle.\"note\u00a0My aunt's pen is on my uncle's desk.\nBenny: \"Oh, I'll go get it, then. Do you want anything else while I'm up?\"\nAnnette: \"Non, merci, c'est tout.\"note\u00a0No thanks, that's all.\nThis can be Truth in Television. If you learned a foreign language by speaking it (as is common in many schools which use a listen-and-repeat teaching format), rather than by learning to read it, it is easier to passively understand what someone else is saying than to actively generate language oneself. If each person understands the other's first language, it's easier to use this type of conversation than for one person to struggle to speak in a more uncomfortable second language. However, the same result can also happen when the opposite approach is taken (with each person speaking the language they're less comfortable in, because it's easier for a fluent/native speaker to understand a limited, pidgin version of the language than it is for someone with minimal knowledge of the language to understand complex sentences with uncommon words).\nSee also Bilingual Bonus and Eloquent in My Native Tongue. Compare Intelligible Unintelligible. A common theme with Translator Buddy characters.\nContrast with Language Barrier.\n"}
{"SpinOffBabies": "Cartoons have a tendency to get spun off into new shows with younger versions of the original characters. No one is quite sure why producers do this, aside from the opportunity to make a new franchise for a new demographic out of an older, successful property. Often the concept of the original show is dropped entirely and replaced, but sometimes it's adapted to an elementary- or middle-school setting. Frequently parodied, due to the absurdity of some of the examples.\nNote that those are usually not prequels, and not part of the original show's continuity. It's usual for people who supposedly met for the first time in the original show to meet in the \"younger\" show, or for characters with notably different ages in the original show to be babies/middle-schoolers at the same time. If they are descendants, then it's Spin-Offspring.\nIf any of the voice cast of the original series is still alive, expect them to have occasional-to-recurring guest roles as the parents of the younger versions of their original roles (e.g. Henry Corden, the regular voice of adult Fred Flintstone at the time, was the voice of young Freddie's dadnote\u00a0and mom on The Flintstone Kids).\nBy the Turn of the Millennium, it basically became a Dead Horse Trope. Nowadays, few if any of these shows are being made.\nRelated to Recycled In Space and High School A.U..\nContrast Time Skip, which tends to make the characters older instead.

{"MirrorSelf": "When you look into a mirror, you see a person who is in some ways identical to yourself, but who is also in some ways your opposite. If you are right-handed, your mirror will show a left-handed person, and vice versa.\nThis \"same but opposite\" is the cornerstone of a Mirror Universe. A character's \"same but opposite\" counterpart is the Mirror Self. However, a Mirror Self can sometimes also be created by misuse of Applied Phlebotinum.\nNot to be confused with an Alternate Self, who is the same person without being an opposite. Might have gone through different experiences and been changed by them, but is not a polar opposite like the Mirror Self. Compare Me's a Crowd.\n"}
{"ScrewThisIndexIHaveTropes": "Any trope about actively deciding \"screw this\" for whatever reason. Most likely, because you have something that can be used to get past the \"this\" in question.

Something Awful has dubbed two specific variations of video game cruelty as Asshole Physics and Asshole AI.\nSome games specifically cater to this; these often skip out on a Karma Meter. This can also be the carrot along the path to The Dark Side for players in a game with a Karma Meter.\nThe severity of this trope varies. Some games only let you be cruel to your enemies and give harmless Non Player Characters immunity. (Harmless enemies will still be fair game.) Other games let you torment random NPCs you meet along the way. Still other games give you absolute, unchecked control over your subjects.\nIn games where there is a level editor or allows a sense of creativity, the trope can be taken up to eleven by allowing those with less constructive intentions to target those of a player character nature just for fun. This can also happen outside of creative games/sandboxes through the medium of joke weapons or modifications/hacking.\nThis trope is often used for laughs. Remember, though: Just because a game lets you do something doesn't necessarily mean you should do it.\nContrast Video Game Caring Potential \u2014 though sometimes helping your little drones means doing horrible things to their enemies... See also What the Hell, Player? and Video Game Perversity Potential. If the game or genre usually does not permit cruelty even though there's no particular in-game reason for that, but this time they do, you have Reality Ensues.\nOne of the Acceptable Breaks from Reality. You may laugh at video games, but if someone did this in Real Life? You probably wouldn't be laughing. And if you are, then you're a sick freak.\nThis trope has a few Sub Tropes. Please make sure that your example does not fit better in one of these.\nFor examples where someone takes joy in being a dick to other players, see Griefer.\nNote that, since such actions are not mandatory in the story, these actions cannot be considered a Moral Event Horizon or qualify a player character for Complete Monster status.\nPlease only list aversions and non-Video Game-related examples here.

{"FishMen": "Fish People are a specific category of (usually) intelligent, underwater fantasy species. While they're humanoids (one head, two arms, two legs), they don't look human at all; their bodies, especially the faces, have a fish-like/reptilian appearance. This means that mermaids are not true Fish People, at least not the kind described here. Neither are more human-like sea dwellers such as Aquaman or Namor the Sub-Mariner. A Fish Person's Character Alignment and ability to survive on land vary depending on the character and the work.\nWhile Fish People are most often a pre-existing race, sometimes they are former humans (or fish) who are the result of mutation. This origin seems especially prevalent in Western Animation.\nMerfolk can have a similar style, but they usually fail the critical \"has legs\" check \u2014 although the key word here is usually, since Our Mermaids Are Different. Since many Fish People appear somewhat reptilian, Lizard Folk and Reptiles Are Abhorrent are also related tropes. Expect them to create breathtaking Underwater Cities. The more civilized variants may have Clothing Appendages formed from fins if they don't have actual clothes.\nFish People are a subspecies of Petting Zoo People. Super Trope to Shark Man. Cousins to Frog Men.\n"}
{"UpperclassTwit": "The Ditz with a trust fund. The Upper-Class Twit is either an aristocrat or a relative of someone in the upper echelons of society, and is automatically provided with all of his living expenses. In other words, he was a Spoiled Brat as a child, and now he has no reason to contribute to society, which is just as well, since he doesn't have the skills to contribute anyway. More often than not, he leads a hedonistic lifestyle that embarrasses his family. Highly prone to Conspicuous Consumption. Embarrassing the family enough or doing something truly heinous as opposed to just assholish may get them cut off, but this is not exactly common.\nUsually used as a foil for The Jeeves or some other more intelligent but lower-class character. The male Upper-Class Twit is often a prime target for Gold Diggers.\nA popular subtype, and the female counterpart to the usually male Upper-Class Twit, is the Airhead Heiress \u2014 a young, brainless, fashion slave party girl heiress. Any resemblance to Paris Hilton or one of the Kardashians is purely coincidental.\nSometimes they're Obfuscating Stupidity, and they may even be up to something far more interesting after hours. See also Sheltered Aristocrat.\nOn the off chance that the Upper-Class Twit has a job, it will be a sinecure with no apparent duties. A Twit in a position authority may become a Pointy-Haired Boss, but that is less common than one might expect: a Pointy-Haired Boss has responsibilities which he bungles, while a true Twit has no responsibilities at all. To become a Modern Major General is a more respectable career path for a brainless young aristocrat. An older one, especially in 1920s-1950s settings that involve murders in libraries, may well be a retired Major or Colonel, being referred to by that rank.\nA Sub-Trope of Idle Rich.\nCompare Valley Girl (who doesn't have to be rich, among other differences), Rich in Dollars, Poor in Sense, Nouveau Riche (who starts out poor and strikes it rich, and is crass about it).\nThe opposite side of the same coin is the Gentleman Snarker, who is very clever but terminally lazy.\nContrast with Authority Equals Asskicking, Non-Idle Rich, Lower-Class Lout.\nThe Distaff Counterpart of Rich Bitch.\n"}
{"IProduct": "Remember how we'd attach the letters A and E to almost everything? Good times. They stood for \"atomic\" and \"electronic\" respectively, so it could damn well apply to any new gadget at the time. Ancient history now...We've moved a vowel over.\nThe letter \"i\" can prefix anything and make it sound cool. People often have the misconception that only Apple does this with its line of electronic products, but nope - they weren't the first ones to flex their \"i\"s, and they're not the latest. Companies everywhere are cashing in on the iFad. So why \"i\"? Well, it likely began with the iMac, where it stood for \"internet,\" because the iMac had a built-in modem and was designed mainly for web browsing note\u00a0 In Europe at least the fad for i began in the eighties where it was commonly used as a suffix. It started with cars, such as the Golf GTi, where it notionally stood for fuel injection but did spread to non-automative products as a supposed sign of being technologically advanced. It was parodied to death by comedians like Harry Enfield and eventually became discredited for a few years before it began being used as a common prefix.. It also stood for \"individual\", as opposed to the Power Macintosh line of professional machines. It was later codified by the iPod, the most popular portable media player. The \"individual\" meaning has since spread to items and software where the \"Internet\" definition makes no sense, so more recently people seem to figure it's used like the pronoun. As in: \"This phone is mine, bitch, back off!\" or \"Look at me! This is what I'm like!\". Ah, the power behind lowercase letters.\nSee also Super Title 64 Advance for videogames, and Xtreme Kool Letterz for other letters that make things cool. In Speculative Fiction, this can be a sign that Everything Is an iPod in the Future.\nSee also iPhony for direct parodies of Apple products.\n"}
{"FierySalamander": "In fiction, it's not uncommon to see reptiles being associated with fire. After all, Dragons are often portrayed as reptilian, and it's common knowledge that they breathe fire. Plus, dinosaurs have often been associated with volcanoes and lava. Being cold-blooded, reptiles are more comfortable with warm climates, especially lizards, who like to rest under the sun, which is pretty much symbolic to fire. And let's face it, the concept of a giant lizard breathing fire, swimming in lava and living in volcanoes is just plain awesome.\nThe trope is named after the salamander, a mythological animal depicted as a fire-breathing lizard or a wingless dragon. Nowadays, the name is given to a real animal who actually isn't a real reptile, but a small amphibian with a lizard-like shape. However, alchemists would often attribute them mystical properties, such as the ability to survive fire, or even extinguish it by the mere coldness or their blood. As a result, the legendary counterpart of the salamander stayed in the memory, and has been raised to the rank of Elemental Embodiment Fire, and also part of its subtrope, Alchemic Elementals.\nThe exact reason for all these stories and the length of times through which they survived is often theorized to be due to a behavior of Real Life Salamanders. Being amphibians, they seek to lair in humid locales, like stacks of wood kept outdoors. People would then use that wood to make fires, which would wake the Salamanders and cause them to flee for their lives, leaving people convinced the creatures had been \"birthed\" by the flames through abiogenesis. As wood remained a primary source of heating for humans till the industrial revolutions, such events, though rare, would keep reoccurring, ensuring that the myths of the fiery Salamander would live on.\nSince Reptiles Are Abhorrent, expect a frequent association to Demons, Hell-Fire and Fire and Brimstone Hell. Exceptions do exist, however: a dragon or dinosaur-themed protagonist can sometimes be associated with fire as a way to reinforce his hot-blooded temper and bravery rather than his evil nature. Those exceptions seem to be especially popular in japanese culture, where the connection of reptiles and dragons with evil isn't as strong as it is in Occident.\nNote: Fiery Salamander is not to be confused with real life Salamanders which are actually amphibians that live in and around water. Also, this trope applies to reptiles and reptile-like beings as a whole, not just Salamanders.\n"}
{"Flashforward": "This page is about the trope. For the 1996 series, go here. For the 2009 series, go here.\nOpposite of a Flashback and different from a Distant Finale and not quite Time Travel or a Dream Sequence. The Flash Forward is a look ahead at what may be a possibility in the characters' futures. When it occurs once at the very start of a work, it's How We Got Here.\nNot to be confused with Seers - characters who can view the future (or a possible future) inside the context of the story.

{"UniverseChronology": "An indispensable part of the World Building process for an epic fantasy world or Space Opera universe is a timeline showing when all the events described in the stories and back stories happen, and how many days, months and years pass between them.\nThey go nicely with a Fantasy World Map, and often make appearances in Universe Compendiums and Universe Concordances.\nSee also The Trope History of the Universe.

{"TheRocinante": "There is the Cool Horse... and then there's this, the four-legged equivalent of The Alleged Car, a broken-down nag destined for the knacker's yard or the glue factory \u2014 or it would be, if it hadn't somehow wound up in the hero's possession.\nAny member of the genus Equus can qualify.\nIf the animal's appearance turns out to be deceptive and it's unusually strong or fast, then it may be a stealth Cool Horse.\nCould perhaps make more sense being retained than the inanimate related tropes, given that the steed is alive, so disposing of it would be unheroic and they're more conducive to becoming attached to.\nMay overlap with Moody Mount. See Horsing Around for healthy horses with attitude problems. Compare with The Alleged Car, The Alleged Computer, and The Alleged House for other items of dubious quality.\n"}
{"GenericanEmpire": "This is the tendency for space states not to have an actual identification beyond a generic term for a given political system. Often this is specified a little by equally generic terms such as \"of planets\". But there is no identity with any local culture. Writers can justify this by explaining that past conquerors decided that it was bad politics to hurt their subjects' feelings more than necessary. This is partly a result of Good Republic, Evil Empire: The Republic or The Good Kingdom are generic goodness, empires are simply evil, and that's all that needs to be said.\n"}
{"AcidAttack": "\n\n\n\n\nWhile not one of the classical four elements, and not quite as common a \"secondary\" as electricity or ice, acid and the manipulation and control thereof is far from a rare inclusion in the roster of Elemental Powers and Stock Superpowers.\nAcid tends to be very closely tied to poison \u2014 indeed, some works may not even draw a distinction between the two at all. When acid and poison are present in the same setting or game system, rather than being one and the same, the difference between the two tends to be that poison is treated similarly to disease and other status conditions \u2014 i.e., it is more a form of constitution and lingering damage that keeps sapping health rather than a true attack \u2014 while acid attacks deal direct, one-off physical damage like other elemental attacks do.\nWhen not tied to poison, acid may instead be linked with water.\nPower over acid is rarely associated with pleasant or benevolent figures: even when used by a heroic character, acid tends to be associated with harsher, darker heroic archetypes than other elements are. It's very rare indeed to see the Ideal Hero wielding acid as a weapon. Control over acids tends to also be associated with reptiles, likely due to their own ties to poison and less than stellar reputations; after fire and ice, acid is possibly the most common Breath Weapon for dragons. Acid is also often associated with Blob Monsters, slimes and similar creatures.\nSpecific acid-based powers can take a number of forms. One common variation is for a character or creature to be able to create and release acid from their mouth, usually in the form of acidic Super Spit or a corrosive Breath Weapon. Another, more passive possibility is for the acid to be secreted from the skin, either constantly, at will or in response to certain stimuli, creating a caustic coating that damages anyone making direct contact with the acid's user. Acid can also be portrayed as dealing Armor Piercing damage, to represent it eating through enemy armor.\nNote that, in real life, corrosive substances come in two distinct kinds: acids (low pH) and bases (high pH). As the differences between the two may not always be obvious to someone without some chemistry training, fiction tends to fold bases into acids and treats any reactive, corrosive substances as a nonspecific acid.\nSee also Hollywood Acid, for unrealistic depictions of acidic substances in general.\n"}
{"PowerupFood": "Quite simply, this is a foodstuff Power Source that bestows some benefit when eaten. The powers may be temporary or permanent, the food might work only for one specific character, it may even be just a placebo, but the result is the same \u2014 ingesting it gives the eater positive results, often granting super powers or turning him into a badass.\nDiffers from Super Serum and various types of magical potions in that the Power-Up Food does not seem rare, unusual, or hard to produce. As a general rule of thumb, a Power Up Food should not look out of place if it appears at a grocery store. This power up is often the solution to whatever problem the character is having.\nA very popular Power-Up item in Video Games. Many times, the Power Up Food is also the Trademark Favorite Food for the character, for obvious reasons.\nWhen eating food only restores health (but does not grant any other new abilities), the trope is Hyperactive Metabolism.\nWhen this trope is used to sell Real Life food products, then the trope is Cereal-Induced Superpowers. Also see Bottled Heroic Resolve and Transformation Trinket. May invoke Addiction-Powered if abused.\n"}
{"YowiesAndBunyipsAndDropBearsOhMy": "Like most countries in the world, Australia has a number of cryptids and mythical beasties allegedly lurking out in the forests and outback (because actual Australian Wildlife just isn't interesting or dangerous enough). This page covers the most common creatures found in Australian folklore.\n"}
{"EndOfTheWorld": "This is what will happen if the heroes don't stop the Evil Plan from doing its nasty work. It can be either supernatural or superscience, depending on the villain, but in either case the bad guy must be beaten down and his toys broken in order to save the planet, or the universe, depending on the focus of the story.\nUsually it's figurative \u2014 expressed as \"merely\" the death of humankind, the obliteration of Civilization, or its subjugation to aliens, for example \u2014 rather than the literal rendering of the planet down to gravel.\nThis is a common trope in Speculative Fiction, horror and over-the-top espionage shows, as well as many anime series. It may serve as a prequel to an After the End series, or the culmination of a Just Before the End story. May also include Cosy Catastrophe and/or Scavenger World elements \u2014 if so, let's just hope the dog lives. It's also very common in video games, where it's occasionally unavoidable, sometimes occurring halfway through the game; in other cases, poor play may result in the world coming to a bad end. If it's a Cosmic Horror Story, expect an Eldritch Abomination to be on its way and, should it make it to Earth before the protagonists can get the necessary power to stop it from coming, nothing can stop its rampage as such stories rarely end in a victory for humanity.\nIf the heroes are slated to succeed in preventing the End, they (and the audience) may be treated to a detailed preview of what's coming. The most common subversion keys on the \"as we know it\" part of the phrase: the world may not actually end so much as be changed beyond of all recognition. Depending upon the world this may actually be an improvement.\nInevitably draws the suitably heroic into a Saving the World plot. See Apocalypse How for various types of End Of the World. For when Take Our Word for It simply won't do, Apocalypse Wow is this trope given dramatic form. When asked just why they want to destroy the world as we know it, villains usually say something from the \"Why You Should Destroy the Planet Earth\" list. That is, if they even have one. May be preceded by Signs of the End Times. If the plot starts after End of the World happened, see After the End. If the villain does destroy the planet, it may be a case of The Bad Guy Wins and a possible Downer Ending, although it could end as a Bitter Sweet Ending if all hope isn't lost.\nThe Omnicidal Maniac is defined by this trope; destruction of the world is their goal because that would destroy all life on it.\nIt is a common source of Enemy Mine if another villain wants to Take Over the World, because after the End of the World as We Know It, there's nothing left to take over. As it happens, don't be surprised by the appearance of the Despair Event Horizon.\n"}
{"TimeCapsule": "Human beings are obsessed with leaving a record of ourselves so that future generations have some idea of what we were like.\nEnter the Time Capsule, an object specifically designed to withstand the elements and hopefully be dug up and opened some number of years (usually pre-determined) after its burial. \"Specifically designed\" is the keyword here; anything from the past is obviously going to be of interest to an archeologist, but it only counts as a time capsule if the one burying it intended it to be as such.\nCompare Write Back to the Future, which is essentially this trope meets Stable Time Loop. See also Dead Man Writing, Video Wills.\n"}
{"DarkFuture": "This is a disambiguation page.\n"}
{"ForTheLulz": "This is the motivation of an amoral character seeking... well, amusement. It's not that they enjoy being good or evil\u2014they may not know or care about the difference\u2014but they do whatever they feel like without regard for others. They don't need a motivation or justification for doing anything beyond the amusement of the act itself. As a result they almost inevitably do things that are dickish, maybe even cruel, but generally not outright evil. This same character will lead you into a trap, fight you to the death... and then stop on the brink of killing you to laugh and say \"Are you all right?\" They won't kill the hero, because they find their attempts to save the day amusing, or are intrigued by the sheer selflessness of their thinking. They may help the hero, they may help the villain, they may do both at once or screw over both at once. They are rarely if ever a driving force behind a story, but they nonetheless play a significant role. And why do they do all this? Why do they switch sides so often? Why are they working below the Big Bad when they're just as powerful and intelligent as they are, if not more? Why did they make out with the hero of the same gender?\nBecause it was fun. They'd do just about anything for a lark, really.\nPlease note, this is different from For the Evulz. Whereas a character who commits evil acts For the Evulz does so because they like seeing other people suffering, if this character does evil things it is only because they shatter the boredom of everyday life\u2014the character's not out to hurt anyone per se, but they don't care (much) if they do.\nThey usually believe Victory Is Boring, and if they're a Punch-Clock Hero or a Punch-Clock Villain, they're in it primarily for the entertainment value. They're incredibly dangerous to trust, and even they know it, perhaps noting how foolish the hero is to trust them. In action movies they can be a really awesome fighter, but they won't attack either side unless there's some entertainment value to be had, or if their life is in danger.\nIf they stick with the good guys all the way through, when victory comes they may leave to have more wacky adventures, or maybe character development will have them taking things more seriously.\nJust how much they care about collateral damage and hurting innocent people (if at all) varies. One of the few ways to really make an It Amused Me character take things seriously is to put one of their playthings in danger.\nOften such a character will be the Wild Card, an Enigmatic Minion, or Chaotic Neutral. A common saying of The Trickster character, the Eccentric Millionaire, the Great Gazoo, and the Screwy Squirrel. But be wary of the character devolving into Chaotic Stupid.\nAs you may have noticed, the line dividing For the Evulz and It Amused Me is something of an academic distinction. It is often hard to tell from a single act whether a character enjoys evil actions solely for the amusement value of the acts (It Amused Me) or whether they also/mostly enjoy the thrill of acting evilly (For the Evulz). Generally, a character who truly does things For the Evulz will do things that aren't fun or interesting in the name of evil, which they seek at every opportunity \u2014 a character who does things because It Amused Them wouldn't bother because if it's not fun or interesting, why do it? Such characters are not necessarily without a sense of morality, as they have been known to minimize the collateral damage of their schemes, for example, or even to stop what they're doing if they think they're harming the 'wrong' person or people. Someone motivated by For the Evulz would never do this.\nOn the other end of the scale, when a villain repeatedly gives this justification for supporting the protagonists, it can overlap with I Was Just Passing Through.\nThe trope is usually all the motivation one needs if one is a Troll. See also The Gadfly, who does things that trolls do, but for reasons besides amusement.\nSubtropes include Teasing from Behind the Language Barrier, Delighting in Riddles, and Loves Secrecy.\n"}
{"HonoraryTrueCompanion": "This character is on good terms with most, if not all, of the True Companions of the series. They will fight alongside them, shed blood and tears, and join in the celebrations. With their close-knit relationship with the main cast, you would expect that it would be a no-brainer for them to join them in a heartbeat. Alas, their alliance is always only temporary and once the goal is completed they're off on their merry way; perhaps on their own adventures, not mentioned here.\nUnlike the Sixth Ranger, who will join the squad on a permanent basis when given a chance, the Honorary True Companion is always prevented from joining due to some force of nature. Either they are \"needed elsewhere,\" or they just politely refuse for personal reasons. Despite never officially becoming a member of the team, they will remain the group's closest ally, being the first to respond in the need of help, and the series will continue with the offer to join the team still on the table.\nCompare to the Sixth Ranger, 11th-Hour Ranger, and Guest-Star Party Member. Contrast with Sixth Ranger Traitor. Sometimes may also be Remember the New Guy?.\n"}
{"DittoFighter": "A staple of Fighting Games, though not by any means uncommon in other genres, this character copies the moveset of the other characters. Generally, the Ditto Fighter comes in three variants:\nIn most cases, the moves tend to be less effective since they're built for the original character model's size/height, unless the Ditto Fighter is also the boss of the game.\nNamed after the Pok\u00e9mon Ditto, who can transform into its opponents. See also the related Moveset Clone, where two characters have the same moveset. Similar to, but distinct from Power Copying, which involves being able to copy one power/skill that your opponent displays and accumulating them as you encounter more of them; whereas the Ditto Fighter copies the whole power or skill set for one round or match and discards it to fashion a whole new skillset upon facing a different opponent.\n"}
{"CriticalAnnoyance": "(For the proper experience, run the \"music\" from this video while reading this page.)\nRed Alert! Red Alert! Life Meter almost empty! Critical Existence Failure imminent! Heal Thyself and this warning will go away.\nIn games where the player character(s) have Hit Points or some other measure of health, it's not uncommon for the game to warn the player that their health is low. After all, if their life meter depletes, it's Game Over, and the resulting consequence can be anywhere from a minor headache to a Rage Quit inducing catastrophe. However, while making a warning sound like a beep can definitely be effective in alerting the player to their condition, playing said sound over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again is pretty much guaranteed to get on the player's nerves.\nThis warning is ubiquitous in games with hit points or a life meter. It can get so annoying that the player is less likely to play carefully when health runs low. On the other hand, when a game does avert it, and you end up dying because you didn't notice your health was low, you may start to miss it.\nSome games use a Heartbeat Soundtrack as this sound. Some will have a character making the sound In-Universe, doubling as an example of Annoying Video-Game Helper.\nIt is partly Truth in Television, except in Real Life, signs can usually be much, much worse.\nAdvertising\nLive-Action TV\nMicrosoft Windows\nReal Life\nNon-Video Games\n"}
{"TheDentistEpisode": "An episode format where a character has to visit the dentist. The most common reason for this is having a cavity or a broken tooth, although sometimes they are just on a checkup. This trope is especially common in children's media. Usually a child character will get a cavity but be terrified of dentists, however they will learn that dentists aren't as scary as they thought and will probably learn about proper dental care.\nCompare to The Tonsillitis Episode, which is very similar. Like its sister trope, this trope is less apparent than it used to be however it will still appear. Sometimes overlaps with Sick Episode. Can also overlap with DIY Dentistry if the patient attempted to pull the tooth out before going to the dentist.\n"}
{"WartimeCartoon": "The term wartime cartoon refers primarily to cartoons made or released in The Golden Age of Animation during World War II and having some specific reference to the war effort. Many wartimes are explicit propaganda, while others make humorous jabs at conditions on the home front such as the rationing of fuels, materials and consumer goods, and even meat.\nWhile some wartimes have remained popular as period pieces, many of these are now considered controversial due to the caricatural depictions of Germans and (especially) Japanese (see Those Wacky Nazis and Yellow Peril, respectively). Of course, with The Holocaust now common knowledge, it's interesting how the racial policies of the Nazis were relatively rarely dwelt upon in those cartoons. So imagine the shock of the general public when the Final Solution death camps were discovered and their realization that, no matter what awful things the Allied propaganda might have claimed about them up to then, Those Wacky Nazis were actually worse, with them committing acts of villainy that beggared the worst of nightmares.\nTypical trademarks of these cartoons that are usually spoofed: propaganda elements, racist caricatures, outdated references to the war effort (i.e., Shout Outs to save scrap iron, conserve gasoline, buy war bonds, or grow a Victory Garden). Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and/or Emperor Hirohito often make a cameo and are ridiculed.\nSubtrope of Propaganda Piece.\n"}
{"IHaveNoDaughter": "Sometimes, what parents want for their children differs from what the children want to do, especially if the parent has plans for the child to Follow in My Footsteps. Sometimes the child wants to be himself in a career the parent dislikes. And sometimes, the parent struggles with this, but eventually comes around and supports his child.\nAnd sometimes he doesn't. And if the child (usually a son) doesn't step into line quickly, the offending parent quickly disowns him, disavowing all knowledge that this \"son\" ever even existed.\nCue the sad violin music \u2014 it looks like the kid is going to have to learn to make his own way in this harsh, harsh world all alone.\nThis doesn't mean that reconciliation is impossible further on down the track. But it usually happens years later, when the kid's a success and often when the parent is on their deathbed, and it's a long, bitter road until that happens.\nRest assured, however, that the chances of this happening are far higher than one might expect. The initial sequence typically takes place in flashback \u2014 we only learn the story because the now successful disowned son is giving us a sob story about how much he wishes his father would approve, or at least acknowledge his existence. If we see the event unfold in real time, then usually it gets wrapped up much sooner.\nBear in mind that the parent doing the disowning might not be entirely a jerk; sometimes, the kid just crosses a line they shouldn't cross (especially if they've grown up wrong or done something that violates their parents' trust) and deserves being kicked out with all ties severed. Again, reconciliation isn't an impossibility, but since this kid's bitter and twisted anyway don't expect it happening any time soon. And rest assured that the parent is going to have to justify their actions to the audience explicitly anyway, since the act of disowning one's own flesh and blood for any reason is well, pretty harsh. A justification commonly seen in a Crime and Punishment Series is when the parents essentially disown the child due to a crippling drug habit that the child has plunged into; this is often accompanied with a justification about how \"there's only so long you can watch or enable them to destroy themselves before you have to sever all ties.\"\nThis trope has various roots \u2014 most obvious is the tendency of many writers to be of Jewish descent. Orthodox communities could be particularly unforgiving when it came to children (particularly males) who decided to try making their own way outside of the Jewish community.\nOf course, overuse of this term has caused the words themselves to be considered a Dead Horse Trope, if not the entire plot itself. As a result most modern examples tend to skew toward the side of comedy and frequently involve something absurdly trivial. When the question is not about comedy but the descendant actually is the culprit, this trope can constitute Know When to Fold 'Em.\nThe Up to Eleven variant of this trope is honor killing, where the parents not only disown the child, but murder him or her.\nSee also: Changeling Fantasy, Unperson, and Where Did We Go Wrong?. Not to be confused with That Thing Is Not My Child!. Contrast You're Not My Father, which is the opposite and is more often aimed at a Parental Substitute.\n"}
{"TheSeries": "The unplanned version of the Pilot Movie, mirror image of The Movie. From time to time, someone in Hollywood will see a popular movie, and get the bright idea to turn it into a weekly series.\nUnlike the Pilot Movie, no plan to do this existed at the time the original movie was made. As a result, Adaptation Decay runs rampant; in particular, it may be necessary to perform a substantial Retcon on the end of the film, as a self-contained film would generally tie up its concept in such a way that the premise of the series would be preempted. An alternative strategy would be to tell an altogether different story, set in The 'Verse of the movie. Of course, the more open-ended the film plot, the easier this is. Sometimes, the series will claim to be a prequel to the film, though this idea can run into trouble if the show goes on long enough that the two crash into each other. Especially common in recent years are series that borrow nothing more than the basic premise of the movie, and go from there.\nExpect a substantial downgrade in visual effects. Also, Suspiciously Similar Substitutes or The Other Darrin for most or even all of the cast, as the talent available for a big-budget Hollywood movie is a somewhat different pool from that for a weekly series.\nAnimated Adaptations are common here, especially for movies created for adults but with significant kid-demographic overlap. Mind you, while there are plenty of cartoons for adults, these... won't be.\nIf the movie has a sequel, it usually won't acknowledge the series; the reverse may or may not be true.\nAs unlikely an idea as it sounds, there are a surprisingly large number of highly successful examples, some of which have even exceeded the original film in popularity. Unfortunately, those tend to dwindle next to the far larger number of shows that make you wonder what the heck \"someone in Hollywood\" was thinking (similar to the effect of watching an Animated Adaptation).\nCompare or overlaps with Artifact Title.\n"}
{"OnceASeason": "A recurring story element is used as a form of tradition within a show each season. This doesn't necessarily mean it is a Recycled Script, as more often than not the only similarity is the subject. The story itself can go in many different directions. At other times it can just be a Day in the Limelight, focusing on a specific character who normally doesn't get that much attention in the regular episodes. A sister trope to Once an Episode.\nIt should be made very clear that this isn't about a specific Myth Arc that is scattered at different parts of the season. Usually this episode's schedule is very consistent, especially if it is set around Sweeps. In some cases fans may note that there might be a set-up for such a character to appear once a season, only for the consistency to jump around to multiple seasons between appearances.\nMuch of the time it ends up as a Something Completely Different episode.\nCompare Mandatory Line, A Day in the Limelight, Once an Episode, Milestone Celebration and any number of the holiday tropes such as Christmas Episode and Halloween Episode.\n"}
{"TranslateTheLoanwordsToo": "A subtrope of \"Blind Idiot\" Translation and a relative of Recursive Translation. This is when a work in one language uses a word from another language, but when the work is translated into the language which it borrowed that word from, the translators are thrown off and try to translate it (even though it's already in their language) instead of leaving it as is. There are a few possible outcomes;\nHowever, bear in mind that loanwords sometimes evolve into \"false friends,\" acquiring a different meaning in the new language. While 'confetti' is borrowed from Italian, we haven't taken very good care of it: it means \"sugared almonds\" in its mother tongue.note\u00a0The confusion arises from the fact that sugar-coated almonds were (and in certain regions still are) indeed thrown like confetti, especially at weddings; paper confetti became a cheaper replacement for that. In turn, the italian word for the paper type, \"coriandoli\", comes from similarly sugar-coated coriander seeds used in the same manner; thus, both words share the same origin as sweets thrown at celebrations and later replaced with cheaper paper bits. Conversely, a German might think that she doesn't need to tell an English speaker what 'handy' means... except that it's a noun meaning \"mobile phone\" in German.\nWhen someone demands something be translated from a language they speak anyway, it's Completely Unnecessary Translator; if they simply took something in the original language that would be too rude for native speakers, it's Tactful Translation; if the \"same\" language actually does need translating, it's Separated by a Common Language. \"El Ni\u00f1o\" Is Spanish for \"The Ni\u00f1o\" is the inverse; when a phrase from the first language is left untranslated because it's a loanword in the second.\n"}
{"HellHasNewManagement": "The typical fate of characters that enter Hell is a horrific one; tortured by demons for all eternity. That's not the case with this guy. He'd much rather be the demons' boss than their victim.\nThis trope is where a character is sent to wherever it is that evil people go when they die and decides to take over. Depending on the setting, it may be where everyone, good and bad, goes, but rest assured that this character will make himself king of them all. It takes an especially devious, powerful and/or determined character to accomplish this given the heavy odds stacked against him.\nAfter all, isn't the afterlife run by gods? These are beings of might and wisdom far above the souls that come in for torment. Did You Just Punch Out Cthulhu? often happens in these cases.\nAmbition Is Evil will likely come into play. It's \"better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven\" right? According to Milton, that's what Lucifer thought when he set up a kingdom down there. Likewise, that's likely motivating this particular character. It's possible that they believe they can do a better job of ruling Hell. Whether this means Eviler Than Thou or creating Ascended Demons, this trope overlaps with God Job. On the flipside, if they never intended to follow through on taking the Devil's job but are forced to anyway by metaphysical laws, they'll find out that Someone Has to Do It.\nYou Kill It, You Bought It and Klingon Promotion are related tropes; a character takes the position by killing the previous holder of the position. See also The Usurper and Kill the God. Compare To Hell with This Infernal Job, where the Devil voluntarily quits his job. May cause the character to be Barred from the Afterlife if he doesn't qualify for Heaven and the existing management of Hell is afraid to let him in.\nIt doesn't have to be the Judeo-Christian idea of the devil or hell to count. Any local equivalent will do. In other words, Crystal Dragon Devil.\n"}
{"MidBoss": "A Mini-Boss, Sub Boss or Mid Boss is a distinct, generally unique, stronger-than-average monster that you encounter usually halfway to two-thirds through the level/dungeon/etc. It is noteworthy because it's tougher than any ordinary enemy (and isn't encountered under normal conditions like a Giant Mook), yet it still isn't as strong as the actual boss that awaits you at the end. In story terms, the mini-boss is often The Dragon to the level boss.\nSome games would have worlds split up into levels, and the level bosses would be mid bosses with the world boss being the \"proper\" boss.\nRecurring antagonists, such as the Goldfish Poop Gang and the Quirky Miniboss Squad, are often mini-bosses.\nIn the days when Nintendo Hard was the norm, this was especially sadistic. But as games got easier, such enemies were often just a little harder than the regular Mooks, and in some cases would just be Breather Bosses. But it's not always the case. Some lucky ones might even be a Wake-Up Call Boss or That One Boss.\nFighting games like to use the \"New Challenger\" screen normally used for when a second player joins when a midboss arrives.\nIf there is one, the reward for defeating the mini-boss is usually a map of the level, the featured item or weapon of the dungeon (as in the case of The Legend of Zelda games), or a Plot Coupon, such as the Boss Key.\nMay return as a regular enemy later in the game. Of course, normal bosses may become sub-bosses later as well.\nIn RPGs and related game genres, mini-bosses are often significantly less evil than the regular bosses, and are usually not directly interested in whatever evil agenda the Big Bad and The Dragon have. They can be Hired Guns, Punch-Clock Villain, or maybe they are Just Following Orders. Since they are less evil than seriously bad guys and are more intelligent and sensible than the random mook, they can defect or even perform a Heel\u2013Face Turn at some point in the plot when they realize they are not on the right side.\nCompare Smash Mook (and some often are), Elite Mooks and Disc-One Final Boss. Mini-Dungeon is a non-boss Sister Trope.\nCompare and contrast Boss in Mook Clothing, which is comparable in power to this, but is skipped just as easily as an average mook. Contrast Final Boss, naturally.\n"}
{"BlondesAreEvil": "A link somewhere on the internet sent you to this page.\nBlond Guys Are Evil and Blondes Are Evil have been disambiguated because of misuse. \"Villains who are blond\" isn't a trope, but People Sit on Chairs. We do have:\nPlease correct any wick to refer to the correct trope if they fit the definition.\n"}
{"TheNecromancer": "A practitioner of a specific kind of Whatevermancy, Necromancers are the masters of the art of death. Necromancy, the magic of interrogating the dead, has been practiced since at least Ancient Greece, where it was known as Necromantia, and probably earlier.\nIn typical media they're the epitome of the Evil Sorcerer, showing none of the respect Due to the Dead, using The Dark Arts to create an army of skeletons and zombies (or any kind of Undead being) to ravage the countryside or enslave souls of the damned for their own evil and twisted purposes. Any villain that practices necromancy is guaranteed to fall hard onto the far side of the evil scale, and any hero who dares to dabble in it can kiss his position on the good side goodbye.\nHowever, necromancy didn't always have the evil connotations that it has in media today. The word necromancy comes from the words nekros (dead) and manteia (prophecy), meaning that necromancers are more likely to summon spirits for divination than armies of rotting zombies. It was widely practiced across the world until the Renaissance when it was equated with demonology and got its bad reputation.\nThis means that sometimes necromancers are seen in a more sympathetic light, using their powers to commune with the dead, heal others, or use their power over souls for good ends. Most stories involving naive and inexperienced necromancers include the Aesop of how you should respect the cycle of life and death. In other cases, it involves the phrase \"Be Careful What You Wish For\" when those necromancers try to bring back a loved one. As it usually results in the resurrection going wrong and forcing them to kill their loved one.\nBut since that's not nearly as interesting as zombies, the idea of a necromancer unleashing waves of zombies still persists. Of course, that doesn't stop them from unleashing the hordes on the bad guys instead!\nCommonly overlaps with Necromantic; either someone attempts necromancy in order to bring back their loved one, or this was the start of their descent into evil. Sometimes a character will approach a necromancer for their help in bringing back their beloved.\nIt's not unheard of for a necromancer to be one of The Undead themselves, often a lich. Even if they aren't liches or other forms of undead themselves, they are likely to have unlocked other ways of prolonging their own lives to unnatural lengths. Furthermore, they may become partially undead.\nOnly metaphorically related to Thread Necromancer, where one resurrects dead forum threads.\nDo not confuse with necro-romancer (although one can lead to the other). See also Animate Dead, Tested on Humans and The Necrocracy. If the necromancer is juxtaposed with a healing or nature-controlling character, see Life/Death Juxtaposition. See also Fossil Revival.\n"}
{"FlamingHair": "Most characters have hair. But some (usually of a supernatural ilk) have hair that is either composed of flames, or simply takes the form of a fire on the individual's head. Usually an indicator of villainy. This may be the hair of characters who are literal Fiery Redheads.\nSee also Hot Wings. Often a part of Burning with Anger. If extended to the entire body it becomes Wreathed in Flames.\nDo not confuse with Elemental Hair, which is about hair color matching an elemental power, not an element being someone's hair.\n"}
{"InstantBandages": "Characters who suffer Amusing Injuries, or emerge from a Big Ball of Violence, will immediately sport bandages, even if they couldn't possibly have received medical attention. Sometimes, the bandages spontaneously appear in the very next shot, in the immediate aftermath of the blow, as if they had been stamped there by the force of whatever hit the character.\nThe standard example is a crossed pair of Band-Aids on the head, but the Instant Bandages may be more elaborate. Wrapped gauze dressings covering entire limbs, arm slings, and plaster casts complete with crutches from hammerspace are also fairly common.\n"}
{"DesperationAttack": "In Real Life, most physical fights get less dramatic as time goes on. What started out as two guys in their physical prime going at each other, if it goes on for ten minutes, becomes two guys bearing the accumulated injuries of ten minutes of fighting. Big hits become fewer and farther between, there's a lot more slow grappling, and it just starts to look sloppy. Similarly if one opponent at any point becomes significantly more injured than the other, that disadvantage tends to persist throughout the remainder of the fight.\nUnfortunately, this does not make for good storytelling, so when the heroes in most media start losing, that's generally because they're about to come back from behind and win the fight in the end. After all, it wouldn't be very interesting if they just stomped the baddies without even trying, and it wouldn't be very satisfying if they got stomped without being able to make some kind of comeback.\nThe problem with video games, though, is that the progress of the hero is directly tied to the skill of the player. And a player who's bad enough to start losing is probably bad enough to continue losing. While video games rarely simulate the negative effect that injuries have on fighting prowess, this still makes video game fights more similar to reality than the heroic mano-a-mano battles seen in movies.\nThe solution is to make characters more powerful when they're near death, to make the dramatic comeback a possibility. Hence the Desperation Attack, abilities or equipment that power up as the player character starts losing. Which, for most games, usually means when their health gets really low.\nOccasionally, this leads to a situation where the best strategy is to run around on the edge of death for the massive bonuses it gives you.\nNot to be confused with so-called \"desperation moves\" in Beat Em Ups, which are just special moves Cast from Hit Points, though these are sometimes replaced with Desperation Attacks when health runs low.\nRelated to the Limit Break, which is frequently accessed by taking damage but does not strictly require the user to have critical HP before use. Can also be a Sub-Trope of a Critical Status Buff (or its enemy counterpart, Turns Red; which in turn has a move-related subtrope, called Last Ditch Move) as well as Situational Damage Attack (if the attack gets more powerful the closer you are to death). Can also overlap with Last Stand. Compare Rubber Band A.I..\n"}
{"BattleOfTheSexes": "You know this trope. It's the one where people of different genders are treated as if they were more like different species, and species that can't communicate or get along at that. Since characters in works using this usually don't live in one-gender worlds, and tend to be overwhelmingly heterosexual, they are nevertheless compelled to seek interaction with each other. This usually works out about as well for all involved as you would expect.\nAlthough often \"officially\" a Discredited Trope, this is often also claimed as Truth in Television, sometimes with an edge of brave speaking out against Political Correctness Gone Mad, or with a Debate and Switch or \"Just Joking\" Justification approach.\nSubtropes include Men Buy from Mars, Women Buy from Venus, along with just about every \"war of the sexes\" trope in fiction.\nKey signs that this trope is in effect in a work: you appear to have come into a world where\nCharacters need not be (entirely) flat, but women will tend to be stereotypically female and men stereotypically male. Deviations from stereotype, where they appear, will tend to be plot points in their own right as exceptions that prove the rule, and are usually resolved by a return to something more stereotypical (e.g., Tomboy Wrench Wench gets her man when she finally cleans up nicely).\nWhich particular gender stereotypes are invoked may vary considerably, and inconsistently, even within the same work; e.g., women want romance/men want sex, women want to talk about feelings and go to the opera/Men Are Uncultured, All Women Love Shoes/all men hate shopping, Women Are Wiser/men are all Man Children, etc. Stock contrasting stereotypes (hello, Betty and Veronica) substituting for nuance will often also be in play. Outright logical contradiction between different stereotypes will rarely, if ever, be addressed.\nInsofar as this trope tends to rely heavily on binary gender stereotypes, it also functions (in a somewhat complicated way) as a Super Trope of several other Gender and Sexuality Tropes: expect regular joint appearances by complementary tropes such as All Men Are Perverts and All Women Are Prudes.\nThe key point, whichever particular stereotypes are invoked, and even where they are/seem to be avoided, is that male and female characters align so as to allow the first three points to apply. Whether men or women (or neither) come off better for the comparison may vary. Expect Double Standards to apply fairly frequently if the work does take a side for one or the other gender.\nWorks using this trope often also tend to outright celebrate the stereotypes they invoke (embrace your inner Manchild/Imelda Marcos!), and see them as making an essential contribution to the value of opposite-sex relationships, which just wouldn't be as meaningful without this particular source of misunderstandings and tension. Conversely, though, even where this trope is combined with outright misogyny or misandry, obtaining (at least) one of the opposite sex as a partner is still usually viewed as essential and urgent.\nIn works that use this trope as a central element, naturally, both male and female characters will also, as noted above, tend to be overwhelmingly or even exclusively heterosexual. Gay men, usually of the Camp Gay variety, may appear, often as a female character's Gay Best Friend.note\u00a0On a side note, binary contrasts similar to the Mars/Venus one tend to feature heavily in Boys' Love works and Slash Fic, with Seme and Uke couples, which often come complete with the same problems of communication and getting along as this trope attributes to heterosexual coupling. This just might be due to Most Fanfic Writers Are Girls. Lesbians tend to appear even less frequently, except as fantasy objects for male characters (and viewers): Bait-and-Switch Lesbians may appear for similar reasons, but rarely get beyond a Sweeps Week Lesbian Kiss.\nCharacters male and (especially) female who are affected by this trope may occasionally get wistful about the idea of how much easier things would supposedly be if they could only get together with someone of their own sex, but this rarely goes anywhere lasting, and the work will rarely notice how many potential Unfortunate Implications and internal contradictions there are in this line of thought. Transgender characters are also rare, but not entirely excluded, though expect treatment of any Gender Blending Tropes to reinforce rather than bring into question more traditional/mainstream gender binaries.\nAlmost unavoidable by definition in Chick Lit and Lad Lit, and the corresponding flick genres, and pervasive if not quite inevitable in Rom Com. Also a frequent feature of Dom Com.\nThe presence of certain actors (Jennifer Aniston, Meg Ryan, Sarah Jessica Parker, and on the Spear Counterpart side, Michael Douglas, Vince Vaughn, and Seth Rogen) tends to indicate this trope will come into play.\nA common feature of observational Recorded and Stand-Up Comedy. Oh, and there's just a tiny bit of this in advertising, too, as seen in Men Buy from Mars, Women Buy from Venus. This trope is also most of the raison d'etre of magazines specifically meant for one or the other gender (Cosmopolitan, FHM, etc.).\nDo not expect works that invoke this trope heavily on a regular basis to be shining examples of gender equality.\nThat said, in a perverse way works of this type emphasizing the male perspective tend to do better than average on The Bechdel Test, as in order to set up this trope they will normally introduce multiple female characters alongside the male ones, and by law of averages a few of the female characters' discussions will not be directly related to the opposite sex.\nLikewise, in works emphasizing the female perspective, there will also usually be at least one straight man who believes that Real Men Wear Pink. Although this will usually be countered by the character \"making up for\" this with an excess of machismo in other areasnote\u00a0for instance by also being a Cultured Badass who can readily \"prove his manhood\" in a brawl, or a Pornomancer whose actual character depth doubles as a way to seduce women, he will often serve as an example of how even a character Rated M for Manly does not have to mean a character who is unrefined or childish.\nThe Heteronormative Crusader probably believes in this trope, the Straw Feminist will see every difference or conflict between characters of differing gender as this trope, and the Straw Misogynist will decry any attempt to defy it.\nFor contrasts along cultural lines rather than gender lines, see Culture Clash.\nSome comedians that rely heavily on this trope:\n"}
{"BalkaniseMe": "In Alternate History and Speculative Fiction (especially the kind that takes place 20 Minutes into the Future), authors like to have fun by turning big countries into lots of smaller ones. May be justified by a war, a large-scale catastrophe, or simply a successful secessionist movement. Often happens with the United States of America, resulting in the Divided States of America, but other large countries such as China or Russia are also considered fair game.\nContrast Space-Filling Empire, which is about filling the map with large countries so as not to bother with pesky borders. Also see United Europe, Expanded States of America, and Middle Eastern Coalition as other examples of counterparts, where different countries link up or expand into huge regional or continental polities.\nHistorical Truth in Television.\n"}
{"UnEqualRites": "It's not uncommon to see a lot of rivalry between magicians in a fantasy setting, be it due to academic pride, competitive spirits, or plain jealousy. This is especially common if the setting has Mutually Exclusive Magic\u2026 and even if it all comes from the same source.\nMuch like the rivalry involved in Magic Versus Science, magic users will be prejudiced against each other based on their philosophy regarding magic, how they study it, and/or how they cast spells. You'll frequently see mages versus wizards versus witches versus clerics versus shamans deep breath versus druids versus warlocks. Put another way, a wizard of Ritual Magic will sneer at a bard who approaches magic as music, casting spells based on poetic rules. And of course both will scoff at the cleric whose magic is based on articles of faith rather than academic or artistic viewpoints. And then you have things like Psychic Powers and Ki Manipulation, which carry the additional question of whether they're magic at all or something else entirely.\nFrequently the themes behind the various forms of magic will take one of the various points within Functional Magic. Magicians who follow Magic A Is Magic A will be academic, studious, and always \"researching\" new spells. Artistic mages usually have some form of Functional Magic that they tap into in unconventional ways. Hermetic Magic practitioners follow ritual like academic magicians but usually ignore the \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d in favor of theological explanations or even plain old faith. Expect these mages to be on differing sides of Harmony Versus Discipline, with some seeking to \u201ccontrol\u201d magic, others to \u201cchannel\u201d it, and some to understand and influence it.\nObjectively, expect all these magical approaches to be valid in their own right, usually have Competitive Balance, (ex. ritual magic is usually stronger than any other magic, but takes longer, and requires spell components, while academic wizards usually need only to speak \u2014 or even think \u2014 to use a spell, but requires great training, study, and discipline) while at times being capable of a Yin-Yang Bomb when various disciplines collaborate. One frequent representation of this is the Trash Talk seen when people with opposite Elemental Powers fight each other. Only very rarely will these settings reveal there are Red Mages who combine these varying forms of magic.\nThis trope is named for the Discworld book Equal Rites.\nMages that ignore differences and mix-n-match supposedly-incompatible varieties of magic are described under The Red Mage. Compare Magic Versus Science and Hard on Soft Science, since usually one approach will be more scientific than the other. Of course, if you throw in science as well, expect all degrees of deadly projectiles to start flying.\nMagic or Psychic? covers the conflict between Functional Magic and Psychic Powers, specifically.\nFor a trope that covers a (usually) different kind of prejudice among fantasy characters, see Fantastic Racism. Compare Klingon Scientists Get No Respect.\nSee also Our Mages Are Different for the \"participants\" of this conflict.\n"}
{"HellFire": "Want to burn asbestos but haven't got the time? Need to Kill It with Fire but regular fire isn't enough? Fear not! For here at Trope Co., we have the ultimate form of fire, direct from the Fire and Brimstone Hell! And it's available in all standard designer colors! (Blue, green, deep red, and black are our hottest sellers!) Hellfire is usually presented as a upgrade to normal fire. How it's created/conjured varies from work to work. In some stories it's summoned from the bowels of hell itself or created by a creature that was born/spawned in hell. In other works it may be normal fire that's had black magic or the dark powers of a nether-realm alloyed to it. The point is, hellfire is not physical in origin, and doesn't have to play by the same rules as normal fire. Ignition without a source of oxygen? Sure! Scorching things that are supposed to be fireproof or made of fire? You bet! Since hellfire is often explicitly magical in nature it may also have other affects or the way it does what it does is different from conventional fire. While normal fire might melt something with heat hellfire may just disintegrate it entirely. Maybe whatever normal fire affected will be hot after but eventually the heat will die down but with hellfire, the object may stay hot or even feel cold. More than that when used on a living creature, hellfire might not hurt it the same way as normal fire. Instead of burning the body, hellfire may burn the soul and physical injuries are the result of a wounded spirit that may never heal. This is especially dangerous for characters with a healing factor or are immune to fire because if they are caught off guard and take a serious hit, they could die as Hellfire can bypass immunity to natural fire or negate a healing factor (at the very least the hellfire induced injuries might not heal).\nNotable when it comes from a story without any references to Christianity.\nNot to be confused with the Hellfire laser-guided missile, or the expansion to the original Diablo, or the Toaplan shmup, or the Villain Song from The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\nContrast Holy Hand Grenade and Faux Flame. See also Greek Fire, a non-magical example known for properties commonly attributed to this trope, in particular being able to burn underwater. Not related to Blazing Inferno Hellfire Sauce.\n"}
{"MoeAnthropomorphism": "Moefication of either characters who are not normally moe, or objects and concepts which are not even alive. Very popular with Fan-Art and merchandise. Often referred to as \"gijinka\", the Japanese word for \"anthropomorphism\".\nThe mecha musume \u2014 basically, battle vehicles or Humongous Mecha rendered as cute girls \u2014 are a common form of moe anthropomorphism. Can also overlap with Cute Monster Girl if the moefied character is a monster.

Supertrope to Cast of Personifications.\nSee also Humanity Ensues (technically unrelated, but can be compared as an in-universe variant thanks largely to the utilization of Morphic Resonance).\n"}
{"PullingHimselfTogether": "An enemy is beaten, blown to pieces, or else frozen/petrified then shattered. But wait! The pieces are combining! It's reassembling itself! Time to leg it!\nThis Subtrope of Nigh-Invulnerability may be greeted with shock, horror and cries of \"Why Won't You Die?!\" Not to be confused with From a Single Cell, where a monster/character regrows itself from a single part instead of reassembling itself from the already existing parts that were blown off. Can be seen as a specific form of Healing Factor, that manages to avoid the Shapeshifter Baggage otherwise involved.\nSee also Helping Hands, Losing Your Head, Who Needs Their Whole Body?, Appendage Assimilation and Good Thing You Can Heal.

{"KingOfGames": "The King of Games is not just a gamer, they are the gamer. In this world they live in, all games, be they video, tabletop, card, are their playthings. Alternatively, if there is just one game central to the medium in which you encounter them, they will specialize in it. Either way, they are masters of the game, stunning onlookers with their prowess and achieving feats of gameplay thought impossible. They have the highest score on the board, the best record time, the best built deck. In short, when it comes to their game(s) of choice, they are the best.\nIn any work where this trope is at play, expect Serious Business and The Rival to come up more likely than not.

{"SelfBackingVocalist": "Occasionally, when recording a song, there's no backing vocalist available to bring out the melody and harmony. The most common solution is for the artist in question to record his or her own backing vocals and then overdub them into the final recording. In some cases, this can be done several times over to create a \"chorus of one\" effect. The trope has been in use since the 1940s, when technology first allowed for the combination of several recorded tracks into one recording (also known as multitracking). Modern equipment makes this trope easier and can even apply the effect in real time. May overlap with Solo Duet.\n Liturature\n Video Game\nWeb Video\n"}
{"AlternatePersonalityPunishment": "A character does something worthy of punishment, but an alternate version, personality, clone or even past self (usually innocent or ignorant of the other's crimes) gets punished for it. Bewildering Punishment may ensue if the alternate self truly has no idea what they're being blamed for. Don't count on them on causing the Death of Personality for the guilty one, because that may not always be possible.\nRelated but distinct from Cartesian Karma, when some is held accountable for crimes they \"committed\" because they were mind controlled. Just as likely to be boil down to Moral Luck.\nCompare Revenge by Proxy and Amnesiacs Are Innocent.

{"Santabomination": "Santa Claus is an unusual man, ain't he? He's a spaceless, timeless immortal male senior citizen that seems to change his name and ethnicity depending on whatever country he exists in. He is omniscient (how else would he know if you've been bad or good?) and omnipresent (he can drop the right selection of gifts in every house on the planet with no one ever seeing him despite being a fat man apparently getting in through the chimney) and he can survive things that should kill a normal man his age (eating everybody's cookies and milk, living in the inhospitable wastes of the Northern hemisphere, nearly getting shot down by the U.S. military every year for being an unregistered airborne entity, etc).\nOften times this trope applies to Santa if it involves less the Christian side of Christmas (that is unless Yahweh is more the eldritch-horror type unsurprisingly) and more with the various Pagan traditions that applies to the holiday, various rituals of protection that have long since lost their original purpose over the years and have become modern Christmas traditions, meaning that the The Fundamentalists were right and Santa is a Pagan idol that could possibly destroy the Earth. Children don't give him milk and cookies as a \"please and thank you\" for the presents; they are offerings to appease his ever slumbering rage, waiting for the day when he reigns jolly doom upon the world.\nNow the kind of Eldritch Abomination would depend on the kind of traditions that would placate him. As a Humanoid Abomination, it is pretty much self-explanatory. The fact that he is able to survive whatever diabetic coma that keeps him away the other 364 days of the year speaks for itself. As an Animalistic Abomination, he does not have flying reindeer pull the sleigh, he is the flying reindeer, or at least some kind of Yule-Goat commonly confused for his more malicious counterpart. As a Botanical Abomination, Christmas trees can act as an effigy in its likeness, the various Christmas ornaments his many eyes or eggs or something.\nOften times this overlaps with Bad Santa and The Krampus.

{"TalentedButTrained": "When it comes to everyday life, there seem to be two ways to get ahead in life. In one corner, you have those that lack talent or innate ability but manage to achieve their desires and goals through sheer perseverance. In the other, you have the gifted prodigy who uses their boundless talents and skills to conquer any problem they face. Both type of people wow the masses at their amazing abilities, yet both send different types of messages. The first is that anything can be achieved through hard work and determination. The second is that some people are just born with it but aren't lazy about it. How realistic they are most likely depends on personal experiences.\nThen there is this kind of person. They have special attributes, be it art, math, or problem-solving, that most probably would give their eyeteeth to have. At the same time, they develop these abilities through research, practice, and failure like an average person. This person is the intermediary between the two extremes and is often viewed as the most grounded in reality. Most people in the world have at least one great quality about them, but for it to be of use to themselves or those around them, he or she must work on it, or else it becomes a total waste.\nThese kinds of people tend to showcase a certain Aesop \u2014 everyone has something in them that must be honed \u2014 but isn't necessarily required to be an example. This trope is more about the kind of individual a person is, not an ideal; therefore, it is very much possible for the Talented But Trained to lose out to other kinds of people, because nothing is assured and not everyone is perfect.\nWhile this trope can been seen as harping on just the talented, it examines the workers just as hard. There must be a point to all that practice and training. Wasted effort and time is just as, well, wasteful as sullied talent. Sure enough, if you wind up achieving the impossible, congratulations \u2014 \"working hard\" is your special talent, and you just saw the fruits of your labor.\nSadly, a person who is Talented But Trained can be easily mistaken, both by the audience and other characters, as just working really hard or being extremely talented. This often leads to them facing claims that their talent/power is their only strength, or inspiring unreasonable expectations in others.\nBoxing Lessons for Superman is one way for someone to become Talented But Trained. Those Weak, but Skilled also tend to be this, unlike their counterpart. The Perfectionist would love to be this at worst or The Ace at best.\nForms of a trifecta of effort/aptitude combinations with Brilliant, but Lazy (all talent, no effort) and High Hopes, Zero Talent (all effort, no talent). Contrast Underdogs Never Lose, in which the \"trained\" part trumps all else. Has a mix relationship with Hard Work Hardly Works, as one character will surpass those who don't train as much, but also those who do.\nCompare the Japanese Spirit (success goes to the person who has superior talent, training and morals), but success nor a strong moral compass is needed to be an example.\nCompare/contrast to Training the Gift of Magic. Sister Trope to Strong and Skilled, the difference being that trope is about a combination of abilities (power and technique) regardless of how they were obtained.\n"}
{"FantasyAxisOfEvil": "Any fan of fantasy, Heroic, High or Low (or otherwise) knows the usual Tolkien mould of heroic races \u2014 elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, and whatever else. (Oh, and humans too.) But of course the Always Chaotic Evil races often come in certain varieties themselves, in something of an Evil Counterpart trope of the Five Races.\nUnlike the usual Five Races they are not always allied, and are as prone to getting in fights with each other as they are with the 'heroic' groups. It's common for Evil Overlords to unite them yet other times they'll work together without a real leader. There will almost always be at least one good member of at least one race, and sometimes the story will make efforts to either show that they're not necessarily inherently evil, or find a way to justify it through magic, circumstances or whatever else.\n"}
{"DarkFic": "Deliberately writing a serious version of events related from a story which was originally quite lighthearted, \"serious\" in this case being more bleak, horrific, dark and/or possibly sadistic. Indeed, Dark Fic veritably wallows in (or savors) misery and darkness. This is sometimes satire, based on memes, or just writers flexing their creative muscles and showing us certain canonical elements that have the potential to be Nightmare Fuel. Or maybe the writer just enjoys depressing people with their writing style.\nWhen badly done (especially when the original work was a comedy), it will do nothing but squick readers, who will quickly abandon it. Or make people laugh. Well done, though, it can provide an intense and unsettling view of something supposedly familiar. Or it can make people laugh.\nThe Fan Fic version of Darker and Edgier. Related to Grimmification. Often the result of Fridge Horror, in which case it is the fandom equivalent of Ascended Fridge Horror.\nContrast with Fix Fic. A Dark Fic may or may not be the end result of a Deconstruction Fic. If the series was already dramatic and dark, it shouldn't really be here (e.g. it's impossible to make a dark fic of The Walking Dead unless you really take it to another level).\nComedies or series on the \"idealistic\" side of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism tend to inspire Dark Fic; similarly, \"realistic\" or darker stories inspire W.A.F.F. fanfic.\n"}
{"SwordOfDamocles": "A weapon used as a deterrent, to sway people into acting in a certain manner. This comes from the second moral of the original story of the Sword of Damocles, where \"The value of the sword is not that it falls, but rather, that it hangs.\"\nMore often than not, the weapon is intended to have some type of height advantage, to more explicitly invoke this image. This can include launchable weapons that once off the ground serve that purpose.\nThe Kill Sat may easily be an example of this. The Weapon for Intimidation is a somewhat related, smaller scale version. See also Appeal to Force and Gunboat Diplomacy. For the other moral of the Sword of Damocles story, see Prestige Peril.\n"}
{"UnbelievableSourcePlot": "This is a type of plot where the protagonist relies on a supernatural source of information to save lives or solve crimes. They may predict something bad and stop it before it can happen or they may use this ability to investigate crimes that have already happened in order to bring the perpetrator to justice.\nThis plot involves three essential elements:\nThe need for secrecy may require the protagonist to lie to the police and others about how they get their information and/or why they are always in the right place at the right time. The main character must keep the secret in order to avoid becoming The Cassandra, exploited, experimented on, etc. Unlike The Cassandra, the protagonist's closest contacts and allies may have learned to trust and rely on the information, but the need for secrecy outside their circle of trust remains. The protagonist's disregard for official procedure and frequent presence at crime scenes leave their allies walking a fine line to avoid getting fired for going out on a limb without being able to justify themselves.\nThis trope is sometimes frustrating to the audience, because it seems that everyone would be so much more effective at solving crimes/saving lives if the police just knew the truth. Keeping the police in the dark, however, serves the purposes of the drama \u2014 it creates a template of dialogue for each episode, where the protagonist has to (again) persuade the police contact to follow some lead, investigate a certain person, or be somewhere at a certain time. It's frustrating to the audience to see that scene reenacted every single time, but it highlights anew the incredibleness of the protagonist's gift and the incredulity with which an outsider might treat the idea. The audience might start to take the protagonist's gift for granted were it not for this repeated conversation with the police.\nSister trope of Vampire Detective Series, where the unbelievable source of information comes from the main character not being human and the degree of its unbelievability depends on the strength of The Masquerade.\nNot to be confused with Occult Detective, where the detective is normal and the crimes are supernatural.\nCompare/Contrast with You Have to Believe Me!, where the informed character chooses the craziest sounding ways to try to get someone to believe the truth and is always surprised when others refuse to listen.\nAll examples provided should specifically highlight how the example incorporates each of the three essential requirements listed above.\n"}
{"CharmPoint": "A charm point (Japanese: \u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30e0\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8) is a coveted and well-tended accessory of a character (often a flaw) that makes him attractive or at least interesting to other characters, if only in his own head. This can be anything: a well-groomed mustache, a bizarre body part, a favorite hat, a personality trait, or a bow tie. For maximum humor, the actual draw of the item may be completely non-intuitive to the audience, but make perfect sense to whatever minor passerby appears on the show.\nAt some point in the story the character may lose it (or someone else does) and rapidly become inept or clumsy at whatever he usually did with ease, while everyone would notice something is 'off' about him. Thus the item takes on a Magic Feather effect, even when he's reassured by the cast it shouldn't make any difference. Whether or not he learns an Aesop about it has no effect in his immediately retaking it once it's accessible again.\nMay overlap with Speech-Impeded Love Interest: if an otherwise perfect Love Interest has a stutter or a lisp, this may only add to his her/charm.\n"}
{"SocialDarwinism": "The Social Darwinist is someone who believes that the Darwinian theory of evolution \u2014 i.e. \"survival of the fittest\" to oversimplify it \u2014 should be applied to people, and sometimes entire societies or nations. To the Social Darwinist, all life is a struggle for survival in which the strongest naturally prosper at the expense of the weak \u2014 and it is right and natural that they should do so, because that's just the way things are, and/or natural law is Above Good and Evil. Such characters rarely concede that their chances for survival may have started higher than others due to reasons such as inherited wealth or social prestige. They typically state that We Have Become Complacent and stupid, and want to remove weakness and stupidity from society. It may seem to some that because humans aren't currently having wars/disaster and humans aren't endangered as a species that evolution in humans has ceased altogether.\nIf they do talk about evolution, they are very likely to talk about Evolutionary Levels and Goal-Oriented Evolution rather than Darwin's actual theory (which was more of a pass-fail concept).\nFictional Social Darwinists generally come in six major flavors:\nIn general, the fictional Social Darwinist is a Narcissist who mostly just tries to justify his own superiority over everyone else. If the Social Darwinist doesn't suffer a Karmic Death, the heroes \"disprove\" his might-makes-right philosophy by demonstrating The Power of Friendshipnote\u00a0if fact, actual evolutionary scientists posit that The Power of Friendship and general co-operation as the best survival strategy for most people most of the time, not to mention an evolutionary strategy that the human species specifically evolved to exploit: either by ganging up and beating the crap out of him and his cronies, or by the leader of the group (often the All-Loving Hero) doing it himself while repeatedly driving home that he's fighting for his friends. A particularly profound way this to happen is to have the character beaten by a character who is either a visible minority the Social Darwinist considers inferior or has glaring physical or mental handicaps.\nLess often, a sincere Social Darwinist will often begin to respect the heroes after their defeat; they may turn into a Worthy Opponent or even become a Noble Bigot as they struggle with their beliefs and begrudgingly admit that a group they had considered inferior does in fact have worthy people among them. Their beliefs might be a Tragic Flaw if they were drilled into them from a young age or they actually lived in some viciously hostile place where their views were justified.\nCompare Evilutionary Biologist, Evil Evolves, Kill the Poor, and Slobs vs. Snobs. Sometimes overlaps with Objectivism and the \"\u00dcbermensch\" concept. Hollywood Atheists are often stereotyped as this. The trope maker for The Beautiful Elite. There's a bit of this trope in the Satisfied Street Rat. Likewise, characters with a Darwinist Desire are usually only interested in applying social Darwinism on themselves and their offspring rather than imposing it on society, though both tropes can overlap in the same character. Compare and contrast Living Is More Than Surviving; Social Darwinists will variably put either survival or quality of life on top of others.\nNote that Charles Darwin himself would not be amused by all these people and the way they interpreted his works; he proposed nothing of the sort, and the idea predated him by centuries. (And while Darwin did believe that the Caucasian race had evolved further than other races, his racism was not based on arrogance or sociopathy; it was simply where his research led him. At the time, his insistence that all humans were the same species was controversial.note\u00a0Back then, basically everyone assumed from the outset that Caucasians were superior. Whether or not the other races were homo sapiens was an actual issue.) You never see a social Darwinist treating societies in the same way a real Darwinist treats species: Darwinists are interested in maintaining biodiversity (so the greatest number of traits are available to \"throw at the wall and see what sticks\" when a change in habitat occurs), and Darwinism is a description of the way species work, not a prescription for which species should live or die. See Appeal to Nature for the fallacy of using \"nature\" to prescribe any behavior (moral, immoral, or amoral), and also see the Analysis page for this trope for more information on that. This did not stop Social Darwinism from becoming a fairly mainstream philosophy from the Victorian era to WWII, when it became associated with the Nazis; this association contributed greatly to its loss of popularity. However, the emergence of culture war politics in the late 20th century appears to have won new adherents to the philosophy.\nContrast Underdogs Always Win, which takes this concept and flips it completely on its head.\n"}
{"SuperheroPrevalenceStages": "When it comes to settings that contain superheroes (or superpowered individuals by any other name), each setting or work can be ranked according to how common and well-known superpowers and superpowered beings are in it. For ease of categorization, we can divide this spectrum into three categories: Early, Middle, and Late stage. This refers not to the date of publication\u2014 an Early setting could be published very recently or a Late setting very long ago\u2014 but to the setting's progression from \"relatively down-to-Earth with a few Acceptable Breaks from Reality\" to \"wacky crazy crossover land where anything goes.\"\nThese three stages roughly correspond to the first three of The Ages Of Superhero Comics:\nThis correlation shows itself clearest in newly created superhero universes of each era. The Charlton Universe (1960) and the Lee-Kirby-Ditko Marvel Universe (1961) both began in the Early Stage and progressed to the Middle Stage within a year or so of publishing. Similarly, the Image Universe (1992) began as a Middle Stage universe and rapidly progressed to Late Stage. (Arguably, the only reason Image took any time at all to progress from Middle to Late was the necessary time to introduce a sufficiently large number of characters.)\nEarly Stage:\nMiddle Stage:\nLate Stage:\nAny setting that persists for any length of time will find itself naturally sliding toward the Later end of the spectrum as more characters and plot elements are added. Almost nothing short of a Cosmic Retcon can shift a setting the other way. On the other hand, individual works set in an established setting may very well display earlier stages, if the author chooses not to borrow too many superhuman elements from the overall setting for that particular work. Case in point: Batman Beyond, while set in the Late Stage DCAU, falls squarely into the Middle Stage itself.\nSee also Standard Super-Hero Setting.\nAnime and Manga\nComic Books\nFan Works\nLive Action TV\nMythology\nWestern Animation\nWeb Comics\nAnime and Manga\n Live Action TV\nMythology\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWestern Animation\nAnime and Manga\nComic Books\nLiterature\nLive Action TV\nMythology\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWeb Original\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"ImpersonatingTheEvilTwin": "The situation where Evil Twin is reversed \u2014 the Evil Twin isn't pretending to be the character, but instead the character is pretending to be the Evil Twin. Never mind that the original character hasn't studied the Evil Twin's typical mannerisms, knows nothing of his background and may not have his abilities. Never mind that the Evil Twin may be wearing a mask or equivalent which the real character can't take off since it's his real face. They look alike, so it has to work, right? In fact, it works more often than it should, often stopped only by gross problems (such as the real Evil Twin walking through the door), not by the dozens of flaws in the impersonation that nobody notices. Frequently it works because the Evil Twin's Mooks are too scared of him to question his changes in behavior.\nCompare with Hugh Mann, where an attempt to pass as human by a non-human is hilariously obvious. Sometimes exposed by a Bluff the Impostor maneuver. Subtrope to Identical Twin Mistake.\n"}
{"PlotArmour": "Lucky Bob! He's The Protagonist of a story, The Hero whose predestined role is to oppose \u2014 maybe even defeat \u2014 The Villain. Because he is essential to the plot, he can't be removed from the story until the final confrontation. Unfortunately, in inept hands, this makes his survival against the lesser threats he encounters seem less like skill and more like some sort of divine protection. He has the miraculous ability to evade death, serious wounds, and generally all lasting harm (until the plot calls for it). Even psychological damage can be held at bay by Bob's suit of Plot Armor.\nSometimes referred to as \"Script Immunity\" or a \"Character Shield\", Plot Armor is when a main character's life and health are safeguarded by the fact that he's the one person who can't be removed from the story. Therefore, whenever Bob is in a situation where he could be killed (or at the least very seriously injured), he comes out unharmed with no logical, In-Universe explanation.note\u00a0A typical explanation is that Bob survived through sheer luck on the basis of the Anthropic Principle. If only one person is going to survive the story, that person has to be Bob for there to be a story.\nBear in mind that having Plot Armor is not the same as being Nigh Invulnerable. When Superman takes a bullet to the eye and survives, that's his superhuman nature \u2014 there's an explanation, albeit a fantastic one, for how he comes out unharmed. When Indiana Jones survives the same thing, that's Plot Armor \u2014 the only explanation for his survival is that it's only halfway through the movie and you know he can't die yet. (Bonus points if he isn't even blinded.)\nThe downside to all this, of course, is that when it is Bob's time to die, nothing can save him. His inability to heal or escape death may seem just as illogical as his ability to avoid it was forty minutes ago, but alas, the plot gods giveth and the plot gods taketh away...\nTypically absent in episodes involving an Alternate Universe, Time Travel, or any other guaranteed-Reset Button situation. It is suspended when the Hero Killer is present and it is the main reason the Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy is still in business (along with a handful of other tropes).\nSub Tropes of this include:\nCompare Contractual Immortality (a meta trope where a character cannot truly be dead since his or her actor hasn't left the show) and Rule of Empathy (which may give Plot Armor to sympathetic non-protagonist characters, including villains).\nFor examples where important characters are just magnitudes stronger than the poor slobs who can't take even one hit, see Almost Lethal Weapons.\nContrasts with Anyone Can Die, Characters Dropping Like Flies, Plotline Death, Red Shirt (which is someone wearing a plot target), and Decoy Protagonist (the first focus character does not have Plot Armor, to subvert the audience's expectations)\nNot to be confused with the other kind of plot armor.\n"}
{"DangerousTerrain": "Dangerous Terrain is a phenomenon in which some portion of the battlefield between or below the hero and villain is dangerous to both parties. If Dangerous Terrain is present, be assured that at some point during the battle, the hero and villain will wind up in a shoving or wrestling match very nearby, trying to push each other into it. (In videogames, this is a Ring-Out Boss.)\nIf the terrain is deadly and not merely injurious (a Bottomless Pit, a Lava Pit, Spikes of Doom) one can expect the villain to end up dying in it at the end.\nThis is a subtrope of Interesting Situation Duel.\n"}
{"TheAllegedComputer": "It's a rusty old computer that takes over a minute to perform a simple operation. A beaten-up computer that restarts unexpectedly and at the last time you would like it to.\nThis is The Alleged Computer. This computer, to put it kindly, isn't the most viable to use to lollygag or search. In fact, you could probably benefit using an old mobile phone with internet capabilities over this type of \"computer\". Their best use is probably a novelty doorstop.\nIf it runs overly slowly or breaks with a single touch (or only works properly with a very strong touch), it definitely fits here. If a computer is actually much more efficient than it looks, see What a Piece of Junk.\nCompare The Alleged Car, The Alleged House, and The Alleged Steed for severely underperforming automobiles, homes, and horses. Also see No Backwards Compatibility in the Future and Our Graphics Will Suck in the Future.\nWalking Techbanes turn any computer around them into this trope.\n"}
{"CoolTank": "In large modern warfare engagements, infantry may as well be Cannon Fodder. You want something that can Hold the Line. Something with a BFG and/or More Dakka, crawler treads and (literal) tonnes of armor. You want a tank.\nReal Life tanks have large cannons to take on other tanks and fortifications, and (usually) secondary weapons to deal with infantry or aircraft. In fiction and reality, other tanks may use anti-infantry or anti-aircraft weapons instead of cannons.note\u00a0These do exist in Real Life, but they're not called tanks. To make the distinction even more difficult, many of these are based on existing tank chassis, so they look like tanks that have had their turrets swapped out. Cue journalists and the general public calling them \"tanks\" anyway. The tank's size and mobility may also be used as a weapon to crush people, cars, and walls. The armor is thick enough to stop small arms fire, most of it in the front, with the weakest areas being the rear, bottom and top. Expect enemies to take advantage of this for massive damage.\nOf course, the above paragraph refers to tanks around the size of today's main battle tanks. Sometimes that's not enough. They need to be bigger! Big enough to crush the other tanks! And carry loads of weapons! While racing donuts around them! No, we're not compensating for anything! And the armor is able to withstand Martian Death rays! And it has NBC protection! It's a FLIPPING BUNKER ON TRACKS. Oh, and the wheels on the tracks are equipped with armored gun pods.\nOther armored fighting vehicles, like armored personnel carriers, self-propelled artillery and tank destroyers may be called tanks. They're not. Don't be fooled! Likewise, don't listen to the deranged lunatics who keep wanting to put legs on them. Ridiculously impractical, that.\nRelated to Cool Car, Cool Bike, Cool Train, Base on Wheels, and other vehicle/warfare tropes\u2014this is basically Cool Tank. Has nothing to do with Shorttank, which makes you say Tank Goodness in a completely different way. Also has nothing to do with playing a damage-sponge character in an MMORPG, or with the oxygen storage unit strapped to the back of a SCUBA diver.\nFor armed tank-like vehicles, which have legs instead of good ol' treads, see Walking Tank. For ones which float, see Hover Tank. For ones that can travel underground, see Drill Tank. When the military geniuses of the world finally realize there is no firepower like battleship firepower, one may witnesses the ultimate tanks: Land Battleships. For when things in video games (such as people) act like tanks when they shouldn't, see Tank Controls. Sapient Tanks can think for themselves.\nWhen tanks are useless in media, see Tanks for Nothing. For inaccuracies with armoured vehicles, historical and otherwise, see Tanks, but No Tanks. For information on tanks and other armored vehicles, see Armored Fighting Vehicles.\nIf you looked up Mechanized Infantry and expected to see a giant robot with a gun, try looking up Real Robot instead. For tank engines like Thomas the Tank Engine, see Cool Train.\nAlthough the \"tank\" class/role in video games gets its name from the role of literal tanks, they have nothing to do with this trope.\n"}
{"AMagicContractComesWithAKiss": "In fantasy based fictions, it is a recurring feature that weaker heroes would enter into a contract with a stronger being for protection or any other deal. But wait! What if they are required to enter into a contract using a kiss? Then, this is A Magic Contract Comes with a Kiss. This is a sister trope to Magic Contract Romance.\nNote: Whilst Magic Contract Romance is only when a romance is ensued between the contractee and the contractor, this trope is the kiss that initiates the contract. Know the difference.\nThis is a subtrope of Magic Kiss.\n"}
{"PowerStrainBlackOut": "It can be hard to show all the aspects of a fictional ability since such a thing does not have any Real Life context to which the audience can relate. So when a creator wants to show that using a special power takes a toll on a character, he will often have the character faint afterward.\nThis is especially true when the character uses a power for the first time because they might overdo it due to inexperience. Presumably, the strain of using it is too much for them, causing their mind to shut down in self defense.\nThis is frequently used for powers that aren't flashy in order to make them seem more dramatic, such as telepathy and other Psychic Powers.\nIf the fainting is a symptom of a more serious health problem, it's also a case of Heroic RRoD. When it happens the first time a power is used, it's related to How Do I Shot Web?. Can be a form of Blessed with Suck.\nIf the collapse is after a dramatic win, especially a battle, and is used to skip the boring aftermath, it's Post-Victory Collapse.\nCompare to Fainting Seer, which may overlap for Seers. May overlap with Cast from Lifespan. Subtrope of Fainting.\n"}
{"Slutshaming": "Slut-Shaming is the act of making someone feel bad for their promiscuity, by linking higher promiscuity with lower worth as a human being.\nSlut-Shaming is directed against women far more often than against men, not least because of the cultural perception that sex is something men do to women. Thus, one 19th/20th Century Sino-European Double Standard holds that a man who has sex is just \"being a man\", whereas a woman who has sex is Defiled Forever \u2014 a font of moral corruption who will make the people around her lazy hedonists. Yet, the men are often free to admire or even have sex with the \"sluts\", while despising them at the same time. An alternative view, extant since the 19th century, is that because men are sometimes seen as innately slutty, calling one a slut doesn't mean much.\nAlthough the slut stereotype is not commonly applied to men, that is not to say that it cannot or does not directly harm them as well. For example, if men are always willing to have sex, then a man can't be sexually assaulted, because how could he not want it? Indeed, a man who is shamed for sexual promiscuity is more likely to be painted as a predator than as a slut.\n\"Higher promiscuity\" is extremely relative from one society to another, and often from one victim to another, depending on age, race, class, etc. What you wear, how you act, what you do, who you do, all can be ammunition against you. People can shame victims on the basis of (or allegations of):\nThese next ones don't count as long as you only do them with your wife/husband.\nCharacters will heroically engage in Slut-Shaming in works that play the My Girl Is Not a Slut trope straight, while Slut-Shaming will be played unsympathetically in works that insist promiscuity is good and say My Girl Is a Slut.\nThose who engage in Slut-Shaming doubt the existence of the Ethical Slut and often are portrayed as Moral Guardians who insist Sex Is Evil. Sensible Heroes, Skimpy Villains is a form of sister trope. See also Madonna\u2013Whore Complex and My Girl Is Not a Slut. Compare Sour Prudes and Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny. Compare All Men Are Perverts, which when applied judgmentally can be considered a society-wide form of Slut-Shaming leveled against an entire gender. Contrast Virgin-Shaming when a character is ridiculed for being a virgin instead of not being one.\nNote: Please refrain from virgin-shaming when adding examples. If people can pursue casual sexual experience without being judged, they should also be able to choose abstinence without being labelled a \"prude\".\n"}
{"LovecraftOnFilm": "H. P. Lovecraft's stories, despite a (sometimes deserved) reputation for being uncinematic and exposition-heavy, have spawned a surprising number of film adaptations. These run the gamut from clever and respectful tributes to cynical schlock. Few have had any budget to speak of, and none but the most tenuously-linked have attained mainstream success, but all have a certain level of cult cachet.\n"}
{"RatMen": "Ratmen are the rat equivalent of Lizard Folk: an entire race of intelligent anthropomorphic rodents or a single specimen thereof. They may be villainous creatures that live in filth and squalor, reproduce at a dizzying rate and worship foul deities, just another humanoid race with no particularly outstanding good or bad traits, or simply victims of an unwanted transformation. They may be (or descend from) rodents that developed humanoid features or humans that developed rodent features, whether through magic, science, radiation or natural selection.\nRatman supervillains often have either \"rat\" or \"vermin\" somewhere in their names. Ratman civilizations are sometimes given a quasi-Japanese flair or called \"Nezumi,\" which is simply the Japanese word for mouse or rat; the proper Japanese translation for Ratmen would be \"Nezumi-jin.\"\nSubtrope of Petting Zoo People. Contrast Rodents of Unusual Size (where the rodents are huge but not humanoid or intelligent).\nNote when adding examples: do not confuse ratmen with wererats: the latter are humans who can assume the form of a rat (or a giant rat, a human-rat hybrid, etc). Normal-sized rodents with human mannerisms do not count unless they are explicitly called out as abnormal in the fiction they appear. Refer to Sliding Scale of Anthropomorphism for guidance.note\u00a0Wrong examples would be Tom and Jerry, The Great Mouse Detective, An American Tail, Capitol Critters, Cinderella's mouse friends, all rats from Ratatouille, Rizzo the Rat from The Muppet Show, Mickey Mouse, the Jews in Maus, the Rat King from The Nutcracker.\n"}
{"AnachronisticSoundtrack": "Sometimes a work's soundtrack is composed of popular songs chosen from a different era than the film's setting. This can apply to either diegetic music (the characters in the work can hear the music) or non-diegetic music (they're part of the soundtrack, but the characters can't hear them).\nThere are two basic variations:\nCan also be done for Rule of Cool. Note that this specifically references when the film's soundtrack is from a different time than when the film is set not from when the film is made. A Period Piece does not count if it uses period-accurate music, like Rock of Ages. Sometimes the movie doesn't even attempt to justify why they're doing this. Typically this does not apply to classical music, which is always going to be older than the time in which a work is set. A staple of Class Reunion movies, with the soundtrack being selected from the era in which the protagonists went to high school, not the time they're living in 10+ years later.\nCompare Soundtrack Dissonance. Can overlap with Nothing but Hits.\n"}
{"SkinWalker": "A Skin Walker, also known as a \"yee naaldlooshii\" (Navajo for \"by means of it, he/she/it walks around on four legs\") is usually a person with the supernatural ability to change their form into either an animal or another human being.\nBeing very similar to Werewolves, and other paranormal shape changers, most skin walkers' abilities are largely powered by dark ritual, and the breaking of native taboos (such as cannibalism, incest and murder, especially of family members) or are heralded to create them. Each tribe's version differs in details. Most Skinwalkers are differentiated from their brethren by being able to take multiple shapes, but are not free-form shapeshifters. The myths usually describe them as humans who wear only an animal skin, or an abomination of human and animal forms.\nPrimarily detailed in many Native American tales, these entities are sometimes portrayed as either practicing witches, or aspects of the trickster deity (Coyote) or something worse, from the shared mythology of many indigenous American peoples. Skinwalkers are considered one of the most fearsome monsters from Native American Mythology. In those myths, they have a few extra powers, including Telepathy, Voice Changeling (mimicking animal and human sounds) and the creation of poisonous/disease ridden \"Witch Powder\" or the Magical Eye. Some cannot fully shift into their animal forms and have a deformity (awkward gait, over-sized feet, etc.) revealing their true nature.\nKilling one is either simplified to accusing the creature in public while in human form (which robs it of power and it dies in 3 days) or an involved, lengthy ritual.\nRelated to Voluntary Shapeshifting, Magical Native American. See also Our Werebeasts Are Different. Of late, it's been connected to Berserkers and more often than not, used as a shorthand by writers for \"American Werewolf.\"\n"}
{"ElementalHair": "Hair color is an easy visual shorthand for getting information about a character to the audience. Most often, hair color will tell you something about the character's personality, but sometimes, its meaning is something else: this character has an Elemental Power and the hair color to match the element. Quite often, their personality will also be tied to their element and thus their hair color.\nThis is less common in Live-Action media than in animation, video games, comic books, or manga, for obvious reasons.\nSister trope to Elemental Eye Colors. Subtrope of Color-Coded Elements, Colour-Coded for Your Convenience, and Astonishingly Appropriate Appearance. Often overlaps with You Gotta Have Blue Hair. Compare Flaming Hair, which is this trope for fire elemental users taken Up to Eleven.\n"}
{"XenoFiction": "A few works of Science Fiction and Fantasy (and, in some cases even realistic fiction) take the Point of View of normal animals, Intellectual Animals, Intelligent Gerbils, or Starfish Aliens. More than that, the creators of such stories take great pains to think through what it would actually be like to be a rabbit, a dolphin, or a giant betentacled being who smells colour.\nA good rule of thumb for figuring out if something is in this genre or not: if you can replace the non-humans with (maybe superpowered) humans without too much trouble, it's probably not Xenofiction: Beast Fables and works about Funny Animals are, in general, not examples. Likewise in many a Mouse World, size is often the only major difference between humans and non-humans; though there is Xenofiction featuring non-humans with great differences in size.\nIf it's taking place under the nose of humans, there may or may not have a Masquerade, and humans will probably either be bastards or eldritch abominations.

{"MugglesDoitBetter": "In a Speculative Fiction setting, there are often a lot of people going on about how incredible and powerful the Phlebotinum is, which is why people who have it are the ones who move the plot rather than all the ordinary Muggles who need to be rescued.\nExcept, sometimes, the superhuman devices or abilities in the story aren't really all that earthshaking, at least not compared to the more mundane methods available. Sure, being able to create fire with your mind might be neat, but if it's not on a large enough scale, you might be better off with a handheld lighter. And a Trick Arrow that electrocutes people could be useful, but we do already have stun guns. And that guy saying he'll Take Over the World now that he's got skin as strong as steel? Yeah, apparently he's never heard of armor piercing bullets. Of course, if they don't work, there's always the Nuclear Option.\nSometimes the usefulness of Muggle methods will be a big part of the story, like Van Helsing using modern scientific methods against vampires in Dracula (1931). Other times supernatural abilities and Muggle abilities will be kept largely separate thanks to the Masquerade, but when they do intersect the superiority/equality of Muggle methods will be clear. And then there are some stories where it's clear the writers didn't really think about what ordinary people could contribute, but the fans certainly will.\nThere are two ways this trope can go, if it isn't used correctly. In some cases, it applies if and only if the Muggles are Crazy-Prepared. A girl who freezes you at will may be able to kill regular soldiers easily, but if they have insulated suits specifically to fight her, well, then it becomes a teenage girl with a useless power vs. a squad of heavily-armed, trained soldiers. And one-sided fights aren't very entertaining. Usually. On the flipside, it can become unsatisfying fast if Fridge Logic sets in and critically-thinking viewers recognise that the only reason the Muggles win is because the supers are holding Idiot Balls, suffering from Misapplied Phlebotinum and using Hollywood Tactics rather than embracing the true potential available. For example, smart audiences may wonder why supers do not use guns when muggles do. Trying to get this trope to work well may involve a delicate balancing act.\nRelated to, but distinct from, a Mundane Solution, which is where the Phlebotinum is given a specific weakness to some commonplace thing that it didn't necessarily have to have. See also Weaponized Weakness, when muggle methods are used to exploit an already dangerous Achilles' Heel or Weaksauce Weakness.\nThis trope is the main power and indeed the only hope of the Un-Sorcerer. Also a key characteristic of the Badass Normal, who utilize such methods in a way to keep up with (and sometimes defeat) the other superpowered beings of the universe. Can also lead to The Magic Versus Technology War, with the Tech Level being that of the present day.\nCompare with Kinetic Weapons Are Just Better, which is when mundane weapons work better than fancy shiny phlebotinum-powered weapons, though not necessarily as sometimes the \"mundane\" weapons are pretty phleotinum-loaded too. Compare Postmodern Magik, which is when technology and magic intertwine. Also compare to Medieval Stasis, as this trope assumes the supernatural is locked in such while the muggles continue to advance. Contrast Guns Are Worthless, where those fancy muggle toys are, well, worthless in the face of a supernatural threat.\nUnrelated to Tropers Do It Without Notability.\n"}
{"LeadIn": "1. A Lead In is a mini story which occurs before the main plot. It is used to warm up the audience and set up the events which lead to the main story. Aside from being a catalyst, it usually has very little relevance to the rest of the episode. It may also be used to stretch the script to a sufficient length.\nA Lead In differs from The Teaser in that:\nA lead-in and a teaser are similar in that they both serve to bring the audience into the story.\nA lot of TV viewers will watch a programme, then decide to watch the thing that is on next.\nTherefore, having the right show before you can make a huge difference in your ratings- often over a million viewers (Lost in the UK shed 1.3 million viewers between premiere and its next showing; Big Brother wasn't on for the second week).\nStations compete to get good lead-ins for their local news broadcasts. At 5 or 6, it's usually a syndicated show, at 11 it's usually a network show. So, the NBC affiliate would often win the 11 o'clock ratings battle back when ER was on top at 10, and whoever gets Oprah will win at 5.\nThis is important, since all the local news broadcasts are more or less interchangeable in the mind of the viewer, and it's also usually the only ad revenue the station doesn't have to share with the network or syndicate. This was one of the reasons The Jay Leno Show, which was demonstrably hurting the 10/11 p.m. newscasts of NBC affiliates, was cancelled.\n"}
{"WackyHomeroom": "The Wacky Homeroom occurs when there are students, all in one class, that have distinctly quirky personalities, such as Alpha Bitch, Brainless Beauty, etc. The students may make up the Five-Man Band archetype, or perhaps many of them will be Cloudcuckoolanders with an Only Sane Man thrown in to represent the audience and/or contrast all the wackiness.\nIf there's some focus on the teacher, expect to see Sensei-chan, the Absentminded Professor, and/or the Misplaced Kindergarten Teacher heading up the group. Either way, hijinks usually ensue.\nRule of Funny and/or Rule of Cool often applies.\n"}
{"FirstPersonSnarker": "So it turns out we need to have an article about the First-Person Smartass, and now I have to tell you everything about the type of narrator who's a first-person narrator (because you obviously didn't get that from the name) and describes events in the tone of a Deadpan Snarker. He does this since he knows that, contrary to the popular misconception, narration isn't about, y\u2019know, letting the reader in on the plot; it's about sharing with them every remotely entertaining half-of-a-train of thought you have.\nThis guy sometimes shows up in the Private Eye Monologue sort of work, but Urban Fantasy is where you really can't turn a corner without bumping into a dozen of them. If you want to find one, just cast a fireball in some otherwise normal city and before you're halfway done, some wannabe-protagonist will jump at you from behind a corner and start throwing pithy remarks at you about how you're being clich\u00e9 and violating the laws of thermodynamics or some shit like that.\nWell, fine, that's...hyperbole, I suppose...but you have to admit the guy is an awfully convenient proxy to have around if you're a clever author who wants to show the world how clever you are. Not to mention he can also function as an Audience Surrogate, incorporating and defusing a reader's skepticism with endless Lampshade Hanging of whatever bits of the story don't make sense. You can almost feel the enormous weight of the entire story's Willing Suspension of Disbelief crushing this poor bastard\u2019s shoulders.\nYou can expect this guy to be intellectual and well-acquainted with pop culture (or at least works with which the author is familiar), so he can make all the right clever references at the right time. Naturally, this won't prevent them from being described as uneducated, bad at school, or just plain Book Dumb; these traits are apparently all the fucking rage for Audience Surrogates nowadays as people can't identify with someone who might possibly be a better person than they are. Unfortunately the character may end up being too smart, because the writer is afraid of looking stupid. In the case of Fan Fiction, a character of only moderate intelligence may end up being given uncharacteristically intelligent thoughts, and leaving the readers with a sense of OOC-ness.\nAnyways, the Trope Namer was a review of Steven Brust's Dragaera series by The Library of Babel. And of course you're going to click that, because the \"click hither and educate thyself\" tone of that sentence just screams \"fun.\"\nCompare Lemony Narrator. Or don\u2019t, I don\u2019t care how lazy you are.\n...I don\u2019t like my job.\n"}
{"ParentChildIncest": "Something often depicted in media as much squickier than Brother\u2013Sister Incest, Twincest or Kissing Cousins is incest between a parent and their child. Sigmund Freud had a lot to say about the Oedipus and Electra complexes, and could find subtext in quite a lot of places. But in Big Screwed Up Families, Deadly Decadent Courts, particularly abusive households and elsewhere, one is likely to find examples of this trope.\nWhen this trope shows up in media, it's usually used to highlight the specific psychological issues that a character has, particularly if it features in the backstory of a Serial Killer or other psychopath, or to give an already nasty villain that extra bit of shudder factor. When the parent is the aggressor in the relationship, it is usually quite predatory in nature, and in many cases (particularly in the case of fathers and daughters), it's a crossing of the Moral Event Horizon when it's revealed. If the child is the aggressor in the relationship, it usually means he or she is seriously twisted in some way or in the very least has serious issues. Sometimes this is played for Black Comedy, particularly in the case of mothers and sons, with the son understandably freaked out due to the mother's advances.\nThis trope appears with step, foster, or adoptive parents as well as biological ones, sometimes to Bowdlerise it somewhat, although the power dynamics are still much the same as in parent/child incest. Wife Husbandry is one way to Bowdlerise it still further \u2014 though not out of Squick range.\nThis is a type of Unequal Pairing, since the parent is almost always at least psychologically if not always physically in a much more powerful position than the child. See also Rape as Backstory and Abusive Parents.\nAlso see Surprise Incest, where the couple involved do not know they're related, as well as Brother\u2013Sister Incest, Creepy Uncle, and Kissing Cousins. When children innocently suggest this, it's Father, I Want to Marry My Brother. See Pervert Dad for parents who don't quite go this far, but still have an (un)healthy dose of weirdness. See I Love You, Vampire Son, when the \"parent\" is the vampire that sired his \"son\".\n"}
{"ManOfKryptonite": "If a character has an Achilles' Heel \u2014 and especially if they have a Weaksauce Weakness \u2014 inevitably an opponent comes along who is basically made of or otherwise works solely in the medium of Weaksauce. Examples abound, especially in DC Comics. This trope is essentially the ultra-specific, ultra-literalist version of Good Hurts Evil or No Man of Woman Born. Less commonly, a character with no existing vulnerability ends up against a character who introduces a unique weakness of theirs.\nAs these characters revolve around possessing an innate advantage over the hero, writers often have them fall victim to Crippling Overspecialization to avoid letting them dominate the story. If the power they rely on is an especially obscure weakness, they can often fall to humiliating defeats by opponents vastly beneath their primary target who don\u2019t suffer the same handicap, or at least not as severely. Even worse for those confronted with their main target if they happen to acquire a Kryptonite-Proof Suit to deal with them on a more level playing field. This tends to lead to examples of this trope to become relatively minor villains and all but useless when away from their chosen prey. The few villains that are skilled, intelligent, and powerful enough to avoid this fate are usually regulated to the upper echelons of the Sorting Algorithm of Evil for the sake of story balance.\nFor obvious reasons, this is primarily a Comic Book Trope.\nClosely related to Kryptonite Is Everywhere and Depleted Phlebotinum Shells. Counterpart to the Kung Fu-Proof Mook. Combine both to create a That One Boss or worse. Contrast This Looks Like a Job for Aquaman, which occurs when a situation is tailored to avoid a hero's Weaksauce Weakness and utilize their lame power of heart. If the hero manages to defeat this character anyway, it's a form of Scissors Cuts Rock.\n"}
{"MyKungFuIsStronger": "In shows where mano-a-mano combat is a main plot element, characters spend much of their lives training and improving their strength so they can one-up each other at a critical point in a fight. This invariably develops into an arms race that can, and has, taken out entire planets and solar systems.\nThis has a grain of truth in it, as between two equally skilled fighters, the deciding factor will often be one's strength.\nCompare Weak, but Skilled, and contrast Unskilled, but Strong. If two nations do this, it's a Lensman Arms Race. When the situation is about equipment and weapons rather than physical prowess, see Bigger Stick. If two Rules Lawyers do this, it's My Rule-Fu Is Stronger Than Yours. Also The Greatest Style, where one form of \"kung fu\" really is stronger than another.\n"}
{"ConvenientlyTimedGuard": "The lead character has just successfully carried out their tricky infiltration of some high-security facility and copied the information/stolen the technology/rescued the prisoner/what-have-you. Just as they're done, in wanders some random security guard, who sounds the alarm. Cue the action sequence.\nBasically it's a way for a Spy Drama to have its cake and eat it too. You want to see a perfectly-executed piece of espionage, but you also want to see the lead kicking and shooting and fleeing? Throw in some nicely-timed security personnel and you can have it both ways. Although sometimes you have to wonder, did the question \"What do we do about the security patrol?\" never even come up during planning? In Spy Fiction, the fact that the enemy would quickly realise that their secret files had been stolen also rarely seems to come up.\nOtherwise, this trope is something of an example of Truth in Television. It is surprising how many crimes are stopped because police or security forces happened to show up at just the wrong time for the criminals, or someone saw something and called the police.\nRelated to Contrived Coincidence and possible Diabolus ex Machina. See Clairvoyant Security Force for the Video Game related variant.\nAnime and Manga\nLive-Action Television\nVideo Games\nWeb Original\n"}
{"ExitVillainStageLeft": "Once their plot is foiled the villain (less often, a hero) will always get away in the most undignified and cowardly fashion imaginable. If they didn't, who would the hero fight next episode? This is probably why the heroes either don't even bother chasing them, or else send Red Shirts after them with predictable results, or even help them get away. Other times, they're just being sporting.\nNo blockades, no manhunts, not even pursued by a bear. After all, it's at the end of the episode.\nRegardless of the means, the escaped Smug Snake will gloat about how it \"all went according to plan\", maybe set off the Self-Destruct Mechanism in the Collapsing Lair, and return \"triumphantly\" next episode. Less often, you'll see them lick their figurative and literal wounds at having not only been beat, but forced to show the better part of valour and try to come up with a new Plot Of The Week that will work, throwing in a \"Next Time, Tropeworthy!\" for good measure.\nMost villains who exit stage left also favor the Friend or Idol Decision and Sadistic Choice as backups, setting off small bombs or traps on loved ones to force the hero to choose between their capture or their friends' lives. This also frequently happens with Genre Blind villains who leave the hero in an easily defeated Death Trap room rather than stay and make sure the job gets done correctly, i.e. Just Shoot Him.\nMay be accompanied by a Hiss Before Fleeing, an Angry Fist-Shake or shouting \"We Will Meet Again\". See also Screw This, I'm Outta Here! for when the mooks try this. Compare So Long, Suckers!, Karma Houdini and Know When to Fold 'Em. Contrast with Last Villain Stand where the villain decides to stick around and fight to the end.\nThere may be unmarked spoilers ahead!\n"}
{"WebcomicTime": "Related to Comic-Book Time, Webcomic Time takes place when the events of a serialized story take place over a shorter (in-universe) time than the (real-life) time it takes for the story to be produced.\nThis occurs because it usually takes more time to create an artistically pleasing depiction of an event happening than it does for the event to actually occur. Drawing a twenty page comic book could take weeks, but all twenty pages of the comic could very well be spent on a single conversation. While this can be counteracted by skipping over large stretches of time between scenes (or, for prose stories, describing scenes very tersely), if events in the story mostly happen one right after the other (and are given any degree of detail) it can be hard to keep this from happening. It's especially common in Webcomics, hence the name.\nThis can also happen due to the series missing deadlines or going on hiatus and being unable to make up for the lost time.\nOver time, this slippage can add up to years; topical references early on may become incredibly dated later, even if it was supposed to take place on the same day. This especially affects Two Gamers on a Couch series, since technological progress can quickly make references to new consoles and top-of-the-line gaming machines obsolete. If Exponential Plot Delay gets involved, things can get really bad. Though remember, Tropes Are Not Bad as this can sometimes benefit the story.\nThere are several ways authors compensate for this:\nThis doesn't (necessarily) apply to stories that are set outside of the present day, except for cases where it does, such as if an in-universe character decides to hang a lampshade on the relation to real time.\nIn yet another example of Tropes Are Not Bad, Webcomic Time really isn't a problem, just a fun little thing to hang that lampshade on.\n"}
{"FixedFloorFighting": "A Fighting Game trope where the action all takes place on one stable plane. Fights here tend to be more technical, as the simplified stages offer less chance for unpredictability. The limited range of action means combos may likely be continued longer than in a Free Floor Fighting game, as there is less variation for where an opponent, or the stage, may go.\nThis type of level design may be somewhat tied to the Polygon Ceiling in Long-Runners. This type of fight may promote the Perfect-Play A.I.. May be the result of the Invisible Wall or Insurmountable Waist-High Fence.\nContrast Free Floor Fighting.\n"}
{"EvolvingCredits": "As the name suggests, this is when the Title Sequence or closing credits of a series are slowly altered over the course of its run, by updating or replacing scenes to reflect major changes that have happened over previous episodes. This is a popular way of avoiding a Spoiler Opening for more plot-driven shows, usually mysteries, by having major characters who haven't been introduced or background characters with hidden importance initially being silhouettes or not appearing at all.\nIn the case of anime or other shows being aired outside their home country, these changed credits may or may not carry over into foreign broadcasts, with overseas airings using only the first version of the credits or different ones entirely instead.\nCompare Evolving Music and Evolving Title Screen. Not to be confused with Title Sequence Replacement, where the title sequence for even previous episodes is changed for syndication and rerun purposes.\n"}
{"AnonymousAuthor": "An author who doesn't want their authorship known will use a Pen Name. An author who wants everyone to know they don't want their authorship known will use Anonymous, or a pen name that very obviously presents itself as a pen name.\nThis is done to convey the impression \u2014 which may even be true \u2014 that the author would be in trouble were his or her identity known. So it's often done with controversial works, or works that wish to present themselves as such, and with exposes.\nCompare Pen Name and Alan Smithee. Contrast Same Face, Different Name, where the pseudonym may not even be particularly opaque and serves largely to emphasize Genre Adultery.\n"}
{"ImpracticallyFancyClothes": "Basically, this trope is about outfits that are perfectly wearable, but they're just for show, not for practical use.\nReasons they are impractical are many. The most common one is the outfit is just too expensive to risk damage from actually wearing it. The outfit could also be heavy and/or hot. Or the fabric and/or trimmings would make it too delicate. Either way, the outfit is best used only when the wearer wants to, well, look his/her best.\nThe line where an outfit becomes impractical can depend on the outfit's purpose. If it's a dress for a black-tie dinner, it could have quite a few trimmings and still work. If it's for construction, the only accessories should be tool belts and safety gear. But let's say the company is shooting an ad, and the agency thinks the normal construction outfit isn't cool enough. So they throw on a few pieces of gear that look as though they fit, at least to those not familiar with construction work. That would be an Impractically Fancy Outfit.\nThere are some jobs where such outfits actually are practical, in the sense that part of the job is showing off the outfit. This includes showgirls and certain modeling jobs. If you see an outfit on a runway that looks as if it's just the designer showing off, it probably is.\nImpractically fancy outfits can also advertise wealth and status, showing that the wearer doesn't have to do physical work, can afford to risk damaging an expensive outfit, and (in extreme cases) can afford servants to help with dressing and undressing.\nIs often a feature of the patrons of the Coolest Club Ever. Is practically the uniform for a classical princess.\nOften overlaps with Gorgeous Period Dress and Impossibly Cool Clothes.\nA Sub-Trope of Costume Porn.\nA Super Trope to:\nCompare Stylish Protection Gear (which is always fancy, but not always impractical), Ermine Cape Effect (the belief that royalty and nobility walk around in these clothes all the time).\n"}
{"NotWearingPants": "A stock dream where the subject finds themselves in a familiar social institution (usually school or the workplace) wearing only their underwear, or sometimes nothing at all. This is often coupled with a high-pressure task (such as an examination or a deadline), and the thought that you have somehow forgotten to get dressed this morning. In many cases no one else in the dream notices the dreamer isn't wearing enough clothes until the dreamer themselves notice at which point they typically react by pointing and laughing at the dreamer.\nUsually, this trope is invoked to simply indicate that the person is dreaming. When played straight, it is simply embarrassing, and not in the least bit erotic or terror-inducing. And it will never, ever be prophetic... although in comedy, it's occasionally subverted by having the \"bad dream\" turn out to not be a dream at all.\nThis kind of dream is definitely Truth in Television and quite common in fact, though perhaps not as much as media shows it, nor always with the same structure and conclusion. After all, Real Dreams Are Weirder.\nA Sub-Trope of Anxiety Dreams. See also Fully-Clothed Nudity.\nSee also Out-of-Clothes Experience and Comedic Underwear Exposure. Not to be confused with Pants-Free (a specific sight gag where someone is revealed to be partly undressed Behind the Black); the everyday attire of a Half-Dressed Cartoon Animal; a superhero who is Not Wearing Tights; or situations where a character isn't wearing pants but doesn't care. Also not to be confused with Going Commando. Expect Goofy Print Underwear to make an appearance in most cases of this.\nThe inversion is Nude-Colored Clothes. To a British audience this trope would be \"only wearing pants\", since in Britain \"pants\" are what Americans call \"underpants\". \"Not wearing pants\" in Britain would either be \"going commando\" or \"completely nude\".\nIf someone finds themselves unexpectedly naked in public when they're awake, see Naked People Trapped Outside.\nCrashing Dreams may have this as Five-Second Foreshadowing the character is about to wake up naked and awkward. See also Cringe Comedy.\n"}
{"SatisfiedStreetrat": "The Satisfied Street Rat is a character archetype common to more cynical works that has the following characteristics:\nFrequently Anti Heroes, and often Byronic Heroes. The degree to which the character is well-adjusted versus is harboring a lot of pain inside depends on the writer. See also Wrong Side of the Tracks, Neighbourhood-Friendly Gangsters. As children they are more likely to have been The Artful Dodger rather than the Street Urchin, but the Dodger is more of a trickster where the Street Rat is more of a cutthroat. May have been raised by The Fagin. Those who knew the Street Rat as a more vulnerable child may see them as a case of From Nobody to Nightmare in adulthood.\n"}
{"WhateverMancy": "A standard naming convention for specialized magic- (or magic-equivalent-) users; they are referred to as somethingmancers, and their specialized form of magic is called somethingmancy. The something is usually the Greek word for the thing or some other acceptably important-sounding term for it. As an example, death mages are known throughout all of fiction as necromancers. This structure makes it quite easy to create names for branches of magic using just about anything you can think of. You use fire? You're a pyromancer. Water? Hydromancer. Ice and cold? Cryomancer. It's that simple.\nA very pervasive trope, and old enough that it's very prone to being played with.\nA notable variant is when people with Psychic Powers get classified by the suffixes \"Kineticist\" and \"Kinesis\". So a fiery psychic is a pyrokineticist/pyrokinetic, a water-controlling psychic is a hydrokinetic, a cold-manipulating psychic is a cryokinetic and so on with the endless possibilities of Greek and Pseudo Greek. Also if a work features a Fantastic Science, there's a good chance that it's going to have a similar naming scheme.\nTechnically, the -mancy and -kinesis suffixes are both misnomers. \"Mantia\" stands for divination, making \"Necromancy\" the mystical practice of communicating with the dead but not necessarily bringing them Back from the Dead. \"Kinesis\" is \"Movement\", and thus might refer to being able to manipulate something but not will it into being. A more appropriate term would be \"-urgy\", meaning \"work\" or \"shaping\", but conjoining it with a term requires the first part to end with a consonant (as in, \"Metallurgy\"). See the analysis tab for further details.\nSee Necromancy for a common specific subtrope. The Pornomancer sounds like a subtrope, but only uses the same naming convention.\n"}
{"TroubleFollowsYouHome": "There's You Can't Go Home Again, there's Stranger in a Familiar Land, and then there's this.\nBasically, this is when a character who wants to escape some nastiness, or probably he just defeated the nastiness, and finally returns home... and sees that the nastiness is there, too.\nIt can happen in the middle of the plot or be a finale. In case of the former, it can trigger Let's Get Dangerous! or give the unlucky homecomer a level in badass when he finally decides to give the nastiness a fight. In case of the latter, it can be a Shoot the Shaggy Dog ending.\n"}
{"FlashbackArc": "An episode consisting mainly of one or more Flashbacks.\nSometimes this is used to tell a story that takes place before the series began. Other times this is used as a variant form of a Framing Device such as a Captain's Log to allow the character to comment on the action with the benefit of hindsight.\nWhen the action takes place before the beginning of the series, the flashback is often used to show how the characters met. Occasionally, it will be combined with A Day in the Limelight, showing the true depths of a character while at the same time letting the audience see what made this person be like they are.\nOccasionally the flashback takes place some time between episodes during the run of the series, especially if it has a Time Skip.\nWhen the flashbacks consist of previously recorded footage, you get a Clip Show, likely done in a Recap Episode.\nSpecific variants: How We Got Here, How Dad Met Mom (sometimes), and \"Rashomon\"-Style.\n"}
{"ExPy": "An expy (short \"exported character\") is a character from one series who is unambiguously and deliberately based on a character in another, older series. A few minor traits, such as age or hair color, may change, but there's no doubt that they are almost one and the same. They often turn up in different works by the same writer(s) or production team.\nThis can simply be the tendency of writers to prefer certain characterizations for important characters (or knowing which ones are most marketable/popular), or the influence of the design process. On the other hand, it may just be a bad attempt to try to revive a character who the writer liked, but nobody else did and had to get rid of it. When by a different author, it may be an homage to the original creator and/or character. In the negative sense, an expy can be seen as just a bloated, gimmicky version of a perfectly serviceable past character. In a positive sense, it can refer to an \"upgrade\" of a two-dimensional or otherwise limited character to one more appreciably complex.\nRemember that Tropes Are Not Bad; an expy can give an old character concept a new lease on life, take it in a different direction, adapt it to a new medium, or simply do something with it that's as good or better than the original. Iconic characters like Yogi Bear and Mickey Mouse are obvious clones of Art Carney and Felix the Cat respectively, but that hasn't stopped them from being among the most acclaimed cartoon characters of all time.\nTheory: any Characters as Device trope, if taken to the extreme, can result in the character appearing to be a mere expy of the Trope Codifiers for that trope. Especially if the character is Flanderized to the point of having few defining characteristics outside of the trope they represent. See Fountain of Expies.\nMost often seen in animation and video games, where it's much easier to make a newer character resemble an older one. Occasionally happens when characters from different stories end up sharing voice actors, making or even forcing their personalities to look even more similar, which often leads to jokes based on the voice actor's former role.\nWhen the character appears in the same series as the previous character, they're often a Suspiciously Similar Substitute.\nThe key difference between this and Captain Ersatz is that an expy, while deliberately based on some other character, is still their own person, while Captain Ersatz is obviously the same character but with the Serial Numbers Filed Off. Please keep this distinction in mind before adding an example here. Also note that a fictional counterpart to a real-life person would not be an expy. When a character strongly resembles a real person, rather than a fictional character, that's No Celebrities Were Harmed. If the character is meant as an homage without being identical, it could be a Shout-Out instead. A quick glance around TV Tropes will reveal just how often these mistakes are made on this very wiki.\nRemember that an Expy must be a clearly deliberate reference on the part of the author; superficial or random coincidental similarities (even very striking ones) do not qualify, so if you aren't certain, they probably are not an Expy. Because many character archetypes and tropes that compose characters are universal, it is easy for readers to fall into thinking that a particular character in the same general archetype resembles someone from their favorite show or novel, especially when Small Reference Pools lead readers to overestimate the cultural impact of their favorite characters.\nSpiritual Successor is a similar trope scaled up to an entire work, and thus as a result often features Expies of characters from the original work.\nCompare to Bleached Underpants, Alternate Company Equivalent, Name's the Same, Roman \u00e0 Clef, Similar Squad, Same Story, Different Names, Suspiciously Similar Song, Distaff Counterpart, Surprisingly Similar Stories, Evil Counterpart, Whole Plot Reference. Not to be confused with XP, nor XP.\nContrast In Name Only, Transplanted Character Fic.\nFor specific characters that tend to inspire expies, see Fountain of Expies. For a series with numerous different expies in its cast, see Cast of Expies. When an expy and the character that inspired are both found in the same universe, then you have Expy Coexistence.\n"}
{"ColdOpening": "Also known as a Cold Opening or \"Cold Open\". A one to five minute mini-act at the beginning of the show, sometimes before the opening credits, that is used to set up the episode and catch the audience's attention.\nIn a Monster of the Week show such as The X-Files, the teaser usually contains the first Red Shirt of the episode. In a Crime and Punishment Series, it usually contains the first murder or the body of a victim being discovered. It has become something of a fashion, particularly on crime shows, to end the cold open with a Quip to Black.\nThough it technically does not really set up the plot, as there is usually no lengthy continuous plot, the first sketch right before the opening credits in sketch comedy shows like Saturday Night Live and MADtv is also called a cold opening. (The show Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip actually had an episode titled \"Cold Open\" in which the writing of such a sketch is a plot element.) Non-sketch entertainment programming often also uses a comedy sketch as a Cold Open.\nThe teaser has been used by many series since the 1950s. Today, nearly every American show has a teaser (to get viewers hooked before they can consider changing channels). Many British shows still don't use the technique (what's more, until the 1980s The BBC would actually re-edit most American shows to put the teaser after the opening titles), but it is increasing in prominence.\nWhen US shows are broadcast on British commercial channels the first commercial break is not usually placed after the opening title but about 8-12 minutes in. However, some more recent series like Lost have such long teasers that the commercial does immediately follow the title (or, more rarely, actually precedes it).\nAlthough the term is usually reserved for television, the practice is now prevalent in comic books, having crept into the medium in the mid-80s and grown popular through the 90s. While older comics tend to have the title and credits on the first page, most modern comics now wait until three-to-five pages in, for a suitably dramatic moment. Some comics vary this by introducing the title at the end of this issue (eg. \"Shoot\", a lost issue of Hellblazer) or sometimes square in the middle.\nSubtropes:\nIf the teaser depicts events that come at the end of the show, it can set up a How We Got Here or Once More, with Clarity!. Not to be confused with The Tease. Contrast The Stinger, which is shown after the show, not before it.\n"}
{"EpicBattleBoredom": "When the task is \"kicking ass,\" some really go above and beyond. Sure, our protagonist may have just infiltrated the enemy base and killed six armed guards with his bare hands, but the fact remains that the enemy stronghold still contains at least a hundred other Mooks who are still alive and breathing, and that just won't do. As he's breaking necks without breaking a sweat, the constant stream of new foes is just barely enough to keep him from getting bored. He's suffering from Epic Battle Boredom.\nHe might be reading their name tags, or stealing them, or checking his watch in the middle of a fight\u2014the point is, he's bored. Hopefully the viewer isn't.\nThis happens frequently when the character is a One-Man Army, or just a plain old regular badass. Sometimes involves Excuse Me While I Multitask. The person may think Victory Is Boring, and may tend to do Blas\u00e9 Boast. Compare Strolling Through the Chaos, where they (often) aren't even thinking of battling, merely walking through, while ignoring anything around him.\n"}
{"MasterofIllusion": "Most villains (and the occasional hero, but this is largely a villain power), if given the chance, will employ magic or mechanisms to confuse his or her enemies and render them vulnerable, but a Master of Illusion will go beyond merely using such trickery as a tool. Instead, he or she will hone it into a fine art form; milking it for as much trickery, espionage, and/or personal pleasure as they can derive from it.\nSuch powers are usually psychic in origin, although they can also be technological as well, creating Holograms which can be especially dangerous when they can make them solid (holograms also carry the bonus of being able to fool electronic surveillance). Despite lacking obvious means of attack like with Pyrokinesis and Telekinesis, they can use a Faux Flame to burn, though resolute heroes may resist, or making a gaping hole seem like an even floor. A common variant is for the Master of Illusion to trap the hero in a virtual reality simulation over which the villain has complete control. Of course, death or injury in the simulation will usually mean death or injury in real life, so any hero thus ensnared will have to be careful. Most Masters of Illusion aren't content to just let their VR deathtrap program play out by itself - what would be the fun in that after all? So they'll frequently appear in the simulation, usually as a cackling, monstrous tormentor who plays cat and mouse games with the hero and who mocks their every step. If the Master of Illusion traps a hero in a Lotus-Eater Machine,\u2014or in a simulation of their ordinary, everyday life\u2014they'll frequently appear as an ally of the hero, using this form to distract the hero from discovering their true whereabouts, or as part of a ruse to trick the hero into revealing some important confidential information.\nIn more insidious cases, the Master of Illusion will appear to the hero as a romantic interest, either one the hero knows, or one that's been created whole cloth out of the hero's own memories and desires. This gives the Master of Illusion the chance to screw with the hero's mind (and body, depending on how far the writers let things go.)\nMasters of Illusion really needn't bother with such elaborate setups. It would be easy enough, after all, to trick an enemy into killing himself: use some variant of the \"This Is Not a Floor\" trick; destroy a spaceship by having its crewmembers press the wrong buttons and steer it into the nearest star; kill the heroes by having them confuse each other for enemies and fatally attack each other.. But again, what would be the fun in doing something as simple as that? Masters of Illusion, having Trickster personalities by the very nature of their powers, will usually not be able to resist playing with their prey. Of course, this could\u2014and usually does - give the heroes the time and/or chance to think up a way to counter the Master of Illusion's powers, or leave clues that they are in an illusion in the first place, such as a Blank Book. Once the villain is destroyed, the world they create usually dissolves into nothingness - provided the defeat or death of the Master of Illusion wasn't part of the illusion itself...\nAnd really, as a hero... how would you know? Could you ever really be sure that you defeated the Master of Illusion and escaped? Why is Schr\u00f6dinger's Butterfly flapping nearby?\n(Cue an echoing \"Mwahahahahaha.\")\nInterestingly, the Master of Illusion will very rarely turn out to be the Big Bad - this is because they're far less interested in ruling people than they are in just screwing with them. For some reason, the Big Bad who employs a Master of Illusion never worries that he himself might be enthralled or under their control. (Although if he were, would the Master of Illusion allow him to experience any doubts?) Also, while the Master of Illusion is usually villainous, heroic examples are hardly unknown. If the Master of Illusion is the Big Bad, their power over illusions may become borderline Reality Warping.\nNote: This trope doesn't apply to villains who occasionally employ illusory tricks to ensnare enemies. The Master of Illusion is a specialist in generating manipulative hallucinations, and will usually possess no other powers apart from that. (Although when you have the ability to trick the Mighty Glacier into thinking that his 6-foot long claymore is a flyswatter and that a poisonous mosquito has just landed on the back of his buddy's neck, who needs other powers?)\nSee also Lotus-Eater Machine, Masquerade, The Treachery of Images, I Know What You Fear, Cold Flames and Shapeshifting Seducer. Compare Glamour. Not to be confused with Mickey Mouse's games, or the thirteenth Pok\u00e9mon movie, even if the main Pok\u00e9mon is herself an example of this trope.\nFor the other type of Master of Illusions, the folks who perform to entertain audiences, see Stage Magician.\n"}
{"ToCatchHeroesHireVillains": "A dramatic convention that allows The Hero to face off against a Villain, while being hunted as a criminal. Wait, what?\nThis trope is sometimes used during an In Medias Res opening, giving us the twist of surprise that the hero is suspected, or even completely guilty, of breaking the law, or their moral code. It allows the story to continue with the conflict the heroes have with the people they're trying to defeat, even while the cops are now chasing our hero as well.\nOur hero is now on the side of criminals and ne'er-do-wells, but since he is still a hero even if a law-breaking one, there's a way to neatly avoid the issue of attacking police officers, who are only doing their job. Someone in a position of authority goes Recruiting the Criminal from one of the defeated villains. Now their job is to catch the same person they've lost to before. Often rejoicing in being tasked to take out their enemy and cause as much collateral damage as they wish, one of the cops (or even the person who hired them) will question if crossing the Godzilla Threshold was the right thing to do. Since the hero is unlikely to even be suspected of doing something as dangerous and life-threatening as the villain who hunts him, the usual answer is no.\nThe chances, by the way, of the whole thing being a huge frame-up designed to make the heroes look bad are reasonably high. As are the chances of the person in a position of authority of being a villain himself, who was just looking for an excuse to destroy the hero.\n"}
{"ShockwaveClap": "Clapping is pretty loud, but it pales in comparison to the Shockwave Clap. Sometimes it's just a really loud clap and sometimes it has the power to knock people over or cause physical damage. It can have more intuitive uses from time to time, such as blowing out fires.\nThis is commonly used by characters with Super Strength, since it lets them demonstrate their power without directly attacking someone (which could have messy results). Usually appears in the form of a powerful, high-pressure wave of air.\nThe \"realistic\" varieties of Sword Beam create a similar effect, but concentrated into a sharp edge. However, these are usually associated with skill rather than strength.\nSee also Kung-Fu Sonic Boom, Make Me Wanna Shout, Shockwave Stomp. Not to be confused with Clap Your Hands If You Believe.\n"}
{"ThanksgivingEpisode": "A Thanksgiving Episode is a story or an episode within a larger series that focuses on the holiday of Thanksgiving, celebrated in the United States on the fourth Thursday of November. Canada also has a Thanksgiving holiday, held on the second Monday in October; it also exists on other dates in other countries.\nThanksgiving stories fall into two basic categories. The first category consist of stories that relate to the origin of the holiday. Traditionally, the holiday is dated back to a feast given in 1621 by Pilgrims of the Plymouth colony in Massachusetts to offer thanks to God for their survival past the first harsh year of the settlement. They invited the local Wampanoag tribe, who had been key to that survival, to share the feast with them \u2014 whence the traditional Thanksgiving iconography of steeple-crowned and bonneted Pilgrims alongside buckskin-clad Native Americans. Optimistic portrayals focus on the event as a time of inter-cultural cooperation and celebration . More cynical portrayals will place more emphasis on the long-term negative effect of colonization in displacing the Native Americans.\nThe second category is stories that revolve around the celebration of the holiday in latter years. As with Christmas, Thanksgiving stories tend to be very family oriented, with characters either going to visit relatives or hosting large gatherings of the extended family. Such gatherings are generally intended to be joyous times of celebration, but can also be times of tension and internal family conflict. Often groups will take time to help those less fortunate than themselves.\nThe major focus of the holiday on the Thanksgiving meal, which traditionally includes turkey, potatoes, pies, cranberry sauce, yams, and various vegetables. Preparing the turkey is a big deal, and an inexperienced cook seeking to prove him/herself by cooking a perfect meal will often find themselves making various amusing blunders. Even experienced cooks will find themselves challenged by the expectations placed upon them. Health minded cooks may try to create healthier alternatives to the traditional fare, which will almost certainly not be well received.\nOther activities include the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, watching marathons of TV shows, and watching or even playing American football. If the main character is a cartoonist, they might have the honor of their character being a balloon in the Macy's parade.\nThanksgiving stories will often muse on the true meaning of the holiday \u2014 family, thankfulness, thankfulness for family, etc. \u2014 by having characters enjoying each other's company despite stress, interpersonal conflicts, or inedible turkeys. Particularly likely to be the setting of Dinner and a Show.\nSee also Christmas Episode, Halloween Episode and Valentine's Day Episode.\n"}
{"OnlyICanMakeItGo": "Sometimes the owner or driver of a vehicle has a certain connection to their vehicle (be it a car or spaceship etc.) and a way to demonstrate that bond is to make the operator the only individual who can make it run. In the hands of someone else it will fail to start or come to a stop after a few seconds without the gentle touch of the person who knows the special trick to starting the engine or all the little adjustments you have to make.\nIt tends to happen with either the very best or very worst of cars. The Alleged Car is so rotten through that it needs someone with great knowledge of all its faults to keep it going (and sometimes overlaps with Percussive Maintenance when only the owner knows the sweet spot). The Ace Custom Cool Car can also be full of complex gadgets that you need to keep track of. Or maybe it's just so cool it only deserves the really attentive owner.\nBecause horses are just another kind of vehicle, a Moody Mount may respond this way to a Fluffy Tamer (compare Only the Chosen May Ride).\nWhen The Hero has a car which stands out for its dated design, it is the Hero's Classic Car.\nRelated are Empathic Weapon and Loyal Phlebotinum, which typically will only work for the owner. (Though it is not unknown for a character using this trope to talk as if that trope was in play \u2014 the difference is that those tropes are for devices that refuse to work for anyone else while this one is for devices that malfunction without the owner's special touch.) A Black Box is when the \"I\" in the equation is not present, and the people involved try to bulldoze their way into forcing the something to run, with unpredictable results. Magic Powered Pseudo Science is when the maker is the wizard who did it.\n"}
{"SingleGenderRace": "Not a tribe, but an entire race or group of humanoids inexplicably made up of one sex. Male is usually the default, but females under the Cute Monster Girl rules are becoming more common and more obvious. The lack of the other sex is Hand Waved briefly (or left unexplained altogether); Disaster wiping out the other half, or voluntary separation are two common reasons, although sometimes it seems they just don't appear.\nIf the genetic stock is replenished by mingling with other 'races', you often get the strange explanation that Gender Equals Breed, rather than the offspring being actual hybrids; alternately you can get Bizarre Sexual Dimorphism where two One Gender Races are revealed to be the male and female versions of the same species.\nThis is really more about creating a unique culture without having to create an enormous amount of back story. For obvious reasons this used to be an easy device to soapbox gender issues, with all the associated political and social biases in place. Sufficiently old mythological legends may be grandfathered in even in a series avoiding One Gender Races, because the alternative gender is rarely depicted or has no instantly recognizable version.\nTends to be on the High Fantasy of fantastical scale for reasons obvious to anyone with any concept of biology (with the exception of species that are actually Hermaphrodites, clones, or something more bizarre). Assuming sex is genetically determined in the usual way, sex ratios in animals tend to even out over time, even though sexual selection would suggest only a handful of males (traditionally the \"unlimited\", low-investment sex, at least among mammals \u2014 birds, for example, are often a totally different story) are actually needed or preferred for a population. Within a population or an explicitly social group, however, sex may or may not play much of a role. For example, the concept of mammals (such as lions and certain species of seal) who have \"harems\" has been commonly reinterpreted as females tolerating a single male simply due to access to resources his leadership provides, while having more than one is simply bothersome to the group after a certain age. However, this doesn't mean fewer males contribute to the species; many live on their own or in bachelor groups, taking what they can get. Think The Lion King: Mufasa led the pride, while his brother Scar lived as an outcast.\nIn real life, there do exist all-female fish and whiptail lizard species.\nIn the right (or wrong) subculture, expect Fanon concerning hermaphroditism and various methods of Homosexual Reproduction, especially if the race is all-female.\nSubtrope of Bizarre Alien Sexes.

{"DestinedBystander": "Spoiler Warning!\nDo not actively try to become a Sidekick or True Love. If you really have what it takes, you'll wind up with the role no matter what you do. Sometimes, you will be drawn into some new role or destiny by default, be it hero or villain.\nSuperhero comics tend to run a long time, with large amounts of characters that range from the major to the minor. Thus, there is never a shortage of characters that can dynamically drive the plot, and there's always people who the hero is close to or knows that can become... something else. Sometimes, the guy who was the hero's former roommate, or an old teacher, or a neighbor, can, through what seems like destiny, become intwined into some new role, be it antagonist, love interest, mentor, or otherwise.\nThis is when a character who first appears as a supporting character eventually turns into something more through Character Development, a Legacy Character. The best friend becomes the Big Bad, the old neighbor becomes the Love Interest, etc. The person who was once on the sidelines is inevitably drawn into the main event. They have a definite place in the future of the story.\nIf the character was always intended to be important, that's a Chekhov's Gunman. If the character was hiding their identity during their first appearance, you have a Red Herring Shirt. If a character in an adaptation is introduced earlier than in the source work, that's an Early-Bird Cameo.\n"}
{"InterContinuityCrossover": "A crossover between two works that are not within the same Canon or Continuity.\nHaving a Crossover between two related shows is one thing \u2014 it's not inconceivable that some of the Cheers cast should turn up in Frasier, is it? Or that characters from JAG could turn up on NCIS. Or that the CSI team might help out the guys in CSI: NY every now and again.\nWhat happens when Jay and Silent Bob turn up in Scream 3? Or Cliff and Norm from Cheers book into St. Elsewhere for medical attention? Or a police officer from the grittily realistic Homicide: Life on the Street arrests Fox Mulder of The X-Files? Or the CSI team finds a corpse in a hotel that isn't a corpse, just Angel? Well, then you've got yourself a different kettle of fish altogether. And to add insult to injury, the fish are probably from Finding Nemo and The Little Mermaid.\nThere are a few reasons why this happens. Sometimes it's because both series are owned by the same network or company, and it wants to improve the ratings on the one show by having the cast from the more popular show appear in it. Sometimes it's because both shows share writers or producers and they think it would be amusing to link the two. And sometimes it's just because someone somewhere thought it would be cool.\nMost crossovers of this kind are between properties that are owned by the same company or person, which makes legal wrangling easier. But sometimes characters will cross over into another company's properties, like the occasional events from rival comic book firms DC Comics and Marvel Comics.\nIt makes quite a difference whether the crossover reveals that the characters have supposedly been sharing the same world the whole time; or if they're \"just\" from Another Dimension. While not as big a deal if both series are \"relatively\" realistic, such as Crime Dramas, if each show has its own version of fantastic events a la Fantasy or Science Fiction; then the implication is that these elements have been existing side by side the whole time, unaware of each other. It also makes for some great Fridge Logic. \"Hey, Problem A for Cast B is no big deal, if Cast A and B are friends, why don't they just ask for help?\" Of course, Superman Stays Out of Gotham, and Reed Richards Is Useless as always.\nFor more information and examples, see Thom Holbrook's Crossovers and Spin Offs Master List, which documents all known crossovers between TV series, except for cartoons. With this information, the site has been able to identify no fewer than 38 contiguous TV \"universes\" (as of March 2008) which are home to widely disparate (and apparently unlikely) combinations of series from different eras and networks. For instance, see Holbrook's \"Group 2\" \u2014 ninety-four series (as of March 2012) ranging from Six Feet Under and Everybody Loves Raymond to Law & Order and The X-Files, taking in M*A*S*H, Cop Rock, and Home Improvement along the way. Thanks to the baroque web of interconnections and crossovers, it is suggested that these shows all inhabit the same universe. (Holbrook also discovered the \"Jean-Claude Van Damme is dead\" plague that poses a grave threat to any future crossovers including Star Trek and other Group 10 shows.)\nIt has been noted on this and other sites that the web of crossovers connects many shows, directly or indirectly, to St. Elsewhere. Since that entire series was shown in its final episode to be the fantasy of an autistic mental patient, it has become a Stock Epileptic Tree that all of reality is All Just a Dream of an autistic mental patient. In the words of Dwayne McDuffie, one of the executive producers of Justice League, \"The last five minutes of St. Elsewhere is the only television show, ever. Everything else is a daydream.\"\nFor the webcomic equivalent of the TV crossover list, see the Webcomic Crossover & Cameo Archive.\nSome fanfics specialise in lobbing together lots of fandoms together in one big Mega Crossover. (And speaking of fanfics, if you're not sure if a crossover exists for a given pair of fandoms, remember that Rule 50 is in effect - it probably exists somewhere.)\nWhen this trope happens with three or more series instead of two, it's a Massive Multiplayer Crossover. When the two settings are blended so as to be one unified setting that partakes of elements from both, that's a Fusion Fic.\nWhen each others' works of fiction appear in-universe as fiction in a stable fictional loop, that's Mutually Fictional. When a work of fiction itself appears in its own story, that's Recursive Canon.\nCompare Crossover, Fake Crossover, Weird Crossover.

{"GrowingWings": "Since the dawn of time man has wanted to fly. But, well... To be honest it is pretty darn hard. It took a long time to figure out that humans themselves could not fly and it took even longer before man could do it with tools. But what if if could be done easier? What if humans could simply grow wings themselves and fly away?\nGrowing Wings is a trope centered around a person, animal, or even an object that sprouts wings. The wings either grow over time, or are gained instantly. The wings can appear suddenly, often as a result of a magical spell or MacGuffin.\nIn case of a person or animal, the character could also go through Metamorphosis. They can wake up one morning to discover tiny wings on their back, which grow over time until they are functional. The initial sprouts can be ridges, feathery tufts, or tiny, articulated wings. The more realistic the story is, the more slow and painful the change will be. If the transformation and large flight muscles also develop, it can be a case of Transformation Horror.\nNote that this trope is for permanent or semi-permanent wings. Wings that appear and disappear go into the category of Power Gives You Wings.\n"}
{"NonPromotion": "Great news, Page! I'm giving you a Promotion! Your new title is Trope Page, as opposed to your old role of Blank Page. Now the pay's the same and there are no perks, but you will be expected to keep discussions, indexes, and a good example list. It's a new responsibility. Keep at it and you may get moved up later, but for now you need to put in the extra time, this is great opportunity for you!\nThere are a great many names for this: in Real Life and in fictional office settings they call it being a Team Leader. In the military they call it a Brevet or acting rank, you get the authority and whatnot of the promotion, but not the money. Happened a lot in Real Life in the American Civil War and the World Wars and still happens to this day to an extent if a unit is short on personnel.\nThink of it as the opposite of being Kicked Upstairs, you stay right where you are but do more work! Oh and I need you to file these examples too.\n"}
{"AnimateBodyParts": "Some works, especially commercials, feature parts of the human body with their own separate personalities and desires. The body part in question usually has something to do with the product being sold, and may or may not be connected to a full human body.\nSee also Giant Hands of Doom.\n"}
{"ShyFingerTwiddling": "When embarrassed or reluctant, ditzy or shy characters frequently touch their forefingers' tips together in front of them and twiddle them up and down, often accompanied by a \"toiktoik\" sound, and some tiptoe twiddling to boost. It's also done by shy characters when speaking to the object of their affection.\nWhile this trope is most prominent in anime and manga-influenced works, it's occasionally found in western works with an anime-inspired esthetics.\nOften seen in anime in a Cannot Spit It Out or \"please don't embarrass me\" situation. Not to be confused with Finger-Tenting. In Real Life, psychologists and readers of body language would call this displacement activity.\n"}
{"AwesomeUnderwaterWorld": "To the average person, most people would not consider much what was going underwater, despite it making up 70% of the world. Given how humanity cannot survive underwater without special equipment only developed recently, it does make a fair bit of sense.\nYet, when people were finally able to go underwater, they discovered how breath-taking it all isnote\u00a0and not just because you can't breathe there.\nThanks to the endless potential of fiction along with the growing advancements in technology and science for underwater exploration, many creators have been awed at the abundance of life and mystery held beneath the waves. Beyond the strange and exotic-looking creatures is the fact that it remains unexplored, maintaining this sense of mystery under the waves.\nThen there is the centuries of lore and mythology associated with the ocean since humanity first set out to sea. Besides the classic romance of sailors and explorers with the sea, humanity has always maintained fascination with what magical or monstrous beings lived underwater, a new world where humanity could not tread. This has been reflected in various folktales and stories in all sorts of human mythologies. Combine this with the potential discovery for ruins of ancient or modern human creations and you have an underwater world of awe. Awe-derwater if you will.\nProbably contains an Underwater City (usually Atlantis) inhabited by mermaids, Apparently Human Merfolk and or Fish People. For wildlife, you will find Sea Monsters, fish and dolphins, both playful and heroic.\nFor related underwater tropes, see: Water Is Air, This Looks Like a Job for Aquaman, Flying Seafood Special, Under the Sea. Subtrope of Scenery Porn. Contrast Atlantis Is Boring.\n"}
{"HomefieldAdvantage": "In a Real Life Sporting Event, a Home Team or Home Field Advantage refers to the slight edge given to a team playing on their own turf in a match. This exists because of the subtle differences between various sporting venues and the home team already being accustomed to their own court or field or rink, and also because the crowd at a game will usually overwhelmingly support the home team, thus presenting a psychological advantage. While it can give a slight boost to the home team or bring the away team down by a small margin, usually this is not enough to make much of a difference in the game's outcome.\nBut, in fiction, something so mundane would be boring or require some over the top effects to work like they want. So what do you do? It can be as simple as taking the above mentioned subtle differences and making them such large alterations that it throws the away team off completely. Perhaps the psychological advantage is huge, rather than small. Perhaps the game awards points based on popularity. Perhaps the game and field are complex enough that every field is unique (like golf) and/or deadly (not like golf).\nYou could set the playing field itself against them (again, like golf, only it's alive and maybe trying to kill you). All that matters is that whoever is battling on their own turf has a serious advantage that poses a legitimate threat to the other side's winning chances. Often involves Geo Effects, taking advantage of the terrain.\nOf course, this isn't just about sports. If the bad guys attack the hero in his home, he's bound to have a few tricks up his sleeve. Even if he doesn't have anything prepared, who knows his home better than he does? Perhaps you're a local hero and everyone supports you, actively or clandestinely, in your fight against the rampaging killbots. Perhaps you're a Physical God, and your home is literally part of you. Perhaps you can even change the local laws of physics to confound attackers. The possibilities are endless.\n"}
{"PlayerGuidedMissile": "Ever watch a Homing Projectile suffer yet another Hero-Tracking Failure and think to yourself, \"hell, I could fly a missile better than that\"? Now you can!\nThe Player-Guided Missile is any Video Game projectile attack or weapon which the player can manually steer or guide toward their desired target using their player movement controls. These can be more dangerous than ordinary homing missiles (at least in the hands of a skilled player), although they do mean that while the player is busy piloting the missile, their character is left open and vulnerable to attack.\nThe projectile can take many forms - an actual homing missile or Precision-Guided Boomerang, for example - and 3D games frequently utilize a Missile Cam so the player can steer the projectile from its own point of view. Which also makes it usable not just for combat, but also for general scouting, recon, and solving various puzzles (typically by activating an otherwise inaccessible switch or control panel).\nThis is Truth in Television, as manual command to line-of-sight systems to guide rockets or missiles exist. These homing methods rely on the operator to steer the missile's flight path via joystick; the commands from the joystick is relayed to the missile via various methods, most popularly via wire guidance. That being said, they are nowhere near as precisely maneuverable as their Video Game counterparts, mostly because they are extremely fast, and require extensive regular training to operate. For this reason, semi-automatic command to line-of-sight systems are more popular and reliable. The operator firing the missile does not need to actually adjust the missile manually; merely aiming continuously at the target is enough.\nNote that an example only counts if the player has more or less direct control of the projectile's flight path \u2014 simply \"aiming\" or \"locking on\" to a target before firing isn't enough. Also note that these only count when wielded by a live human player, as there's no way to distinguish it from a normal homing missile if it's fired from the hands of an AI-controlled character.\n"}
{"StillSucksThumb": "Thumb-sucking is an Oral Fixation associated with babies. Normally, most children grow out of the habit. Some older children and adults however keep doing it, much to the embarrassment of others. In comedy this will be Played for Laughs to indicate that this person is a Manchild who never grew up. In drama this trope is used more to indicate a person's insecurity and/or to present him as cute and pitiful.\nThumbsucking with adults is Truth in Television too, as some people still can't shake the habit off as they grow older, usually as a result of some trauma or feelings of stress, anxiety and/or insecurity.\nCan sometimes be combined with Troubled Fetal Position. Contrast Finger-Suck Healing.\n"}
{"SuperhumanTrafficking": "In a setting where there are Witch Species, aliens, fairies, or superpowers that show up with sufficient regularity, these Differently Powered Individuals will have the hardship of being hunted by those who want to exploit them for money, power and... other uses. The government, corporations, Mad Scientists and criminal organizations may seek to enslave and co-opt them to evil ends, such as spying, Super Soldiering, For Science!, and many other purposes.\nIn extreme cases they may become a Slave Race or Endangered Species thanks to this Fantastic Racism. The protagonists are likely a part of this oppressed group, and have to spend the story on the run from their oppressors, trying to escape their captors control, and/or thwarting their plans and helping their fellows escape. As a result of this trope, members of this oppressed group are likely to choose Transhuman Treachery and the enslavement (or eradication) of mankind, which can be poetically tragic if the fear of this is what lead to the enslavement in the first place.\nSee also Mutant Draft Board and Super Registration Act. For examples of what things can be like if Supers volunteer their abilities, check out These Look Like Jobs for the Superman.\n"}
{"UselessUsefulSpell": "A staple of RPGs, your characters can learn attacks or skills such as Instant Death, Poison, Confusion, Paralyze, Silence, and Petrify, or Percent Damage Attacks that at first glance seem incredibly useful. However, in reality these spells are usually anything but useful, for any, and often several, of the following reasons:\nOf course, when any enemy possesses such spells, they will invariably be effective when used on you, unless you happen to be wearing a type of armor that protects against such attacks or status effects. Even if the computer plays fair, a spell may still end up this way. The expendable hordes of enemy NPCs don't need to worry about exposing themselves to danger or wasting resources if the spell fails, and they only need the spell to work once to give the player a Game Over. In many cases, this explains the presence of the spell; it's not so useful in the player's hands, but when the enemy uses it against the party, it's a significant threat.\nMost character classes made up of buff / debuff effects like this tend to be much less popular than others for these reasons. However, it's averted with relative frequency; many games do allow for some very effective use of traditionally \"Useless\" spells. One trick is to pair up the effect with a normal attack, meaning that if the spell misses, the player still deals damage. Other games, especially the more strategic ones, make these spells useful by having Elite Mooks who are genuinely dangerous in battle but without such immunities, or simply by having base Mooks be more credible opponents.\nThese attacks are also far more useful in MMORPGs due to generally stronger Mooks and player-controlled enemies that are very vulnerable to such tactics. Useless Useful Spells are often hated among MMORPG communities for their ability to handicap player characters (often even better than when used on Mooks due to the computer cheating). However, in PvP, that is a different story!\nJudging by the way this has been going away in recent years and is less and less accepted, it seems to be on its way to becoming a Discredited Trope. May however be an Acceptable Break from Reality regarding some; because it would not make a boss (especially the Final Boss) very challenging to be able to just hit \"Instant Death\".\nSubtrope of Underused Game Mechanic. Super Trope to Contractual Boss Immunity. Compare Awesome, but Impractical (You will find use for an Awesome But Impractical ability, albeit not on a regular basis; You won't find a good reason to use Useless Useful Spells at all). Contrast with the Inverse Law of Utility and Lethality, where the more powerful something is in combat, the less it is outside of it.\nWhen an otherwise Useless Useful Spell is redeemed by being useful against a specific boss or in a particular situation, it is Not Completely Useless.\n"}
{"MadeOfPhlebotinum": "Some settings have Phlebotinum. It helps move along the plot, Hand Wave various characters' improbable powers, and conveniently get the Heroes from point A to point B quickly. It can let you just say A Wizard Did It.\nBut then some settings...are different. They have nothing but Phlebotinum. That City of Adventure the heroes are exploring around? It's completely floating in the air; not one building is touching the ground. Why? Phlebotinum! In fact, the whole planet is probably bound together with some sort of magical or super-science energy, without which it would simply explode. Every single thing around requires whatever the local flavor of Phlebotinum is to run in worlds such as these, whether it's magic, nanomachines, The Force, or something else similar.\nThe main dividing line between a world that simply has a lot of Phlebotinum and one that's made of the stuff is this litmus test: if you took away the Phlebotinum, would your world still exist in any meaningful sense, or would it more or less just collapse? If it would, your world is just plain Made Of Phlebotinum.\nThere is actually a great deal of evidence that Real Life is thus: when you develop a potent capability to the point that there are few side effects, you start using it for everything imaginable. When we learned to harness electricity easily, the only things weren't 100% electrical were the things that we used to generate electricity. When computers became advanced enough, we started carrying them around with us. Litmus Test? If you took away computers, it'd re-create The Great Depression. If you took away electricity, ninety percent of the world would die within a decade.\nIf something is literally made of Phlebotinum, see Made of Magic.\n"}
{"KaiserReich": "When Germany isn't shown as Oktoberfest, or All Germans Are Nazis, chances are it would be shown like this, particularly in historical works. The Theme Park Version of Imperial Germany (and Prussia in particular) during the late 19th century and World War I, these Germans are likely to be dour, industrious types with a love of war, honour and tradition and a hatred of fun and games. Given that this version of Germany has definite Proud Warrior Race undertones, characters from the Kaiserreich will most likely be Arrogant aristocrats spouting Gratuitous Germannote\u00a0Or something that sounds like it. Or something that some people think sounds like it. and wearing Badass Longcoats, dueling scars and monocles optional. What isn't optional, on the other hand, is the Pickelhaube, the classic World War I-era German army helmet topped by a nasty-looking steel spike.\nKeeping in line with the late-19th century/World War I era atmosphere, great big black eagles and Iron Crosses will most likely be everywhere, while the Kaiserreich's military will usually consist of vaguely WWI-ish technology, especially ugly box-shaped tanks (which all have individual names), U-Boats, Gas Mask Mooks, and, of course, zeppelins. Bonus points if there is some amount of confusion as to whether this is the Kaiserreich or the Those Wacky Nazis (especially if No Swastikas is in effect).\nNot to be confused with Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg, a Hearts of Iron II mod where the Kaiserreich wins World War I.\n"}
{"MadeOfTemptation": "Sometimes it's The Final Temptation, or sometimes the Big Bad is just trying to sucker The Hero out of his soul/girlfriend/superpowers. So he tempts the hero: not with a long and happy life, not with power, wisdom or practical wealth, but with a sparkling, gem-encrusted tool of his trade. The trick is that, while shiny, the object is of no practical value; its sole purpose is to look appetizing to the temptee.\nOften, the temptuous object is placed alongside a similar but less sparkly object, and the hero is forced to choose between them; in such a case, he is expected to realize that the object in question is basically worthless, or worse; an Artifact of Death.\nCompare Artifact of Doom (which is crafted not from Temptation but from pure evil), MacGuffin (which can be crafted from anything; we don't care), and Deal with the Devil. If something is actually made of temptation, see Insubstantial Ingredients. See also The Final Temptation. If the temptuousness has broad appeal (and this appeal is regardless of blinged-out-ness) then it's probably an Artifact of Attraction.\n"}
{"Alicorn": "A winged unicorn is a unicorn with wings. The idea would be to combine all the mobility of a flying creature with grace and rarity of a unicornnote\u00a0and occasionally magical ability. Also known as an pegacorn, unipeg, or cerapter,note\u00a0 keros (horn) + pteros (wing) but the most familiar term to use for this species is ''Alicorn'', which is a combination of the French words for wing (''aile'') and horn (''corne'').note\u00a0Note that in French, the word for unicorn is also licorne. However, be careful with this usage because the word alicorn also refers to the horn of a unicorn itself.\nWhen winged unicorns appear alongside regular pegasi (pterippi is the general name for winged horses) and unicorns, it often indicates a (benevolent) hierarchy where they're usually top of the pecking order. In fantasy universes featuring humans, winged unicorns often serve as the Cool Horse, and will indicate that their rider is super-special.\nGenerally, they are rare \u2014 too many of these critters running around your fantasy world might make a work seem juvenile, since it's a melding of two magical creatures little girls generally adore. It's more likely to be a one-off creature with an unusual background (a \"freak\" unicorn or pegasus, a mysterious race in itself, or the result of powerful magic). It's surprisingly uncommon for them to be the actual hybrid offspring of a unicorn and a pegasus.\nA Sub-Trope of both Unicorn and Pegasus, and also Hybrid Monster.\nHowever, to most Asian cultures, there is no difference between a winged unicorn and a regular unicorn.note\u00a0Also, pegasi do not exist in those cultures. Depending on the culture specifics, normal unicorns either don't exist in their folklore and all unicorns have wings, or the unicorns of their culture can magically make their set of wings appear and disappear at will, and are usually portrayed as Sapient Steeds.\nOther Examples\n"}
{"GoingCosmic": "Going Cosmic is when a work of fiction that was ostensibly about something else starts delving into deep theological and philosophical issues. Frequently for Western works, this entails the introduction of a monotheistic deity with a strong resemblance to the Judeo-Christian God.\nIn some cases, the work may have really been about something else to start with, but the writers ran out of ideas and so decided to explore the meaning of Life, the Universe, and Everything. This type of Going Cosmic is usually fairly sudden and/or the result of a Retool. The other form of Going Cosmic is when the Cosmic ideas which were always in the background start shoving their way to the foreground and overshadowing everything else. This tends to be a more gradual process.\nUsually indicates a Writer on Board. Expect a lot of Rule of Symbolism and Contemplate Our Navels. Often results in Jumping the Shark. Sometimes a symptom of Cerebus Syndrome. Compare Big Damn Movie, where a film adaptation of a mundane series is given an epic storyline. Compare Cosmic Horror Reveal, What Do You Mean, It's Not Didactic?\nDoesn't have to do with SpaceX or having gone to plaid, or other tropes that actually deal with space.\n"}
{"RedisHeroic": "Red shows up a lot when it comes to the heroes of a story, usually the color of their clothing. As their main color motif, it could also be their hair color, gear, Battle Aura, or body parts for robots and non-human characters. This could be limited to the main protagonist, or be as wide as an entire Badass Army. Some Chromatic Arrangement trios have the leader wear red.\nThe reason is that red is the color of fire and blood, hence the color of action. Thus it conveys that the heroes are people of action as well (regardless of exactly how the heroism is presented in the show).\nIn Japan this was traditional in old Kabuki plays and the like. It's made to represent the hero bathed in the blood of his enemies. It is much less common in America due to the association with red as the color of the country's enemies (redcoat British in the Revolutionary War, Red Scares and the Cold War in the 20th century), but gets a pass if it's paired with white and/or blue.\nKeep in mind that since not all heroes wear red (for example, Blue is also very common), and other characters don't avoid that color, there isn't much point in listing aversions to this.\nA Super Trope to Primary-Color Champion and Pink Heroine. A Sub-Trope of Good Colors, Evil Colors. A Sister Trope to Fire Is Red and Blue Is Heroic.\nCompare Heroes Want Redheads, Bring My Red Jacket, Heroes Prefer Swords, Color-Coded Characters, Purple Is Powerful, Law of Chromatic Superiority, Satan is Good.\nContrast Red and Black and Evil All Over, Red Eyes, Take Warning, Evil Redhead, Big Red Devil, a literal Red Shirt (and Red Shirt Army), Char Clone, Evil Wears Black, Green and Mean.\nCompare AND contrast Red Is Violent, its Evil Counterpart (even when sometimes both tropes overlaps).\n"}
{"MultiVolumeWork": "Any work that runs at more than one volume or installment. Usually, these works tend to be much longer than your average book, but there are exceptions. The work itself can be considered one large story broken into parts or several smaller stories with recurring themes and characters.\nThe reasons for breaking a story up into parts can vary. Some books, like The Lord of the Rings, were considered too long by the publisher, making this an example of Executive Meddling. Other times, this is simply a demand of the medium or genre that the author works in. For example, the novels of Charles Dickens were all serialized in fiction magazines due to the prohibitive cost of book printing. In both of these cases, the stories are considered one large work and are often combined in one volume for sale later. See also: Serial Novel, Divided for Publication.\nOther times, the works are meant to be individual stories that stand on their own. This can be the intention of the author from the start. Other times, such as with an unexpected Cash Cow Franchise, one book that was meant to be self contained becomes outrageously popular, prompting sequels.\nThis is a literature trope and an example of Prose Fiction.\n"}
{"DespairEventhorizon": "The line that, once crossed, destroys any last remaining sense of hope. It could be for a cause, a person, a situation, or simple survival. A character has given up on it, and there is no going back. It can lead soldiers to despair \u2014 or even suicide, if they don't simply lose the will to live. It can turn an Ideal Hero into an Anti-Hero or an outright villain, or even, in some cases, vice versa. It is a vital element of Tragedy.\nComing near this line is quite common in fiction; frequently, at the end of the second act or the 45 minute mark of a drama or the first hour of a film, the protagonist comes dangerously close to the edge before a Rousing Speech or Deus ex Machina or the like comes along. It makes for a Downer Ending if the protagonist does fall over the edge. Frequently, this is when the What You Are in the Dark test hits him. Alternatively, many stories have a hero \"Fighting the Good Fight\" and meeting someone who'd been at it longer and lost all hope.\nThis is often a goal of some wars. Break the enemy's morale, and you can achieve victory even without military success.\nRelated to Heroic BSoD and Heroic Safe Mode, except the hero usually comes back from those. A Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds is often a character who crossed this line long ago. It can result in the character entering an Angst Coma, being Dumb Struck or suffering Death by Despair (and subsequently crossing the Moral Event Horizon or Jumping Off the Slippery Slope). Often a result of We Used to Be Friends or some variants of Personal Horror. This is often the final stage of the Break the Cutie process. In a video game, often happens during a Bleak Level, and it may be relevant if the game has a Morale Mechanic.\nMay be preceded with a Hope Spot, just to really twist the knife. And a Downer Ending might follow in really dark stories.\nOften a factor in Pater Familicide. May be feigned by critics engaged in a Critic Breakdown.\nCompare Safety in Indifference, Hope Is Scary (the reason nobody ever crosses the horizon back again), Hope Crusher (someone who delights seeing characters crossing this horizon, or even worse, pushing other people to cross the horizon).\nContrast Heroic Spirit.\nIMPORTANT: This is about a character losing all hope, not merely getting depressed, upset, or bored.\n"}
{"LogicalFallacy": "Logic. Every story needs some of it, unless you just want a series of unconnected images and no plot to speak of.\nThe problem is that logic requires writers to think pretty hard about what they write, and not all writers have time or inclination to do so. So they take shortcuts, creating fallacies which at best can lead to plot holes or, at worst, undermine the entire story.\nFallacies are common errors in logic. By strict standards, fallacies don't address the truth of the premises or syllogism; they only address the validity of the logic, and as the Sound/Valid/True rule demonstrates, \"truth\" and \"validity\" are not the same thing when speaking of formal logic. There is a reason there are Critical Thinking classes.\nWhere deductive logic is valid, the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. \"If it rains, then the sidewalk will be wet\" is valid, so if you know that it rained, you know that the sidewalk will be wet. If you simply reverse the terms and say \"if the sidewalk is wet, then it rained\" this would not be valid; likewise, negating the terms, yielding \"if it did not rain, then the sidewalk is not wet\", is also invalid. To correct this, you need to construct a \"contra-positive,\" where you reverse the terms as well as negating them to get \"if the sidewalk is not wet, then it did not rain\".\nHowever, inductive logic involves reasonable inferences of what might be true, but not necessarily. A sidewalk could be wet due to a passing street sweeping vehicle or neighbours carelessly watering their lawns. Seeing a wet sidewalk and concluding that there was rain is fallacious\u2014not deductively valid\u2014but it is not necessarily false, nor is it necessarily an unreasonable inference to make.\nLogical fallacies are faulty deductive reasoning. This doesn't mean that they aren't effective at persuading. Many of them are extremely effective tools of persuasion. The key is that there are two primary routes of persuasion: the central (logical) route and the peripheral (emotional) route. To persuade someone using the central route, you need logic; a logical fallacy will make your argument fall flat on its face. To persuade someone using the peripheral route, you don't need logic; you simply need to play on their emotions. Some people are impassive to emotional appeals, and so you must use logic to persuade them; others are confused by logic, and so must be persuaded through emotion.\nHowever, one must keep in mind that\u2014depending on the surrounding circumstances\u2014a deductively fallacious argument may still, nonetheless, be a reasonable and (inductively) logical argument that has decent prospects of being true despite the deductive logic being invalid. A classic example is if someone were to examine a million swans and note that all of them were white. It would be a (deductively) logical fallacy to conclude that \"all swans are white\". You could not make that conclusion unless you know that you had examined all swans in the universe. That doesn't make it illogical, however. If no one had ever seen a black swan, it might be rather sensible. Plus, this whole type of analysis is complicated when you talk about statistical trends. For these kinds of special cases, see Fallacy Fallacy.\nFor examples of characters falling into these fallacies (intentionally on the writer's part), see Insane Troll Logic and Chewbacca Defense. Not to be confused with Logic Bomb.\n"}
{"TriadsAndTongs": "Subject of a thousand Hong Kong Films and a recurrent trope in Western Yellow Peril stories, the Triads started life as a Ming-restorationist Secret Society during the 1760s. There was a precedent for this sort of thing working, given the Red Turban society and rebellion which fractured the Yuan Empire and allowed the Ming to conquer China in the late 14th century, though said society's original intent had actually been to restore the Song Empire.\nAccordingly the Triads were associated with the colour red and the name 'Hong' because it was part of the first Ming Emperor's reign name (Hongwu, lit. 'superlative martial accomplishment') and the name of one of the society's founders. From the beginning they created an official mythology which claimed that had actually been created during the Ming-Qing wars of the 17th century, after the burning of the southern Shaolin temple, by five survivors of the battle. Some even claimed that one of them was Jee Sin, who was the master of the 5 Elders of Southern Chinese kung fu.\nAfter contributing to the fall of the Qing Empire in the 1911 revolution, without resurrecting the Ming (as had been their original intention), the Triads now found themselves without a purpose and there was a split between the Mainland and overseas branches. The Mainland group is what we now commonly refer to as the Triads, while the overseas group became known as the Hongmen. The mainland Triads now turned to crime as they were unable to reenter normal society. After the Communist takeover, many Triad members moved to Hong Kong and Taiwan to escape new measures against organized crime. Hong Kong's Triad problems peaked in the 1970s, helped by police corruption.\nThe Hongmen is divided into 180 branches, and is arguably a Freemason-like organization, with an emphasis on patriotism, given the circumstances of its origin. Distinguished politicians such as Sun Yat Sen and Chiang Kai Shek were senior members. It shares traditions with the Triads, since they were one and the same not that far back. They are illegal in Hong Kong due to their relationship with the Triads, but are legal in Taiwan as a secret society. Not surprising, since President Chiang Kai Shek was a member. They exist in China as a political party, and hold the single non-communist ministerial seat. It has branches in other overseas Chinese communities, where it is referred to as Chinese Freemasonry. Its membership is rapidly aging with the change in the times.\nAnother group are the Tongs (literally \"meeting hall\", each Tong was named after the hall in which they were headquartered), modeled on the Triads, which arose in the US in response to the need for support organizations for new immigrant Chinese, as well as taking charge of protecting their members from violence from other groups. Some Tongs are fully legitimate organizations, providing charity to needy immigrants, giving them jobs and such. Others are more criminal in outlook, engaging in drug smuggling (opium being the most stereotypical one), prostitution, and racketeering. But usually, the average Tong was composed of both criminal and legitimate branches, with the criminal activity funding the charity (and the charity providing cover for the crimes). Many Triad members would join Tongs on reaching America, causing some Tongs to be strongly influenced by the Triads.\nChinese secret societies are guaranteed to exist anywhere in the world with a significant Chinese immigrant population, from Australia to L.A.\nThe secret societies used to be governed by strict codes of conduct and an inflexible hierarchical system, but that system has broken down in recent years, leading to behavior that many older members would consider unethical. The traditional secret societies have 36 Oaths which basically say, \"don't screw over your sworn brothers, or you will get chopped up with lots of blades.\" (This phrase is repeated many, many times during the oaths, just to remind you). Doesn't mention anything about the morality of killing innocents. The oaths are sealed with the drinking of blood mixed with wine, and the oath-takers enter into a sworn brotherhood with the rest of the members of their organization. No problems with having more sworn brothers from elsewhere, though.\nThe traditional hierarchy and rituals, based in esoteric numerology and mythology, are not always followed as strictly or exactly as the old days, but many traditions live on in lingo and ceremony. The leader of a Triad is called the Mountain Master or Dragon Head. Below him are his highest tier: Deputy Mountain Master, who acts as the Dragon Head's advisor and proxy, Incense Master, who oversees ceremonies and initiations, and Vanguard, who handles recruitment and assists the Incense Master. The middle officers are the Red Poles, White Paper Fans and Straw Sandals. Red Poles are the gang bosses and war leaders, commanding their own units to attack enemies, defend turf and engage in street crime. White Paper Fans are the consiglieres and administrators, managing and advising on finances, business and legal matters. Straw Sandals are liaisons, organizing and scheduling important meetings or gang fights. At the bottom are 49ers, who are simply the low-ranking initiates under Red Poles, and Blue Lanterns, the miscellaneous thugs, dealers, and contacts who are informally affiliated with or freelance for the group but not properly initiated into the Triad for life. Blue Lanterns tend to outnumber 49ers in modern times, but obviously are less trusted and more expendable. 25er is slang for a corrupt cop or contact in a rival group, serving as spies and informants.\nAs mentioned earlier, the traditional punishment is death by a hundred cuts, or getting ambushed and hacked up which is easier and quicker. Hong Kong triads especially love their cleavers, given the difficulty of obtaining guns in Hong Kong. A machete is fine too. Overseas groups may use guns, automatic weapons and explosives, if they don't find them dishonorable.\nSome martial arts, especially some of the Southern Shaolin styles tend to have a reputation as being used by the Triads, especially due to their common origin myth in the Southern Shaolin temple.\nThe patron god of the Triads is none other than Guan Yu (of both literary and video game note). He is also the patron god of the police... and a patron god for business. Basically, Guan Yu is the god for any high risk endeavour where you want trustworthy 'brothers' watching your back.\nIt should be noted that 'Chinese Mafia' is both an oversimplification and misconception of Triads and Tongs, as neither have that much presence in China itself. Triads have some influence in certain regions of China, but operate most extensively outside of mainland China, as Mao's regime dismantled traditional secret societies during the Cultural Revolution, and the Tongs are largely a western phenomenon. Within the actual People's Republic of China there are criminal outfits called Black Societies, which wield significant but subtle political power and clout with local law enforcement, and Dark Forces, which are less organized, less powerful gangs (both terms being awkward translations of weird Chinese terms), neither having any relationship to traditional Chinese mysticism. Essentially, Triads are ethnically Chinese criminal societies abroad.note\u00a0Most prominently in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau, with heavy presence in Southeast Asia, though they also have minor footholds in Japan, Korea, Russia, Australia, Europe, Hawaii and, thanks to Chinatowns and the Tongs, continental USA and Canada.\nCompare and contrast with The Syndicate, Yakuza, The Mafia, The Mafiya, London Gangster.\n"}
{"BitchinSheepsClothing": "You meet someone you think is a really Nice Guy/Girl, or perhaps you meet a favorite celebrity for the first time, thinking that they'll be just as warm-hearted and cool as they are on camera. However, something happens to show their true colors, revealing an immature brat, total Jerkass, or even outright villain.\nCongratulations. You've just met the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing \u2014 the polar opposite of Hidden Heart of Gold.\nThe Wounded Gazelle Gambit is a favorite tactic of this sort of antagonist, and if they are genuinely evil, expect them to be a Villain with Good Publicity.\nIt's also worth mentioning that this trope isn't exclusive to female characters. The title is a play on \"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,\" and can apply to any gender. All it requires is a person appears to be nice, but is actually cruel and/or manipulative.\nIn romance plots, the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing is usually trying to date, dating, or about to marry another character, and is hiding their true colors. Occasionally, the Bitch in Sheep's Clothing genuinely was a nice person... but suffered sudden Character Derailment in order to remove their status as a love interest for another character. In any case, expect them to make an Engineered Public Confession in one form or another.\nIn some cases however, a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing can be sympathetic. Many lighter cases involve a scenario in which a fairly flawed yet well intentioned character make themselves out to be more benevolent than they really are (especially if they have a high opinion of themselves). More often than not, this charade falls apart and their true persona blasts out, usually in an extreme manner that makes them look even worse than they usually are. In some cases, a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing can lean more towards Jerk with a Heart of Gold if they aren't too busy hiding their unpleasant qualities with an overenacted facade, instead of showing their genuine (and usually resented) redeeming aspects. Maybe someone will seem like this, then you realize they are just a type B Tsundere.\nSee also: Devil in Plain Sight, Villain with Good Publicity, Warts and All and False Innocence Trick. The Fake Cutie is a subtrope where the (usually young) bitch tries to invoke cuteness or childlike innocence. The Troublemaking New Pet is a related trope where someone takes in a new pet, only to learn that the pet is a huge troublemaker or outright evil and gets rid of it afterward once discovered. A Romantic False Lead is often like this. The Enfant Terrible is also a related trope (possibly the Annoying Younger Sibling with Sibling Rivalry from Hell). For a version specifically concerning actors and actresses, see Nice Character, Mean Actor. For a more extreme version of this trope, see Bait the Dog, where the 'bitch', oddly enough, likes to Kick the Dog.\nNot to be confused either with Affably Evil or Beware the Nice Ones, where the person is genuinely nice rather than just putting up a facade (though both tropes can be derailed as such if overexaggerated, as can a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing evolve into one of the former via Character Development). Overlaps with Faux Affably Evil when the character keeps the polite and friendly attitude while about to do something horrible to someone else even when the other character knows it. Contrast With Took a Level in Jerkass, where the character was genuinely nice and became... well a Jerkass. Also compare and contrast Jerk with a Heart of Jerk. Compare Jerkass to One if they are nice to everyone, but horrible to one particular person.\nContrast Bitch Alert for a bitch who lets everyone knows that she's one. Subtrope of A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing. Contrast also with Sheep in Sheep's Clothing for a character believed to be a Bitch in Sheep's Clothing and eventually subverted.\n"}

{"StrongButUnskilled": "A character who is Unskilled, but Strong lacks the refined technique of formal training, but compensates in various ways through raw power. They may eat anti-tank missiles the way a glutton goes through an all-you-can-eat buffet. They may be so strong they kick tanks around like footballs or have the firepower to crush the US, China and Russia in a conventional conflict. They may make a Bugatti Veyron look slow or waltz through a point-blank crossfire of Gatling guns with ease that makes an Agent envious. They may have won the Superpower Lottery. However it is, they are so very naturally talented they don't need skill. They tend to have the attitude that if brute force doesn't work, it's just because they didn't use enough of it, as well as that they will charge head-on, believing that their raw power alone will overwhelm anything that gets in their way.\nWhen seen in a protagonist, their lack of skill is typically only because it's the first episode and they've only just discovered their powers. The initial stages of the series, if not the series as a whole, will then focus on improving the protagonist's innate talents. It also gives the series a justification for why a complete newbie to whatever power they've uncovered is able to fight with or against people who have more experience, or why they can come along in training relatively quickly. One common type of this is the Super Prototype that the Ordinary High-School Student is Falling into the Cockpit of.\nIn an antagonist, an Unskilled, but Strong character is commonly either the very first foe the protagonist faces or one of the last. In the former case, they're a Starter Villain and may be fond of Badass Boasts but prove all talk in the face of the much more skilled protagonist.

Also compare Germans Love David Hasselhoff, Americans Hate Tingle, Cross-Cultural Kerfluffle, Affectionate Parody, and This Loser Is You.\nSee also and compare Opinion Override. The inverse trope is Offending the Creator's Own, where a work or character is condemned as offensive to a particular group despite the creator being a member of that group. It can be seen as a national version of the more personal Actually Pretty Funny.\n"}
{"TheJoysOfTorturingMooks": "Or, what happens when What Measure Is a Mook? makes out with Video Game Cruelty Potential. Most video games don't flag character actions on the Karma Meter as being evil, as long as they're committed against evil characters. Most cool-looking moves look incredibly painful, and may even have Mooks crying out in agony. Mmm, the sadism.\nNow, strictly speaking, you might not be allowed to kill the little buggers, but this is only a minor restriction when player actions include things like audibly breaking your enemy's bones. In other words, even if they're not dead, those pitiful mooks will be in horrible agony for the rest of their lives as a result of your vicious beatdown. Enjoy, sadistic player!\nSee also Set a Mook to Kill a Mook, if your brand of sadism tends towards \"divide and conquer\".\n"}
{"TroublingUnChildLikeBehavior": "Kids should be kids, at least that's how the saying goes. That means worrying about little kid things and doing little kid things, such as playing on the trampoline, watching TV, going fishing, or whatever it is that kids do locally. What we don't expect kids to do is to drink alcohol, smoke, have sex, use drugs, hitchhike, commit violent crimes, or do other things we associate only with teenagers or adults. Yes, many adults get upset when a teenager drinks beer, but when a 10-year-old does it, outrage turns to concern and worry.\nIn fiction, there's two ways this tends to occur. Sometimes the kid is shown engaging in such behavior as though it's normal for them, and this can be used to show that the child has had a harsh upbringing. Other times, the kid is trying an \"adult\" behavior for the first time, which may sometimes have disastrous consequences.\nThe Creepy Child, the Enfant Terrible and the Evil Orphan draw much of their force from this. The Fake Cutie may also be prone to this, but not all the time. From the Mouths of Babes is the Sub-Trope where the child only says troubling unchildlike things.\nThe Fille Fatale is considered this less than is plausible, since sexual precociousness is often a sign of sexual abuse.\nChild Soldiers are a particularly tragic and horrific example of this.\nFor when kids see things (or have things happen to them) that they shouldn't instead of do things they shouldn't, see Harmful to Minors. A Teenage Wasteland runs on this.\nContrast with Wise Beyond Their Years, which is about positive strangely-adult behavior, Psychopathic Manchild, which is when an adult acts like a child and has disturbing behavior, and Acting Your Intellectual Age, which is neutral.\nNote that if the kid is Really 700 Years Old and just has the physical appearance of a child, it doesn't count. This is for when actual children are the ones engaging in the unchildlike behavior.\nThis is Truth in Television insofar as there are indeed preteens out there who smoke, drink alcohol, have sex with each other, and so on. This is often the result of a neglectful or abusive family.\n"}
{"Magibabble": "Like Techno Babble, but about magic, typically Rule Magic. This is usually used in series where Magic A Is Magic A, and the rules are defined enough that you can't get away with invoking them in new ways without having to explain it first. See also Blah Blah Blah.\n"}
{"SpeakFriendAndEnter": "In any story, there are problems. Characters need to solve those problems. Usually, they do so in the most straightforward way. But sometimes, they create an extremely complex and convoluted plan for what should be a simple solution. They may just plan it, or they may actually go through with it, but often before, during, or after, some other character points out how complicated The Plan is, or what the simplest solution would be.\nCompare with Zany Scheme, which is what happens in a Sitcom when people go through with a complicated scheme (and often, either no one knows or realizes that there was a simpler solution, or there wasn't one).\nCompare with There Was a Door, a specific subtrope where rather than simply opening a door, someone smashes through the door or wall note\u00a0 smashing through is simpler in the short term, and only in the long term is it more complicated) . Also compare Cutting the Knot. May overlap with We Have the Keys if the \"key\" is found before the more violent solution is tried (or after the more violent solution has failed). Don't confuse with Open Sesame, which is when the door is opened with a spoken password.\n"}
{"LotsAndLotsOfCharacters": "A show that has so many regulars that you can't fit them all into one episode. Therefore, one week some characters will appear, while some different characters will appear in another. You'll rarely get the same combination twice. This is especially common in Long-Runners, as characters tend to accumulate over time. Shows with this many characters tend towards one-dimensional characterization for many of them (but not always, if the writers will put in the effort), and often make filler easy to create.\nSimilarly, some video games involve collecting as many distinct, unique soldiers for your army as possible. Other video games, such as fighting games, start with just a few characters but keep adding characters to the roster as more sequels come out, until you eventually have enough characters to populate an entire Verse.\nCreating a Cast of Snowflakes with these loads is an achievement and will make the story lively and colorful. If the writers are smart, they'll start making a Cast Herd. The Love Dodecahedron is a way to spice things up, the Geodesic Cast makes use of the characters through variations on a theme, and The Clan happens when the loads are related. A Character-Magnetic Team can sometimes create this effect. Gets really convoluted if everyone is somehow related.\nPlease note that this is for extreme examples of regularly occurring characters. It's really not all that uncommon for a story to have ten or fifteen characters, especially with a Villain of the Week format.\nThis can cause crediting issues for shows with an OBB (opening billboard), leading to Fake Guest Star or being shunted into the Closing Credits for logistical reasons.\nSee also Crowded Cast Shot. May result in/from You All Share My Story. Can contribute to Continuity Lockout in Long-Runners. Compare Revolving Door Casting and Heroes Unlimited. The inversion of this trope is Minimalist Cast. We have an article on how to write this variety of character roster.\n"}
{"SisyphusVsRock": "Sometimes, the Big Bad is just too darned evil to be Sealed in a Can. Perhaps he already was, and it didn't work. After hammering him time and again, our hero eventually realizes that It's Up to Him, and carries out the Heroic Sacrifice Worse than Death: Trapping themselves in a duel with the bad guy for all eternity, thus effectively \"sealing\" their opponent with themselves as the plug.\nIf they aren't strong enough, the baddy will escape, possibly using its would-be impediment as a Soul Jar.\nThis can also be used as a Back Story, with the release of the Big Bad also releasing the original hero.\nMay invoke Someone Has to Do It. On the other hand, sometimes only their conscience is keeping them on the job.\nSub-trope of Hell Is War. See also Kill Us Both; often overlaps with Enemy Without and Tailor-Made Prison.

{"MonsterFangirl": "Hurray! The heroes have captured the murderer and locked him away, and the day is saved.\nSo why is he getting all this fan mail?\nThe Monster Fangirl (and this is almost Always Female, though the genders may be flipped) might have the belief that Love Redeems, or she's In Love with Your Carnage (in the worst case), or believes that he's really innocent. If she's aware of his evil nature, it's essentially a form of All Girls Want Bad Boys turned Up to Eleven.\nTheir fate is usually to be casually discarded to wind up another victim, or to go to jail for the crimes they commit to aid the Monster, often screaming declarations of love all the way. As a villain is not always redeemed, the woman's deluded attraction to the dangerous psychopath may also be a romantic manifestation of Too Dumb to Live.\nDepressingly this occurs even in Real Life, where it is known as hybristophilia.\nCompare Draco in Leather Pants for when the fandom does it.

For a fangirl of a literal monster in a relationship with one, see Interspecies Romance, Beast and Beauty or You Sexy Beast.\n"}
{"SpaceEpisode": "The story is mostly or totally terrestrially grounded; though there may be space travel, it's not a setting where going into space is a regular or easy task and likely none of the main characters has gone into space \u2014 until now. Maybe just one of them will go up as a means of putting them on a bus or maybe the whole cast goes up for an episode, but it happen only once or twice for the entire run of the story.\nCompare IN SPACE!, which technically doesn't have to do with anything about space.\n"}
{"TheChosenPeople": "Various groups and civilization since before recorded history have considered themselves to be chosen people by a god or goddess. Historical cases operate more on a form of honor's system \u2014 that a specific people or leader claims to have been chosen by what they believe is a real, infallible, supernatural authority and thus this entitles them to privileges and authority not accorded to the rest of their species. In other words, \"Take Our Word for It\". They would then use this word-taken status as a means of claiming dominance, whether it is an assurance that this higher power has granted them ownership of territory, over resources, even over their own fellow man. Anthropologists commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of ethnocentrism.\nIn fiction however, the likelihood of this being true is much higher. When the actual existence of supernatural \u2014 or at least, very amazing and hard-to believe things \u2014 is made known, it is also just as likely that not only does this higher power possess an independent, thinking sentience in the universe, but that it can also pick favorites.\nWhat these Chosen People have been chosen to do varies, but it usually is done as a means to spread their message. The God of Good asks their chosen people to give to charity and spread their messages of love and humility with the promise of its divine protection as they do so. The God of Evil tells them to pillage and torture all they see with guarantees of Heavy Metal blood-orgies in Hell after death. Dagon and Hydra demand human sacrifices in exchange for gills and fins to better enjoy their underwater paradise. A legacy is given to their descendants, carrying on their chosenness by virtue of their very ethnicity (and the traditions and creeds that come with it). This \"chosen society\" may be a target for a villain who thinks they'll be a hindrance to their evil plans, so their living place is likely to get decimated.\nIf the Chosen People seem poor, despondent or massively unimpressive at face value, then they can be a collective version of The Chosen Zero. If the Chosen People actually are poor, despondent or massively unimpressive, then the higher power that chose them was wrong and they are all The Poorly Chosen One. If the creator share a specific homeland with the chosen, then it can be considered a form of divine Creator Provincialism.\nCompare to Tribe of Priests. See also Space Jews. Not to be confused with The Chosen Many.\n"}
{"SubmissiveBadass": "A badass is a leader. They stride in confident, stare The Rival down, and dominate any situation they're in... Except when they don't. This is an index for badasses who shy away from the leader role. They may appear meek and mild at first, but show hidden reserves of strength, or conversely, they may appear strong and confident at first, but show a hidden gentle side. They might submit when the situation demands it, but they never break.\nSometimes overlaps with The Smart Guy as this is most common in smarter characters. Could also be The Lancer, especially to a more classical hero. May be the result of a gentle character having Taken A Level In Badass, but it's also common for them to simply reveal their badassery partway through the story. Could be a work's way of reminding the audience that completing the Training from Hell is a job requirement for all the characters (such as if the characters are law enforcement or military). Such a character has a very strong chance of being The Chosen One. If not, they may be the Reluctant Hero. The Cloudcookoolander has a strong chance of turning into this at the climax of the story. Often a result of Clap Your Hands If You Believe or The Power of Friendship or The Powerof Love, being channeled by a normally useless or weak character.\n"}

{"TruthAndLies": "Truth, lies, and deception. If only it were easier to tell them apart. Listed are multiple tropes that fall into one of the three categories. And The Shades of Fact offers insight into their fictional equivalents.\n"}
{"SuperHeroTrophyShelf": "A Super Hero trope that originated in The Silver Age of Comic Books.\nWay, way back in the campy Silver Age, superheroes usually had too much time on their hands. As did their readers. As such, the superhero should be able to waste time in the same kinds of hobbies as their readers did.\nThat's why we have so many superheroes who are into collecting. But, instead of collecting rocks or strains of alien herpes, they'll collect alien rocks and their enemies' evil weapons. These collections might be all over their base, have their own room in the base, or be only a modest trophy rack with all the keys to different cities they saved from destruction.\nWhen the reader is treated to a view of their collectibles, the result is a Continuity Cavalcade of references to prior plots that often reaches into Scenery Porn territory. Having collectibles that appeared in previous issues is a good way of building the legend around a character, giving space for interesting plots and helps explain why exactly character has such a big Secret Base. Sometimes, it may serve as Chekhov's Boomerang, as the hero takes an old relic from his collection to defeat an enemy that has invaded the hero's lair. On the other hand, some writers just forget all about continuity and say, \"Heroman goes to the room where he keeps a trillion of his old foes' super-trinkets,\" or something. In which case, the trophies are Noodle Implements and Cow Tools that leave the reader/viewer wondering: \"How the heck did he get that?\"\nThis might seem odd today, with the change that both superheroes and the hobby of collecting have gone through. As superheroes started to be more relatable, they had too many problems on their hands to worry about their collections of MacGuffins all the time. And, as children (and, let's face it, adults) became more interested in collecting manufactured items such as Star Wars action figures or even comic books, the idea of having a never-ending collection ceased to exist for those of us who aren't filthy rich.\nAlso, superheroes who put too much thought into their collections began to look like a bunch of overgrown children.\nSuperheroes also have a thing for making shrines to people: Photos of enemies, statues of friends and Love Interests, the chattel that belonged to their old sidekicks, et cetera. This might be a bit creepy to modern readers: \"So, Superman, you really have a room in your fortress filled with depictions of your scantily clad cousin? Why, exactly?\" But it makes sense when you consider that, comics being a visual medium - decades before the Decompressed Comic revolution - it was pretty hard to represent someone's feelings without resorting to clunky speeches like, \"Jane is so beautiful! If only I could tell her how much she means to me! But I dare not...for a girl so lovely would never marry a lame man!\"\nFor examples detailing the collecting exploits of more normal individuals see The Collector of the Strange.

A common component of Vancian Magic. May be subject to Rank Inflation.\nExperience Points get involved when they're used to measure how far a character has progressed towards the next level of ability.\n"}
{"ShapeshifterIdentityCrisis": "What happens when your character with Voluntary Shapeshifting begins to suffer Sanity Slippage?\nYou get a Shapeshifter Identity Crisis, which is the sometimes non-lethal sibling to Shapeshifter Swan Song, and the polar opposite of Shapeshifter Mode Lock.\nYour Shapeshifter character is, for whatever reason, having trouble keeping it together mentally \u2014 so their form switches around in accord with their mental tribulations. The shapeshifter's base identity \u2014 who they are to begin with \u2014 is in danger of getting permanently lost in the mental jumble and resultant physical manifestation of every shape they have ever taken happening at random, on provocation, or if the wind changes.\nMay be triggered as a result of Becoming the Mask, or may result in Becoming the Mask if you have a Manipulative Bastard guiding the person back from the crisis point. It can also be due to The Mind Is a Plaything of the Body, as having many different forms can make determining which one is the \"real you\" a bit more difficult.\nIf the shapeshifter does not survive the crisis, then it's a Shapeshifter Swan Song. If the shapeshifting happens involuntarily due to being sick or some rare condition to the shapeshifter's race, it's Malfunction Malady instead.\nSubtrope to Power Incontinence.\n"}
{"InventingTheWheel": "Nothing to do with Reinventing the Wheel.\nIn any story that takes place in 1 Million B.C., you're going to see someone invent the wheel. Common fodder for It Will Never Catch On. Often the wheel is some shape other than round, indicating that that iteration is probably an Obvious Beta.\n"}
{"WithHilariousResults": "Actions that are dangerous or illegal often lead to injury, arrest, job dismissal, expulsion from school, deportation, or other dire consequences. Thankfully for our fictional friends, both the Rule of Cool and the Rule of Funny keep them safe (the latter more prominently).\nTraditionally seen in the capsule descriptions of episodes found in programming guides: \"Jimbo accidentally glues his boss to a golf cart and hilarity ensues.\" Outside of these descriptions, though, the phrase is usually used sarcastically, indicating that the consequences are anything but hilarious. The less charitable might say that hilarity is what happens for those hearing about it afterward.\nSometimes certain additional criteria are included with the hilarity to help classify it, e.g., \"hilarity ensues, but not in the romcom sense, but rather in the sense of The Story Of Ricky\".\nVariants include \"...with hilarious consequences\" (more common in the UK), \"wackiness ensues\", and \"hijinks ensue.\" In extreme cases \"wacky hijinks ensue.\" Both hijinks and hilarity are often \"aplenty.\" Compare Silliness Switch, when the hilarity is a choice in an otherwise serious medium.\nNot to Be Confused with the webcomic Hijinks Ensue. Or with Humanity Ensues. When something serious happens and it's not played for laughs, you may end up with Reality Ensues.

{"RPGEpisode": "The characters act in an episode emulating an RPG, either Tabletop Games or a console or MMORPG. Either they're playing as characters, having some imaginative dream sequence, or the normal Medieval European Fantasy sequence gets derailed by it. While obscure homages provide Fanservice in some Anime it seems an almost universal requirement to reference the extremely famous Dragon Quest series in some way or another.note\u00a0Curiously enough, the title Dragon Quest sounds so generic that you would think it belonged to a lawyer-friendly Fictional Counterpart of Dungeons & Dragons of the sort which sometimes appear in western television shows, though more often in the '80s than today.\nPossibly because the generation of writers hasn't caught up, MMORPGs haven't gained quite the notoriety. Back to Japan again, most examples will reference a handful of popular titles, such as Ragnarok Online or Final Fantasy XI. Seems to be a particularly common trope for Anime, likely because console gaming in Japan has always been slightly more popular than computer gaming.\nNote this is different from a show adapted from an RPG (that's The Anime of the Game, which is also inclusive of Western examples such as the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon), or a show like .hack which revolves around a fictional MMORPG.\nAn RPG Episode will almost always be Deep-Immersion Gaming, and may introduce us to Ultimate Gamer 386.\n"}
{"Omake": "A bonus that is added to, but separate from, a particular work. The practice of adding such a bonus to one's work has been around for a long, long time: Charles Dickens, for example, was a regular practitioner of it, back when he wrote his stories for newspapers and magazines.\nIf this extra material is another story in the universe, it generally doesn't interact with the primary plot of the work, and is seen as \"stand-alone\" material. Some times that extra material isn't even considered canon, though such additions can add depth and insight to the primary characters if the writer makes an effort to connect the \"extra\" to the main material.\nOther kinds of extras are making-ofs, outtakes, deleted scenes, concept art, feelies and others.\nNearly all types of media feature extras: artwork is popular for anime and manga, particularly holiday art (especially if the artists can draw the ladies in Sexy Santa Dresses); musicians regularly add \"Hidden Tracks\" to their records (though this practice has faded somewhat, as CD players generally play the entire disc, instead of discreet tracks); television producers create extra scenes to be shown over the credits or as online-only \"webisodes\"; movie producers sometimes create whole new short films, just to add as an \"extra\" on the DVD, although nowadays Picture Dramas also often fulfill that role; and comic books often feature \"backup stories\" that are only a handful of pages long. DVD Collector's Editions often come with a reproduction of a prop or another similar bit of memorabilia.\nSome companies have earned scorn from their fans for releasing special editions of their games with 'exclusive bonus content', only to release it to the general player population a few months later.\n\"Omake\" is the anime and manga fanspeak term. \"Lagniappe\" is a Louisiana Creole word commonly used by chefs that means \"a little something extra\" (like a baker's dozen).\nPrint Bonus and Side-Story Bonus Art are Sub Tropes.\n"}
{"CatsAreSnarky": "Many traits associated with cats, including cleverness and contemptuousness (among others), tend also to be associated with Deadpan Snarkers \u2014 coming mainly from the association with cats as being aloof, unaffected, coming off as superior, and being associated with sense and grace. As such, it only makes sense that some works would have some cats be among their most sarcastic characters, whether as verbally-sarcastic talking cats or as Silent Snarkers. This could sometimes involve a cat as a Snarky Non-Human Sidekick.\nNote that this trope isn't JUST about domestic cats, or even about cats that look like domestic cats either. It could apply to bigger cats as well.\n"}
{"AbsentFather": "A subtrope of Parental Abandonment: The father of a character or characters is missing or absent.\nPerhaps he's dead, or maybe he was murdered. Perhaps he's left and there's bitterness involved. Perhaps he's off fighting evil. Or maybe it's psychological absence \u2014 he's physically there, but is completely negligent in his fatherly duties. Regardless of what happened \u2014 and regardless of whether or not the viewers find out what happened \u2014 Mom seems to have raised her children on her own, or with the help of a father substitute.\nThere's a bit of a Double Standard in fiction regarding single parents. A Disappeared Dad is far less likely to have his absence explained than a Missing Mom. When he's not in the picture, it's often taken for granted that he's either dead or a deadbeat and the story just keeps moving along with no thought to his whereabouts. But if he is alive, he is more likely to return and reconcile, or be a non-entity who sporadically appears just to remind the hero that Daddy doesn't care about them. note\u00a0The flipside is that if both parents are absent, the character is far more likely to be obsessed with his or her lost father. Characters who have lost both parents often do not mention the lost mother at all, or she doesn't play nearly as large a role in the backstory. It is also possible for the Disappeared Dad to not know he's a dad at all. Unlike the Missing Mom, he doesn't actually have to be present during childbirth. The mother could very well be justified in keeping the father out of the loop. When this type of Disappeared Dad is actually an established character, you get Luke, You Are My Father.\nCompare and contrast this with Missing Mom. Combine the two, and you get Parental Abandonment. Sometimes, though, Daddy Had a Good Reason for Abandoning You. If Dad is dead, we may see a Happier Home Movie. If he is simply too busy to be with his child, it's When You Coming Home, Dad?. If he doesn't have a lot of time but is willing to spend money on gifts and trips for the kids, it's Disneyland Dad.

{"Dojikko": "(Pronounced \"doh-jeek-koh\".)\nDojikko (\u30c9\u30b8\u3063\u5b50) is Japanese for clumsy with the feminine suffix \"-ko\" added on the end. In other words: \"clumsy child\". The word can be used to describe people of both genders. It has also become a major \"element of Moe\" in anime and manga, and Anime Fanspeak for Cute Clumsy Girl. The attraction is not limited to Japan, the concept of a Cute Clumsy Girl has worldwide appeal, mainly because her clumsiness makes her more approachable.\nThe main difference is that in the West a Cute Clumsy Girl is probably supposed to make the audience chuckle, while Dojikkos tend towards making them say, \"Awwww! She's so cute!\" However, the core concepts overlap so much that all examples should be put on the Cute Clumsy Girl page. You should also go there for a more general summary of how this interacts with other tropes. This page serves to define the fan term, provide some detail on how it is used in anime works and fandom, and discuss trope combinations that are common in anime but not the West.\nTo be labeled a dojikko, all a girl has to be is clumsy in a cute way. So an anime fan could use Dojikko to refer Western examples as well. Still, there are a few noticeable differences between anime dojikko and western examples.\nWestern examples tend to tack on clumsiness to an otherwise already established character idea so as make her more approachable. Anime examples tend to start out building a Moe character and often select Dojikko as a starting point, although Dojikkos almost always have additional moe elements added to create a \"twofer\" (or more) in the moe department. Because of this a dojikko is much more likely to appear as a supporting character in an anime because she's an easy addition to appeal to a large fanbase. Western works tend to use cute clumsiness as a way to humanize the heroine, while western Plucky Comic Relief tends to just be The Klutz.\nSome of the more common additional moe elements include:\nApparently there are some subsets of anime culture that use dojikko as short hand to refer specifically to The Pollyanna + The Ditz + Submissive variation. This is probably the most common subtype of dojikko, and might make up as much as 1/3 of all anime dojikkos.\nAs another aspect of the character, Fanservice can play a large role in the character type. \"Accidental\" pratfalls often result in Panty Shots (no Magic Skirts here), and there is often plenty of overlap with Ms. Fanservice in this trope. (Unless they're going for a more innocent emotional connection).\nThe popularity of this character among the anime subculture of Japan has led to a proliferation of these characters in anime, thanks in no small part to their ability to sell The Merch. Expect figurines, wall scrolls, and full-sized body pillows. Because of this, they may be added as a way of expanding the marketability of a show, much like the Token Mini-Moe. Expect Tareme Eyes.\nSee Cute Clumsy Girl for examples.\n"}
{"UnwinnableByMistake": "\nUnwinnable gameplay states are those in which it is impossible for the player to finish the game. The only options are to reload a previous save (if possible) or start the game anew.\nUnwinnable By Mistake situations are generally the result of either a game-breaking glitch or a design oversight, such as allowing a player to advance through the game without picking up a vital item and not letting them return to get the item afterwards. Saved games may also be made immediately before imminent death or with too little health to survive the current predicament. Making every save viable requires building the game around it and is not always feasible. Games with save-anywhere systems are particularly susceptible, as emulator users with save states often find out.\nMany games urge you to keep and continually update multiple save files should you encounter an unwinnable situation. Autosaves and automated reloads have become more extensive, while save points now tend to heal. Unwinnability is shunned across the board.\nHowever, games with poorly placed autosave points can often save the player's position in unwinnable situations, e.g. with too little health or ammo to survive a battle after the Point of No Return. Even worse, they often don't allow you to keep multiple saves, so you are totally screwed over and have to restart the level/mission/game.note\u00a0With PC games, this can often be circumvented by manually backing up the save files to a different location, or sometimes by simply renaming the save file to something like \"PreviousSaveFile.backup\"; this is a lot harder to do with mobile or console games, however, and generally impossible with browser games (which either saves in the form of cookies, something extremely challenging to backup and requires plenty of fiddling, or don't store any save files locally).\nThere has been serious research in using verification techniques to automatically detect Unwinnable By Mistake problems in games, e.g. Martineau's PNFG (2006). For example, in Halo 2 and 3, if you die a certain number of times at a checkpoint, you revert to the previous checkpoint.\nIn contrast, if the game has specifically been programmed to place the player in an unwinnable situation, it is Unwinnable by Design. If you deliberately did something convoluted in the game that rendered it unwinnable, it is Unwinnable by Insanity.\n"}
{"ArmyOfTheDead": "The Evil Army is about to overrun our stronghold! Hold the Line tactics worked just fine until The Dragon showed up and smashed a bloody great hole in our defenses. It looks like the enemy has won... but wait! The wizard has finished that spell he was working on! There's a horn sounding over the horizon.\nWait... why are all our fallen comrades in the courtyard stirring? Is that army coming over the hills... translucent?\nMan, I sure am glad the army of the dead is on our side. They're tearing The Evil Army right up. I sure hope we can keep these guys around! ...What do you mean, \"good for one battle only?\"\nThe essence of this trope is: Fallen allies, usually having died either in the battle at hand or in a previous battle with the same enemy, rise temporarily from the dead en masse and contribute to the ongoing battle in some critical way. The undead in question are more likely to be spectral than physical, but both are possible. The important part is that the loyalty of the fallen is preserved. Also, the army of the dead can help win the (usually climactic or highly significant) battle, but they can't then join the standing army. They tend only to last until the immediate threat is vanquished.\nThe Trope Namer and possibly also modern Trope Codifier is the army of the dead from The Lord of the Rings. However, it's Older Than They Think.\nSee Also: The Cavalry, Big Damn Heroes, Desperation Attack. Contrast Animate Dead, and Night of the Living Mooks, where the original loyalty of the raw materials isn't relevant. If the dead in question died in different time periods, they may also be an Army of the Ages. Related to The Wild Hunt. For villainous example, see Necromancer and The Undead.\nENDING TROPE!

{"Biopunk": "Bio Punk combines Punk Punk with Organic Technology and Bio-Augmentation, usually centered around genetic engineering and biotechnology. Expect to see a lot of Organic Technology, sculpted physiques and Petting Zoo People walking around... or hopping, swimming, flying, slithering, etc. Many buildings and ships will be grown, and a general Womb Level aesthetic will usually prevail. Issues examined may include Designer Babies, What Measure Is a Non-Human?, what is human, various aspects of ecology and effects of modified crops/animals/bacteria. And you'll see Aesops (particularly Green Aesops about creating what you can't control), both real and Fantastic.\nIt should be noted that the line between Bio Punk and Cyber Punk is very thin, and the majority of cyberpunk stories will contain some limited Bio Punk elements. The line between Bio Punk and Post-Cyberpunk is sometimes even thinner and less gross, with Post-Cyberpunk sharing many more elements with Biopunk in addition to not using as many Cyberpunk elements as its precursor due to being a Fuzzy concept. And the last one is between Bio Punk and Solar Punk will use some or more elements but instead as a good thing for future all species and subverted almost everything the former example above paragraph said.\n"}
{"ColorCodedArmies": "In Strategy Games, when a player gazes at the map, it's convenient to know exactly which of the units are yours, which are the enemy's, and which may be unaligned. In order to make this easy for the player, units will be color-coded so that the player can tell at a glance.\nAlthough this can be Justified by military uniforms, this can often apply even to units that are not members of a military force or haven't joined your (or the enemy's) side yet. In fact, an astute player may be able to tell a future ally or enemy by the color of their clothing, before they utter a single line or take any actions.\nIn single-player games, the side controlled by the player will be a \"good\" or \"heroic\" color, while the enemy side will be an \"evil\" color. Most commonly, these colors will be blue and red, respectively. (Green and red is usually avoided as it's the most common form of color blindness.) Although if there are more than two factions, green and yellow are usually the next colors to show up. This tradition goes back to the early 19th century when members of the newly founded Prussian Military Academy developed Kriegsspiel, the first tabletop wargame and predecessor of all modern RTS and turn based strategy video games. And since the Prussian Army had just adopted the new uniforms in Prussian Blue, blue became the default color for allied troops and red the color of enemy troops, which may even have established the modern Good Colors, Evil Colors.\nThis effect may be accomplished by a Palette Swap in two-dimensional games, but not always. It's also just as common in three-dimensional games. The colored units can be shown on an Enemy-Detecting Radar.\nThere are generally 4 versions of this:\nSubtrope of Colour-Coded for Your Convenience. See also Color-Coded Multiplayer.\n"}
{"Shibboleth": "A character needs to prove his identity or situation to another character who's not likely to believe him. Maybe he's from the future, or he's some other character reincarnated. Maybe he has to pass a God Test. He might even have to prove his identity to his past or future self. That's when he breaks out the Trust Password \u2014 something that will prove his identity beyond a shadow of a doubt.\nTrust Passwords come in several forms. Very often, it will be Something Only They Would Say. It can be set up in advance as a Covert Distress Code or a form of Spy Speak (often in sign/countersign form). It could be specialized knowledge of certain facts or events. Or it could be an object that has a special significance (such as an object that's been separated in half, so if you have one half only someone you trust has the other).\nThe trope can be Played for Laughs quite easily \u2014 the skeptical character might not believe an otherwise airtight password, or the password might be common knowledge such that anyone can easily impersonate the character.\nAnd it's not related to Safe Word. (Usually.)\n"}
{"TemporaryBulkChange": "In most western animations and anime, you have a character whose size can moderately or drastically change for just a few minutes as the scene calls it, or even for the whole episode. However, when the scene or episode ends, usually the affected character will be back at their regular size as if nothing ever happened. Characters may either gain weight, lose weight, grow muscles, or be inflated with air or liquid according to the script. Rarely used in live-action television and/or film since the actor has to wear heavy padding and special make-up, which is expensive and makes them very uncomfortable.\nNot to be confused with Incredible Shrinking Man or Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever. Compare Balloon Belly. The Heavy Voice is sometimes a side-effect of this trope.\n"}
{"TakeCover": "For a long time, video game protagonists either relied on dodging if they were One Hit Point Wonders, or simply soaked up the damage if they were Made of Iron. Taking cover was certainly possible, but it simply consisted of stepping behind walls.\nThen the system changed. Cover and systems for using it effectively have become automated to an extent. The first examples of formalization like this in First and Third Person Shooters were \"duck,\" \"lean left\" and \"lean right\" keys present for quick peeks and potshots, often inherited from Stealth Games. Pressing a button causes your character to press up against nearby objects, sidle left and right along them, and peek around corners. With another button, one can either fire blindly, or expose oneself to rapidly aim and shoot. A third person shooter with a cover system is a member of the \"cover-based shooter\" sub-genre.\nMany cover systems exaggerate the safety of cover by allowing the player to see around corners the character can't (some first person games even jump to a 3rd-person camera when sidling against cover for this reason,) allowing them to pre-aim or designate targets from behind cover, rendering them invisible to enemies while they lean around corners, or even letting them fire aimed shots from behind cover. In essence, this is an inversion of Behind the Black.\nGames based on this trope are guaranteed to be full of waist-high obstacles to duck behind, no matter what environment you're in, and they're all inexplicably bulletproof.\nIn a strategy game, Geo Effects might provide a defensive bonus for units in cover, or Garrisonable Structures for infantry to use as cover. See also Corridor Cubbyhole Run, a favorite level design choice for a cover-based shooter; and Die, Chair! Die! for destructible objects, which might be good cover exactly once. And please, don't try to take cover behind the random barrels of explosives. Using a person as cover is its own trope.\nWhile not a new concept (as certain games are made so tough you want to find a barrier between you and your enemy even if you don't have a formalized cover system), the wild success of Gears of War led to its replication in a long series of what are effectively Follow the Leader games. It's basically RPG Elements for gaming, and a reflection of changing tastes.\n"}
{"LawfulEvil": "The Dungeons & Dragons Character Alignment system originally defined characters' moral dispositions only on a Law/Chaos axis, with Law seen as usually involving moral goodness, and Chaos, evil. Eventually, Good/Evil was introduced as a separate parameter. One reason for this was the slightly odd but not all that rare case of characters who are clearly evil, but nevertheless organised, consistent, rule-abiding, or maybe even trustworthy and reasonable in their own limited way \u2014 in other words, Lawful Evil.\nA Lawful Evil character is an evil character who either tries to impose or uphold a lawful system on others without regard for their wishes, and/or adheres to a particular code. They believe in order, but mostly because they believe it is the best way of realizing their evil wishes. They will obey the letter of the law, but not the spirit, and are usually very careful about giving their word. However, there is also the Knight Templar variant, who believes their rules actually make them the good guy \u2014 when they and their rules have in truth ended up at the lower end of the slippery slope to evil and tyranny.\nThough Lawful Evil characters are often found in charge, these characters also make good henchmen or mooks. Though they lack any moral scruples that may impair their work, a cautious villain will find they respond well to concepts like \"loyalty\", \"duty\" and \"honour\". The caution, however, should be remembered, as these characters also respond poorly to Bad Bosses and Dirty Cowards,note\u00a0not that a Dirty Coward who is themselves Lawful Evil is something unheard of, far from it, as well as simple incompetence that could lead them to deciding to either find a more worthy master, or take over \"for the good of the cause\".\nLawful Evil tends to be, especially when it's working within an established system, the hardest type of evil to get rid of. If the system itself is evil then it's Inherent in the System and thus the evil parts can't be changed without major upheaval or the complete destruction of the system. If the system is being used by evil individuals, it's just as hard if not harder to stop them as these types often perpetrate Loop Hole Abuse combined with Rules Lawyer to make it impossible to separate where the legal parts end and the illegal parts begin. Lastly, if the evil isn't part of a large system but rather as a group, it's still difficult to stop as the those that are part of the group are generally doing it by following an ideal and You Cannot Kill An Idea so even if the current version of the group is stopped, it may not prevent a new version following the same ideals from emerging.\nLawful Evil usually comes in at least three flavors:\nAll variants are likely to take advantage of Questionable Consent, pushing people into \"agreements\" and then pushing them to uphold their end of the \"bargain\".\nLawful Evil characters may not be motivated by anything but a paycheck. Many soldiers and henchmen working for an evil government or ruler fall into the \"lawful evil\" category by default. Being a genuinely committed member of a military organization makes one lawful by default, and if the government or ruler one works for is evil, then one naturally falls into the category of \"lawful evil.\"\nIf you have a difficulty deciding which alignment an evil-aligned character belongs to, the main difference between Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil and Chaotic Evil is not their devotion to their evil wishes, but the methods they believe are best to realize it:\nIn a nutshell, these are a variety of evil characters who don't care if what they do is \"heinous\" or \"horrible\", but who will always follow certain rules.\nSuch characters are, for example:\nA warlord who would kill anyone who threatens him \u2014 and, let's say, would always spare the enemies that can serve him; or someone who believes in playing by the story conventions; or a villain whose word is absolutely binding but would still kill a pregnant woman; or any kind of evil character that might commit mass genocide but for some reason Will Not Tell a Lie. Or a character who does, without flinching, anything their master orders them to do, anything, because their one rule is absolute obedience. A Lawful Evil character can also be an Omnicidal Maniac just as easily as Neutral Evil or Chaotic Evil can be; in such cases, they usually either hold Fantastic Racism towards all other living beings or they wish to impose a new order by annihilating everything and starting from scratch.\nRemember, being Lawful does not imply at all that you have any moral standards, and any one of these character archetypes have just as much potential as a Neutral Evil or Chaotic Evil character to be truly despicable. Being Lawful may involve some kind of ethical values or moral codes, but they're more about abstract rules than actually caring about other people; alternatively, a lawful character may work within and abuse the rules. Lawful Evil is not always the \"nicest\" of the Evil alignments, though in individual cases the Lawfulness may make for a Noble Demon. It is just the most consistent and orderly. In short, an evil character who feels that the rules is what gives them strength or superiority. This includes upholding Evil as an ideal in and of itself, coupled with a sense of duty to promote it wherever possible and by any means. They're likely to have standards, but they're just as likely to have a warped moral code regardless. Notably, Hextor, the iconic god of Lawful Evil in Dungeons & Dragons is not sympathetic in the slightest. That being said, many, perhaps most evil characters who end up siding with heroes permanently without undergoing a Heel\u2013Face Turn tend to be Lawful Evil, as they are the most likely of the evil alignments to work within the system; type 1s are particularly prone to this, due to their views on order.\nFinally, it should be remembered that while many Lawful Evil types (particularly type 1 types) may value the law and may obey it in many cases, being Lawful Evil does not necessarily mean that the character will necessarily obey the actual laws of the land \u2014 many of them are fully prepared to commit illegal acts or to twist the laws to their own purposes, and even to annihilate entire systems or civilizations. A Type 1 may justify this by saying they are trying to create a superior lawful society; a Type 2 may assume that their own personal code supersedes any loyalty to the authority of mere mortals; a Type 3 may think that the only law they obey is that of their own masters. No Lawful alignment is necessarily inclined to obey every law or any law.\nSee Also: Lawful Good , Neutral Good, Chaotic Good, Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil\nLawful Evil type typically includes:\nOn works pages: Character Alignment is only to be used in works where it is canonical, and only for characters who have alignments in-story. There is to be no arguing over canonical alignments, and no Real Life examples, ever.\n"}
{"SelfmadeOrphan": "What might be considered the inverse of Offing the Offspring, and is an equally aberrant behavior, is when a character murders their own parents. Any character behaving this way will probably be Ax-Crazy and/or a Psycho for Hire. An Evil Prince can also do that if he's impatient enough. It's the ultimate mark of an Enfant Terrible or Antagonistic Offspring, the end result of a Betrayal by Offspring, and a likely origin of an Evil Orphan.\nIt can be justified if the parents happen to be abusive or cruel mockeries of humanity from beyond the void \u2014 insofar as murder can be, but at least it's then the domain of the dark and troubled protagonists. It's more justifiable if the parent is an outright villain. In addition, there are also instances where the child either unintentionally killed his parents or something genuinely horrific happened to his/her parents that they are forced to kill them. It can also be justifiable if said parent was going to be Offing the Offspring anyway, and needed to defend him/herself and had no choice.\nContrast with Even Bad Men Love Their Mamas, which is based on the premise that no one, no matter how bad, would act this way. If it happens before the murderer is born, this is the Grandfather Paradox. If only the father is killed and it's played for drama then it would be Patricide. If it's the mother that's being killed, which tends to be portrayed as downright self-destructive, that would be Matricide. The extreme version, where a person kills not just their parents but their entire people or clan is Genocide from the Inside.\nOne subversion is to have this happen by accident and/or for the parents' death be ultimately caused by their own actions involving the child. If said parent's child also happens to be a Mook of the parent, it can also overlap into The Dog Bites Back.\nA subtrope of Murder in the Family.\n"}
{"InescapableAmbush": "A specific type of enemy encounter common in a variety of video game genres. When the player enters a specific area, some type of barrier is closed around the player character (even one as simple as a door that mysteriously shuts and locks itself), and they cannot leave these narrow confines until all the available enemies are defeated.\nThis is commonly used as a way to set up a Boss Battle (though not all Boss Battles are Inescapable Ambushes).\nIn some games, if your characters gain enough experience in a certain trait, such as awareness or agility, they may be able to detect potential ambushes and/or evade them entirely.\nA huge cause of Useless Useful Stealth. Longer or more plot-involved examples may extend into an Involuntary Group Split. Sub-Trope of Kill Enemies to Open.\n"}
{"Kaitou": "The Phantom Thief is a special class of criminal. An elusive and fantastic thief who can be long gone before the victim even knows what hit him. Just as likely to be an antihero as a villain.\nThere is no single set model of the Phantom Thief, but they usually have some of the following characteristics.\nBonus points given if the character is known for being a Sharp-Dressed Man sporting a Cool Hat (especially one reminiscent of nice-looking yet out of style fashions). This is particularly common in Japanese media, stemming from the popularity of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin in Japan. The Japanese word for it is Kaitou.\nCompare Gentleman Thief and Classy Cat-Burglar, both of which can overlap with this trope. If part of their motivation is the thrill of stealing, then they may have Sticky Fingers. See also Loveable Rogue and Anti-Hero. Does not require that the thief in question be an actual phantom, though such a character can still fit this trope. And it definitely does not refer to a thief who steals ghosts.\n"}
{"YouCallThatAWound": "Important non-player characters are, well, important. So, when one of these characters enters combat, there's a number of possible ways that they can be treated during battle. Sometimes, a character's survival is plot dependent; in this case, the dreaded Escort Mission takes place when it becomes the player's goal to safeguard Important Character X from harm. In other cases, such as real-time strategy games, Important Character X is a combat unit that can fight, but needs to survive the mission, such as in StarCraft and Age of Empires. This effectively means the character needs to be both utilized as a resource and protected at the same time (Or you just keep them out of combat entirely).\nHowever, backlash against Escort Missions in general has led to a new variation on the usage of Important Characters in combat. When a battle is joined, one doesn't need to concern themselves with the survival of Important Character X, because either they're unable to be seriously injured, they respawn if killed, or, in RTS games, can simply be replaced, usually at considerable cost. Getting shot, stabbed, decapitated, eaten alive, blown up in an Earth-Shattering Kaboom, it doesn't matter; these guys keep on going, laughing off what would kill anyone else, demanding to know if, in reality, wimps like you call that a wound?\nThis trope's name comes from General Sturnn's build-completion quote in Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War: Winter Assault, which in the single-player campaign would only be spoken if he was killed in battle and rebuilt. The implication being that he was only wounded, brought back to base to be tended to, and stormed right back onto the battlefield as soon as he was conscious again. This quote was likely inspired by Arthur's fight with the Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail where the gradually dismembered Black Knight claimed the loss of both arms was \"just a flesh wound.\"\n"}
{"Discontinuity": "Discontinuity is when something that was a part of the continuity is no longer regarded or completely changed. There are a number of reasons for this happening (fixing a Plot Hole, changing it to cater to the fans, etc.) and whether or not the changes are canon depends on the person. Discontinuity is separated into three categories:\nUsage may also refer to:\nOne of the meta-causes of Alternate Universe.\nThis is a disambiguation page. If you can, correct the link that brought you here, or leave a comment there that the link has changed to one of the above. If it was Fanon Discontinuity, then move it to the Subjectives.\n"}
{"EarthDrift": "A work or series that starts out with many more ties to the real world than it later has. This is especially jarring if it is set in another world or universe. As the series goes on, re-viewing/reading/playing the oldest installments becomes disconcerting (if the reader is more familiar with the more recent installments) as a result of similarities to the real world being more frequent. Usually happens as a result of the work's mythology not being fully defined, or a Schr\u00f6dinger's Gun that left a few traces of the original plan.\nMay not necessarily require the real-world references being in older works. This trope can still apply when you find a real-world reference in a newer installment and find it odd.\nSubtrope of Early Installment Weirdness and typically a result of Continuity Drift. Related to Old Shame, Art Evolution and Characterization Marches On. It may also be quite deliberate, as an aversion of Reed Richards Is Useless. Will sometimes invoke the Celebrity Paradox, which is when the popular culture of our world does not exist in the fictional world (because that world is itself part of our pop culture). Contrast Fictional Earth, when a world remains identified as Earth, but is otherwise very different. See also Doing In the Scientist, which is when a previously \"realistic\" work becomes fantasy-based.\n"}
{"ComicallyMissingthePoint": "A character completely misses a really obvious point for comic effect. The point is the sort of thing that any reasonable or informed person will spot and understand given a few seconds or enough information. However, the center of this trope is a person who, despite having all the time in the world and all the information, comes to a conclusion so wrong it's hard to be even further from correct. Commonly elicits a response along the lines of \"that's not what's wrong here\". Visual gags are often involved.\nA Sister Trope to Dramatically Missing the Point.\nFor the fandom equivalent, see Misaimed Fandom.\nCompare Are You Pondering What I'm Pondering?, Bad News in a Good Way, Bait-and-Switch Comment, Cloudcuckoolander, Failed a Spot Check, Not Actually the Ultimate Question, I Take Offense to That Last One!, The Ditz, Mistaken for Profound, Need a Hand, or a Handjob?, and Insane Troll Logic (logic that consists of comically missing the point).\nNo real life examples, please. We'll have to spend a lot of money just to make another subpage for real life.  Note\u00a0The actual reason being that it's too common and attracts natter.\n"}
{"AnimalThemeNaming": "A common form of Theme Naming is to name things after animals. The animals may be unrelated, or they may all be of a particular type, such as snakes or dogs.\nIf the name is for a chracter, the animal chosen tends to say something about the character's personality. Someone named after a bear will tend to be rough, aggressive, and not subtle at all, while one named after a snake will tend to be more sneaky and cunning. Dogs tend to be loyal and good friends, while birds may be flighty. If said theme naming is because characters are that animal, or can take its form, this trope will often overlap with A Dog Named \"Dog\". Is often a component of being an Animal-Themed Superbeing.\nKangaroos and Wallabies\nOther Australian Wildlife\n"}
{"DivineBirds": "The logic is pretty simple: the gods, as everyone knows, live somewhere up in the sky. Birds also inhabit the sky, or at least spend more time there than any other creature in common experience. Therefore, birds have a special connection with the divine. Many cultures see birds as bearers of omens, whether good or bad depending on the type of bird, and some go even farther, with myths and tales depicting them as messengers proffering instructions and advice to mortals, or even providing services of some sort. Angels, additionally, are often depicted as winged and are seen mainly as messengers of God in scripture.\nSpecific species of bird can be associated with certain gods. Eagles are particular favorites and often serve the Top God of a particular pantheon; however, note that eagles are also used to represent mundane values and so are not always part of this trope. If the writer is feeling more fantastically-inclined, mythical birds such as phoenixes might get used. Gods of death or the underworld have their own preferred representatives which would best be avoided: see Creepy Crows and Owl Be Damned. Vultures are another popular choice. Other flighted creatures are sometimes seen in the same way: see Butterfly of Death and Rebirth and Macabre Moth Motif. Birds being seen as sinister in general are Feathered Fiends.\n"}
{"KarmaMeter": "Some games employ a type of morality in their gameplay. Actions taken within the game affect the player, and sometimes how the player is treated by the plot and NPC. This happens even if there were no witnesses to the action and no circumstances that point to you. Some games will make it impossible for one to continue if their Karma Meter is too low, or give a bad ending. Others will simply result in the character having an \"evil alignment\" and playing this way.\nIn some games, it doesn't matter whether you're good or bad but how far you lean to one side is rewarded \u2014 there are bonuses for being very good or very evil but not moderate. This has the annoying side effect of rewarding if not forcing the doing of completely pointless acts of malice, killing beggars and robbing empty houses just to be \"more evil\", and punishing an evil player for doing good quests or deeds (depending on how harsh the meter is) and vice versa, stifling any real choice altogether.\nFurthermore, games with a Karma Meter often include a Golden Snitch decision that will heavily push you towards (or even lock you permanently in) one extreme of the morality gauge regardless of your actions up to that point. This means that in a game with Multiple Endings, your ending is decided more by that one single choice rather than an accumulation of all of your deeds and misdeeds.\nExcept for the Golden Snitch event, typically no act is more than three to five times more evil or good than any other. This leads to the odd situation where a character with a perfect record of finding lost pets and helping old ladies with their groceries can bludgeon a school bus of Girl Scouts to death and pour napalm on their corpses while singing hymns to Satan and scarfing down a stack of Kitten Burgers and at worst go from \"saintly\" to \"very good\" on the Karma Meter. And unless the Karma changes are limited to plot events, go right back to \"saintly\" by killing some monsters or giving money to beggars.\nDespite its flaws, the trope has its purposes, not least of which is maintaining consequences to the player's actions in the absence of Story Branching. The player makes hundreds or even thousands of choices over the course of a game, and developing the game to include direct, ongoing consequences for all those decisions would be extremely taxing from both a writing and programming perspective. Thus, for the sake of feasibility, many developers just stick with this trope, having the Non Player Characters and game world react less to each specific choice you're making and more to your current position on the Karma Meter instead, allowing the player lots of flexibility in how they choose to play while avoiding the rigorous workload demands that the equivalent amount of Story Branching would entail. (That said, plenty of games use both tropes, and games that go the whole nine yards and give nearly all your specific choices lasting consequences, such as the Mass Effect series, aren't unheard of, either.)\nMay be paired with Video Game Caring Potential and/or Video Game Cruelty Potential, making players more inclined to select one side. Compare Relationship Values and Alliance Meter. If your position on the karma meter is displayed on the player character, it's Character Model Karma Meter. See also Character Alignment, Sanity Meter and 100% Heroism Rating.\n"}
{"TheCombatPragmatist": "Some fights have rules. Most don't. However, a lot of people will still fight as though there are rules.\nHeh... suckers.\nThe Combat Pragmatist is a character who is defined by his or her willingness to do anything in a fight to win.\nThis typically applies to \"real\" fights where there's actually something at stake that's more important than a cash prize, a trophy, or a title belt, and usually not professional fights in a controlled environment where safeguards are in place to prevent one side from suffering too much damage and where one can be disqualified for not abiding by the rules. In such settings, the Combat Pragmatist is an unsympathetic character (usually the main antagonist) who shows through his ruthlessness that he honors nothing \u2014 not his opponents, not the sport and its customs, not the tournament's sacred history \u2014 but winning.\nThese characters are characterized by an extensive knowledge of tactics others may consider \"dirty\" fighting or just by a willingness to use those tactics to achieve their goal, often against more \"honorable\" opponents (i.e. Genre Blind ones). They are likely to think of any adherence to rules or sporting combat as Honor Before Reason.\nThey do not suffer from a Complexity Addiction, are never afraid to use a Mundane Solution (nor do they need it to be pointed out to them), never assume that the other person will fight \"honorably\", have no interest in a Self-Imposed Challenge, don't care if their opponent is a worthy one, and will not hesitate to Kick Them While They Are Down. They almost always have their weapon of choice either on them or near them at all times, and possibly a spare or two. If not, they're willing to use absolutely anything as a weapon and only resort to Good Old Fisticuffs if there's no weapon nearby.\nThey will not hesitate to use a Dangerous Forbidden Technique. They have no compunction about hurting a child. Or about attacking someone from behind. Or throwing sand in their eyes. Or pulling down their pants (or flipping up their skirts if dealing with women or a kilt-wearing man). Or the \"Hey, You!\" Haymaker. Or biting them. Or using Weighted Gloves. Or a Groin Attack. Or pretending to surrender. Or... well, you get the idea. However, there can be different levels of this. Even those who don't believe in fighting fair may still have lines they won't cross, such as refusing to kill or not hurting anyone who's not already part of the fight.\nOften overlaps with the No-Nonsense Nemesis, Anti Heroes, and especially Ninja. They almost never allow honor or sentiment to cloud their judgement, will usually take measures to avoid setbacks, or betrayal.. Sometimes Weak, but Skilled or Too Clever by Half, though the truly pragmatic former will constantly seek to increase his power level and hence advantage over his enemies. It can look like Confusion Fu in practice \u2014 but it almost always isn't. If The Unfettered fights, then he'll be one of these.\nThis can be an Establishing Character Moment. It can also be divisive, both among the audience and In-Universe, due to Moral Myopia \u2014 the hero is a resourceful badass, while the villain is just a dirty cheater. This can lead to instances of Black and Gray Morality, showing that the hero and the villain are Not So Different, and the difference between someone being a terrorist or a freedom fighter. For heroes, it's possible for these tactics, if extreme enough, to lead to What the Hell, Hero? moments or claims of If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him, sometimes resulting in responses of I Did What I Had to Do, and in extreme cases, can be a metaphor for Slowly Slipping Into Evil that represents the start or conclusion of a Face\u2013Heel Turn.\nVillains can also be pragmatic, though it usually takes on a different form. Villains being normal Combat Pragmatists is usually averted, or at least not played out completely straight, as it can possibly even lead to them being victorious. If they are, it means they avert Bond Villain Stupidity and actually kill the hero instead of having dinner with him. Depending on the context, using these tactics can be their Kick the Dog moment or even their crossing of the Moral Event Horizon.\nCharacters are often deliberately not put into this trope due to Rule of Cool. If everyone took this approach to combat who could, key characters would be dead or defeated too soon and the story would be over a little too quickly. Plus, it's often just way cooler to show off more complicated tactics than simple ones. Additionally, Moral Guardians and Media Watchdogs sometimes make having this type of character difficult by ensuring that they can't do certain actions. On the other hand, when drawn-out straight fights are impractical, excitement can be created by Genre Shift away from pure action to espionage, planning, intrigue and the thrill of the hunt, with clever heroes and villains alike who avoid the Idiot Ball and unnecessary flash, and any open violence being quick and decisive, however, this character can come as a Family-Unfriendly Aesop that is right, \"Cheating in a fight with no rules is not cheating\" and \"If you want to defeat the bad guys, you don't have to fight fair with them\". The Obligatory War-Crime Scene is a related trope.\nNot to be confused with Why Don't You Just Shoot Him? (although often is a subversion of that trope).\n"}
{"MysteryMagnet": "A Mystery Magnet attracts mysteries, usually murders, with the occasional case of kidnapping, extortion and fraud for variety. Wherever they go, people drop dead at their feet, often with a cryptic dying message. This behaviour isn't planned by anyone \u2014 there is no killer stalking the magnet, nor is the magnet responsible for the deaths \u2014 it's just pure coincidence.\nOf course, this is all arranged by the show's creators so that the magnet always has something interesting to do.\nIf the Mystery Magnet stays in one spot, such as a little town called Cabot Cove, Maine, long enough, enough corpses will soon accumulate that one would expect people to wonder why exactly their quiet-sleepy-little-town is so unlucky. If this happened in real life the police would suspect the magnet of being a serial killer and would question them frequently; in fiction there may be some Lampshade Hanging about the unlikelihood of it all, but it seldom goes beyond that.\nThe Mystery Magnet will generally become an Amateur Sleuth in self defence. If not, they'll be a sidekick of the police detective who solves all the cases they stumble into. Some are cases of little old ladies investigating. Others are Kid Detectives. Not all amateur sleuths are mystery magnets, however. Some amateurs, and most professionals, deliberately go to the crime scene and investigate. With mystery magnets, it's the exact reverse; the crime scene comes to them, by seeming chance.\nSometimes an entire ensemble can be a Mystery Magnet. When professional detectives are on Busman's Holiday, they can often temporarily become mystery magnets, but this trope is only for those who are like that all the time.\nVery often these are Murder Mystery Magnets, leading to Unfortunate Implications. And Jessica Fletcher is the worst offender, which is the reason she is our page image here.\nThis only covers cases where there is an actual mystery (i.e crime mystery), with a mundane solution.

{"PirateKing": "Exactly What It Says on the Tin; someone (not always male) who is identified or referred to as the top criminal. Be they Desert Bandits, Pirates on the high seas, Outlaws on the frontier, etc.\nOf course, the idea of criminals forming a monarchical government doesn't really make very much sense. Yet the trope still persists and shows no signs of becoming discredited. This is probably a result of the Rule of Cool.\nThe King of Thieves doesn't have to be a part of true monarchy or kingship. They might have reached their position through Klingon Promotion as a result of their hard work and/or ruthlessness. Or it might just be a title they get for being the strongest around. They may actually command the loyalty of either all of the pirates on the seas, or another type of Thieves' Guild, or they may simply be the captain of a single notorious pirate ship or some some other small group of outlaws who prefers an impressive-sounding title.\nCan overlap with Elective Monarchy.

{"XMarksTheHero": "Probably the most iconic and distinctive form of a Good Scar, this scar consists of two clean, intersecting cuts that form a cross or X on the hero's face. Generally, it serves to imply that the hero has been through quite a few skirmishes while making them look badass.\nHow the hero got such a scar is usually not explained. Part of our brain tells us that getting such a scar in battle is highly unlikely, if not impossible, unless they're deliberately inflicted, such as in torture. Another common possibility, rarely addressed, is that the two scars which form the X had been inflicted in different instances.\n"}
{"HighTurnOverRate": "There's a job opening, and the position looks very desirable, at least on paper. But it's hard. So hard, that no one lasts long. Many quit before the day is over. Many quit without waiting to take the money. Many quit while screaming, without looking where they were going as they fled, and were only seen again muttering about \"Twenty bucks an hour\" over and over and over again. In some cases, they never even got a chance to quit, and instead died in a suspicious accident or, in especially dangerous jobs (such as \"The Sheriff of a lawless Wild West town\"), the line of duty.\nIn some cases, the difficulty isn't with the job itself, but with the viciousness and/or stupidity of the boss. This may cause the character to be fired or even killed for failing to satisfy the boss' unreasonable demands.\nUsually the \"no one can hack it\" circumstances are shown by a montage of characters of different types attempting the task before leaving. Some of these may be Shout Outs to recognisable characters who would be good at the task in hand... but not quite good enough.\nThis is commonly used for nannies, teachers or babysitters to unruly children, to show how horrible the children are. Alternatively, it's the secretary to an utterly unreasonable boss. This is a common set up (or sometimes reveal) for a New Job Episode, showing the previous failures at the task, warning the characters of the horror they face.\nAs a rule, if the new employee is not a main character, we'll see how the job is so horrible, and even this \"hard to crack\" character will eventually fail to the nightmare that is the task.\nBut if the new employee is a major character, they'll be a little bit different. Perhaps they have a warm heart and honest demeanour that will soften the hardest heart. Or perhaps she'll be the first to turn around and tear their Pointy-Haired Boss down as vengeance for all the previous employees.\n"}
{"TranslationPunctuation": "Some authors address this by using punctuation other than quote marks to indicate that characters are speaking a different language that is being dubbed as English. The various types of brackets are a frequent choice here (angle quotes \u2039 \u203a, angle brackets \u27e8 \u27e9, or inequality marks < > are particularly common). Other options include using unusual formatting or all lowercase letters. It should be noted that many real-world languages use angled brackets and hook brackets rather than the English single or double quotes around dialogue in written works.\nA word of caution to editors of this page: Be careful with your own formatting as some forms may be interpreted by TV Tropes as wiki markup rather than text. To be on the safe side, you may want to wrap quotations in the [= =] markup to prevent this.\nA form of Painting the Medium.

{"PanderingToTheBase": "One of life's little oddities is the nebulous relationship between the fans of media and the creators, producers, and distributors of that media. In theory, the creators call the shots; they decide what's happening and the fans follow as they will. But that's a bit naive; it's the fans who keep the ratings up, the sales high and the money flowing in, and if you displease them, they can just go elsewhere and take the gravy train with them. The existence of things like Fanon Discontinuity, Dork Age, Author's Saving Throw and Fanon means that any property successful enough to cultivate a group of intensely devoted fans is going to be at least partially concerned with satisfying their wishes; to some degree at least, you have to give your viewers what they want.\nSo, just give the fans exactly what they want and everything will work out. Simple, huh?\nNot quite. Generally speaking, the more intensely devoted fans in a fandom are usually outnumbered by the casual fans, but the more devoted a fan becomes, the more active (and louder) they become in the fandom. So while a few million casual fans might enjoy an episode without ever making it widely known, a handful of devoted and occasionally unhinged fans are screaming on a web forum about how the show is now Ruined FOREVER, which can be seen and heard by everyone... including the people making the show. The producers may then start pandering to these voices exclusively, believing them to be the voice of everyone watching (which they will often claim to be) \u2014 but \"everyone\" in this case may in fact consist only of a handful of people, and what this minority wants and what the other, less noisy fans want can differ drastically.\nThis presents a major problem. The property can end up becoming a private club, accessible only to a select few. Excluding the casual fans means they'll simply drift away to find something else to spend their time on, and raising the entry bar too high means you run the risk of locking out new fans who may have possibly been interested in the property, but now find it too difficult to access. While the vocal minority might now be satisfied (and you can't even count on that), they rarely translate to enough ratings and / or sales to justify the property's continued existence \u2014 and to make matters worse, even this hardcore minority may begin to drift away for numerous reasons (changing tastes, burnout, lessened interest, etc). This results in diminishing returns ending in eventual cancellation if unchecked.\nFurthermore, the overall quality of the property can begin to suffer; just because someone is intensely committed to a particular work of fiction doesn't necessarily mean they know what makes good fiction work. The hardcore fans are generally fascinated by the backstory, trivia and continuity which can build up around a franchise, but this doesn't necessarily make riveting entertainment to anyone less interested in all of this stuff. And if you somehow get the story's continuity hopelessly tangled up or make any mistakes, this makes things worse; not only have you lost the interest of the people who don't care about this stuff, you've annoyed the people who do, and it's now guaranteed they won't be shy about saying so. In many cases, pandering to the base rarely succeeds in making anyone happy, not even the fans it's supposed to win over, because ultimately what most devoted fans want is the same as the casual ones; interesting and engaging stories, not just constant pandering.\nA wise producer understands a simple rule that helps them avoid all of this; generally speaking, you've got the hardcore minority regardless \u2014 they'll usually (but not always) keep following the story, even if they're dragged in kicking and screaming. You need to win over the undecided. They understand that for every fan who writes a frothing invective on the Internet or a rabid email, there's probably ten or more who are perfectly content with what's happening.\nOn the flip side, however, tropes are not bad; pandering to the base can and indeed in many cases does work out just fine. Sometimes giving the fans what they want is the same as giving the wider audience what they want as well. And while they can at times be annoying, the fans are still part of your audience, and if you're deliberately pissing them off, you're still pissing off a potentially significant segment of your own audience, who will desert you if you go too far; make them angry enough, and they may become loud enough to scare away more casual fans or potential new fans. Furthermore, relying on the approval of the silent majority over the noisy fans presents its own pitfalls \u2014 in particular, you might not actually have it. The fan criticism you're receiving may have a point.\nCompare Vocal Minority, which usually is the bases being pandered to. Sometimes the base in question is the Lowest Common Denominator. Can result in The Chris Carter Effect, Better on DVD, Continuity Lock-Out, Continuity Porn. Compare/contrast Running the Asylum, which is sometimes the writers pandering to the fans, and sometimes pandering to themselves. Can also result to fans screaming Ruined Forever as well as an Unpleasable Fanbase. When the pandering actually does work, it's And the Fandom Rejoiced.\nThis phenomenon is sometimes called \"fanservice\", but don't confuse this with our definition of said trope (although the two can often be related, depending on what exactly the fanbase being pandered to is demanding).\nNot to be confused with Panda-ing to the Audience; this trope has nothing to do with pandas.\n"}
{"TeasingTheSubstituteTeacher": "Substitute teachers in fiction have it bad. On top of having to deal with a class you are unfamiliar with, they also seem to be the butt of their jokes.

Bob may want Alice around in case he's On the Rebound. Bob may have an Unrequited Love Switcheroo that turns out to be false once Alice agrees to be with him. Or maybe Bob's the Master of the Mixed Message, so being friends makes it hard for Alice to move on.\nFor whatever reason, this will lead Alice to demand Bob love her or leave her alone.

{"OneEpisodeWonder": "There are two types of shows that last for a single episode \u2014 the ones that are immediately canned, and those that never get picked up in the first place.\nThe former category should be easy to explain \u2014 if a show gets extremely negative reviews, poor ratings, or contains controversial content without enough redeeming value to be worth dealing with the media watchdogs, it's likely it'll die a quick death without anyone caring. The most it might get is a sense of confusion that anyone thought the idea would work in the first place.\nHowever, the second is intriguing \u2014 television pilots that never got sold into a full series.

{"PlayerCharacter": "This concept represents the in-game character controlled by the player\u2014as opposed to Non Player Characters who aren't. Typically the game puts you in charge of at least one entity, but the extent to which that entity is an actual character, as opposed to being a Featureless Protagonist or Non-Entity General, depends on the genre, the game, the game's developers, and even (if Character Customization is available) the player him- or herself. Our page on Player and Protagonist Integration has more details on the different points along the scale that are possible here.\nSometimes, the term PC only refers to The Protagonist, particularly if they are created by the player, while NPC is used even for other party members who the player still controls but are preexisting characters within the game world, rather than a personal avatar. For more information on possible PC/NPC party configurations, see Player Character Calculus.\nIt's a curious thing, but most PCs in tabletop RPGs have a sort of personality archetype that applies regardless of the genre of the game the PCs are in or the personalities of the people playing them.

{"DubInducedPlothole": "So you're translating and/or adapting an ongoing story from another country, and for whatever reason \u2013 maybe your boss ordered you to tone things down to appease Moral Guardians or commercial sponsors, or etc. \u2013 you've made significant changes to the original content. But then additional material from the original source comes in, and there's something in there that just doesn't work with the alterations you've already made (in a worst-case scenario, the new material explicitly contradicts your changes); maybe it's a Japan-centred story where a change in honorifics occurs but you cut them all out for ease of flow\u2020\u00a0 (admittedly, a good translator shouldn't have to employ honorifics regardless; they can simply indicate a change in relationship through the tone of dialogue), or a character whose death you censored has to come Back from the Dead, or you excised content that later turns out to have had a major impact on the story's plot.\nWhat do you do? Well, there are three options. The first is to ignore changes in the source and just keep adapting the story as you always have, hoping that the series won't collapse under the weight of its own contradictions; this is high-risk because there is a point where no amount of editing or rewriting can change what's in front of you. The second option is to try and explain the discrepancies away using the best leaps of logic and (if applicable) technobabble you can, which runs the risk of making your viewers aware of the changes (which is never a good thing). The third option is to just completely blow it off! Just pretend the last change you made never happened and adapt the source as-is. So what if you just took a two by four to the plot? Who cares if your dialogue doesn't make any sense? Send that script out the door, and let the fans deal with it. If you even assume that the fans are smart enough, particularly given their age, to notice.\nYes, sometimes the guys working on a script, having written themselves into a corner, will completely blow off the changes they already made and start adapting something completely literally, even if the resulting script makes no sense, even in the context of itself. Sometimes they'll even adapt a cultural custom with zero explanation \u2013 and nobody in the show will act surprised. The resulting disconnect creates a big giant plot hole and the only recourse of the fan is to just look up the original version, or just ignore it themselves.\nThis trope is specifically for localization of a work in its own medium. If this is caused through adaptation of a work to a different medium, it's an Adaptation-Induced Plot Hole.\nCompare Inconsistent Dub, when something in a translation keeps zigzagging between two different changes and/or between changes and the original because the translators don't keep things straight; this happens mostly with names or pronunciations, but can happen with plot points, where it would overlap with this trope.\n"}
{"PlatformHell": "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a plumber jumping into an invisible coin block and falling to his death... repeatedly... forever.\nVideo game protagonists often have bad days. It's not uncommon to have to Double Jump between Floating Platforms over spiked pits, dash between three sets of synchronized fire vents, then bounce off a flying enemy to hit an item block, all while dodging those Goddamned Bats and Demonic Spiders. It may be fiendishly difficult, but it's still par for the course.\nBut not like this. Not like this.\nThe first item block? Falls and crushes you when you hit it! The pit spikes? Shoot freaking lasers that slice you to bits when you jump over them! The safe platform at the other end? Suddenly tilts sideways for no reason at all! The harmless bush you just walked past? Grows teeth and bites your head off! The tiny white cloud that you thought was part of the background? Just blasted you with lightning! The secret Warp Zone you found? Sends you back to the first level of the game!\nAnd when you finally, finally get that precious Super Mushroom? Makes you grow so monstrously huge that the floor cracks in half and you plunge into the center of the Earth.\nMight we be the first to say...welcome to Hell. Platform Hell.\nThis isn't Nintendo Hard; it's just sadistic. Every platform has booby-trapped spikes. Every empty hallway has a wall of cannons waiting just offscreen. Most of the power-ups will kill you or impede your progress, but every power-up that doesn't is absolutely necessary for survival. The Kaizo Trap isn't a nasty surprise, it's an inevitability. And when you think you've figured out the twisted mind of the game designer, something incomparably worse gets thrown at you. The entire experience is a humongous, hilariously sadistic Kafkaesque Parody of a Darker and Edgier Nintendo Hard video game.\nAs a rule of thumb, a Platform Hell game should meet several of the following criteria:\nTypical \"traps\" in these games include:\nThey will also usually go by names that outright suggest the cruel difficulty and trickery contained within, usually with names based on 'hard', 'impossible', 'difficult' and 'unfair'.\nFor obvious reasons, very few commercial companies would dare release a game like this. Hence, this variety of videogame is almost entirely the domain of ROM Hacks and homebrew. Romhacks especially are made for game emulators, fully expecting and taking advantage of the fact that players will be Save Scumming.\nAlso known as \"Masocore\", after this blog postnote\u00a0Although, the term \"masocore\" is subtly broader - referring simply to \"player death as narrative technique\". cactus's Psychosomnium, for instance, is masocore but not Platform Hell in the least. This should not be confused with very Nintendo Hard games like Jumper, N, and Battletoads, which, while being immensely difficult, play (mostly) fair and straight. A Platform Hell game is intentionally unfair by design, and plays that unfair Fake Difficulty as a sort of slapstick humor in which the audience, or rather, the player, is the comedic victim.\nIt should also not be confused with masochism-themed games like Mighty Jill Off, which are more homage than parody.\nThey're also sometimes known as 'Kaizo' hacks after Kaizo Mario World, as well as 'Pit' hacks (if they're so difficult as to be impossible with normal human reflexes).\nThe Trope Maker is Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels (the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2), which intentionally screwed with all the tropes of the previous entries: Warp Zones that returned you to already completed worlds, land-based enemies now appearing in the water and underwater enemies floating in the air, springs that bounce Mario far beyond the top of the screen, winds that play hell with your momentum, invisible power-up blocks to be hit as you attempt to make a jump and, of course, the Poison Mushroom, often dispensed by hitting a block only reached by a crazy difficult series of jumps.

{"WhatsASecretFour": "One way of building background is to have the characters refer to things without explaining exactly what those things are. The slight confusion caused is balanced by the sense given of a larger world, outside the plot. If a story is extended to a long enough series (especially when there's a high turnover of writers), most of these cryptic references are explained and/or used as Canon Fodder, but often one or two will never appear in story. What such references really mean is a favorite subject for fan-clubs. The rise of the web has reduced the incidence of such things (creators get asked), though not totally eliminated them.\nCompare to the closely-related Noodle Incident, Canon Fodder, Narrative Filigree, What Happened to the Mouse? and Mysterious Past.

{"Yokai": "Youkai/Y\u014dkai (also known as \"Yaoguai\" in Chinese pinyin since the term originated from that language) are a widely-varied collection of various supernatural creatures that pop up in Shinto religion. They have a lot in common with The Fair Folk. Some youkai are good, others are evil, and many are different. Some are mischievous, others avoid humans entirely. Shinto is an animist religion, and youkai are often associated with natural features such as forests and mountains. This word is often translated as \"demon\" in Western translations, but since that term is generally associated with pure evil, that does not adequately describe the creatures in question \u2014 they are more like The Fair Folk, spanning the entire moral range between good, mischievous, neutral, and actually evil. The closest true Western equivalent is probably that of the ancient Roman genii or spirits.\nSupernatural creatures drawn from Western sources often turn out to seem more like youkai in Japanese works. For instance, vampires.note\u00a0See the section on oni below. In the West you've got Nosferatu \u2014 a grotesque, undead monster who burns in sunlight and murders to preserve his hideous unlife. In Japan you've got exceptionally cute Fanservice protagonist Moka Akashiya, who is not undead, harbors no ill-will towards the sun, and drinks tiny amounts of blood that leave her \"victim\" light-headed at worst, but who has a Superpowered Evil Side who can (and will if you look at her the wrong way) kick your ass thoroughly.\nHenge, a subset of youkai, are magical animals with Shapeshifting powers and human intelligence. They often assume human form and get into all kinds of mischief. Kinds of henge include Kitsune, Tanuki, and Nekomata.\nObake is another Japanese word that can indicate some type of monster. Derived from the word for \u201cto change\u201d, it generally covers the subset of youkai that includes shapeshifting animals (hence the terms bake-gitsune, bake-neko, etc.) as well as Animate Inanimate Objects. Confusingly, however, the word obake can also be used to refer to ghosts, also known as yuurei. See Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl for more information.\nAyakashi is a word which is roughly synonymous with \"youkai\" in current day usage, though traditionally it referred to a ghost that appears at sea during a shipwreck.\nMany types of youkai were codified during the Edo period in the works of Toriyama Sekien. The genre of manga that deals with Youkai was founded by Shigeru Mizuki (1922\u20142015), who was obsessed with Youkai ever since he was a child. The Trope Codifier of modern youkai manga is his ever-popular GeGeGe no Kitar\u014d that has received an anime adaption at least once a decade since it was written.\nThe list presented below is by no means complete. Many types of Youkai are exceedingly rare to find in modern media and so are not included. On the other hand, some have garnered enough examples to warrant their own pages.\nYoukai with their own pages:\nNekomata: A seemingly ordinary cat that develops magical nature through long life. It looks like an ordinary house cat except for the tail, which splits into two at half-length. While much smarter than it used to be, a nekomata remains just as whimsical, which may be dangerous with its new-found powers of illusion and necromancy. It's said a cat will become a nekomata after turning 100 years old, where upon its tail splits, it starts using human speech, somehow gains transformation powers, a greater intelligence, and other odd abilities. The name is often used and confused for catgirls. May be a Mega Neko.\nA more general term for cat youkai is bakeneko, but almost all modern depictions of bakeneko will at least allude to the nekomata's signature split tail.\nThe Kasha, a mysterious grave-robbing youkai, is usually depicted as a nekomata Wreathed in Flames (specifically Hellfire).\nTsukumogami: Inanimate objects that come to life after a hundred years. These can range from weapons to clothes to umbrellas. Well-known traditional examples include karakasa (paper umbrellas), ittan-momen (a floating strip of cotton cloth), biwa-bokuboku and koto-furunushi (stringed musical instruments) and burabura (lanterns). Strangely, they avoid electrical energy in common folklore from the 1940s and it is said that no modern object could ever become a Tsukumogami.\nBaku: A relatively benign example, being a creature with an elephant-like head that eats bad dreams. In modern Japanese the word baku can also refer to tapirs \u2014 when introduced to Japan, they bore such an uncanny resemblance to the mythological baku that they were assumed to be the same thing, and heavily influenced its later depictions. No relation to the capital of Azerbaijan.\nKamaitachi: Weasel-like creatures that attack in trios: the first one knocks down a traveler with a gust of wind, the second cuts the traveler with its sickle-like claws (literally sickles or curved blades, in some depictions), and the third applies an ointment that stops the bleeding, leaving the victim with bloodless but inexplicably large and painful wounds. They're essentially the personification of the pain felt during a bitterly cold wind.\nTsuchinoko: A snakelike creature with a fat body. It's mostly harmless to people, unless awoken from its sleep \u2014 in that case, its venom can fell a man instantly. Very swift and acrobatic, and occasionally said to be a compulsive liar with a fondness for alcohol. Has a similar status in Japan to Bigfoot in America.\nRokurokubi and Nukekubi: These two creatures are humanoid monsters, usually but not always female; the Rokurokubi are human by day but have extremely elastic necks during the night, while Nukekubi can detach their heads from their necks and float away in search of human flesh and blood, as well as vermin and lamp oil. In some depictions rokurokubi aren't a true species, but the Partial Transformation form of a snake youkai. Sometimes enter Ambiguously Human territory, being treated as humans afflicted by a strange curse or medical condition.\nTsuchigumo and Jorougumo: These spiders are monstrous in size (as big or bigger than a man) that can take human form to eat travelers. Jorougumo uses a lure to attract travelers to feed her offspring, and often has the power to allure men with a song. Others act as a Shapeshifting Lover. Tsuchigumo can also use illusions to keep his webs hidden and make people ill in order to feed on them.\nIn modern Japanese, \"otsuchigumo\" also refers to tarantulas, and \"jorougumo\" to the golden orb-weaver spider.\nRaiju or \"Thunder Beast\" is lightning in a weasel-like shape: it's usually represented with many tails and/or legs, poisonous claws, and bright yellow and black fur. They can also appear as dogs, monkeys, tanuki, foxes, or even balls of fire and lightning. Raijous were sometimes associated with the similarly-named Raijin, the Shinto god of thunder and storms.\nNyuudou: Youkai that look like buddhist monks, commonly encountered on roads. They existed in many different varieties and were one of the favorite forms for youkai possessing Voluntary Shapeshifting powers to assume.\nMikoshi-nyuudou, Miage-nyuudou and Nyuudou-bouzu are short monks who would grow taller as one looked at him until either one's neck was completely exposed from looking up at the nyuudou, at which point it would cut off one's head, or one fell backwards from trying to see how tall the nyuudou became, at which point it would laugh at you and disappear. Hitotsume-nyuudou are, just as their name indicates, one-eyed, cyloptic nyuudou.\nWanyuudou: A burning wheel, frequently with a man's/monk's face serving as the hubcaps. This bizarre entity is flies about at night in search of humans to slaughter on sight and kidnap their souls. Often lumped with the Buer from the Ars Goetia.\nInugami and Okami: Dog and wolf gods. Usually malevolent, and often found serving as Familiars.\nThe okuri-inu and okuri-okami tend more towards Noble Wolf, following travellers and protecting them from harm. However, they have a tendency to attack people who mistreat or offend them... or sometimes just those who show too much weakness; as a result, \"okuri-okami\" has become an idiom referring to stalkers and Wolves in Sheep's Clothing.\nUshi-Oni or Gyuuki: Meaning \"bull fiend\", this is a sort of counterpart to the minotaur. In some stories it's a demonic looking ox with many tails and claws, in others he's a sort of giant spider, while in others is a sort of wisp fire. Frequently seen with a half-women, half-snake youkai called Nure-onna, and reputed to be mates with her.\nNuppeppo: A fleshy blob creature that lumbers around in deserted places, mainly temples and graveyards. Has a smell comparable to that of rotting flesh, leading some to believe they are made of corpses. In spite of this, Nuppeppo are generally peaceful creatures.\nGashadokuro: A giant skeleton, it is born from the bodies of those who died without proper burial (usually from plague, famine, or war). They stand 15 times taller than a normal person and come out after midnight to drink the blood of whoever they can snatch up. Their approach is heralded by the rattling of bones (hence the name, which means \"rattling skull\" in Japanese), and their only weakness is a purifying ward. They are otherwise indestructible and sometimes can turn invisible.\n"}
{"DescendFromAHigherPlaneOfExistence": "A superpowered character (generally a very powerful one) loses their powers for a permanent or extended period of time.\nThis isn't just a case of Brought Down to Normal which inevitably ends, but a much longer lasting if not permanent reduction in strength. This is often done as a long term Drama-Preserving Handicap on the character in order to keep them in the cast without having to write them off or use really convoluted Green Rocks and Kryptonite Factor plots. (This may be accomplished by a Power Nullifier.)\nIt's unlikely the character will be pleased by this turn of events, and if they're power hungry or evil they'll fight tooth and nail to find a way to get it back. Heroes who just want to be normal will be happy, even if it means they can no longer use their finger-snapping problem solving powers.\nThis trope mostly applies to characters who are already gods, godlike, or mortals who through the story gain powers to rival the gods. The result is usually a God in Human Form. Expect them to learn that Power Loss Makes You Strong.\nThis isn't just a simple Failure Is the Only Option or Status Quo Is God, where a character who gains godlike powers has them gone in the same episode, but the writers trying jump out of the corner they've painted themselves into by depowering the character who by all indications should/could have kept all their powers throughout the show.\nIf this happened because the character was transported to another dimension, it's because Your Magic's No Good Here. Subtrope of Brought Down to Normal. See also How to Stop the Deus ex Machina and Field Power Effect.\n"}
{"Moll": "Every sufficiently decadent Casanova, criminal and villain will have at least one scantily clad floozy to serve as eye candy, fetch drinks, and slink around seductively. If the villain is sufficiently well-funded, they may have an entire harem. This applies to female villains too, with bare chested male mooks at her beck and call.\nAs the picture illustrates, the \"sultan\" in this harem also has a habit of dressing the floozies in a thematically appropriate manner that coincides with their job or even criminal theme. Not surprisingly, their employer doesn't have any real affection or attachment to the harem, and will disrespect or mistreat them; sometimes dumping them on the ground when hearing bad news, ordering the floozy out when he talks shop, or outright using them as human shields/distractions in a firefight.\nAnd of course, the paid for harem will have only nominal loyalty to their \"sultan\", being either extremely frisky with the hero or disappearing at the drop of a hat. It's a rare floozy that \"stands by her man.\" The exception is if their employer specifically hires opposite gender bodyguards or domestic servants who just happen to be gorgeous and has them pose as eye candy.\nMight be found in the Den of Iniquity during off-duty hours. Compare Ignored Enamored Underling. Also compare Royal Harem, where the relationship is more institutional than paid. See also I Have You Now, My Pretty and Go-Go Enslavement, where the villain tries to press a heroic lady into the harem. A Gold Digger on the other hand may see this as a viable lifestyle choice, making the villain a Sugar Daddy.\nTruth in Television, this is probably a Real Life trope that has been stylized in TV.\n"}
{"NoOffButton": "Perhaps it's some sort of Doomsday Device or an Artifact of Doom maybe it runs on some sort of perpetual energy. Possibly there are actually two phlebotinum devices interacting with each other and destroying the world, but if you turn off one device the other one will grow strong enough to kill everyone on earth anyway. Perhaps it's a Clingy MacGuffin or Clingy Costume and it's draining your life force, but if you remove it you'll blow up. No Off Button is simply the reason a particular piece of dangerous Applied Phlebotinum can't be turned off or destroyed, such as it lacking an off button.\nFailsafe Failure is closely related, and involves examples where there is an \"off button\" or other form of Override Command in place, but it doesn't work.\n"}
{"CantStandThemCantLiveWithoutThem": "A development often used in buddy films and romantic comedy. One person, often a loner-type, is paired off with someone else against his/her will.\nThey can't stand the person/situation and wishes for his old routine. When he gets his old routine back, they suddenly realizes they miss that person a lot and does everything in their power to get her back. Usually, happens when a bickering pair become Vitriolic Best Buds, or generate an Aww, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other situation, whether it's a fraternal sort of love among buddies, or romantic love.\nSometimes subverted to \"Can't live with 'em, can't kill 'em\".\nSee also Odd Couple.\nCompare We Want Our Jerk Back (when the resident Deadpan Snarker's presence is sorely missed), Belligerent Sexual Tension.\n"}
{"DiseasePreventionAesop": "Many works and installments of works have some sort of moral. This is the trope for when the moral is about preventing disease (both lessons on preventing getting sick and preventing getting others sick qualify, and the two often overlap) and is very common in children's entertainment. Usually it's about diseases in general, but sometimes, they focus on one particular disease.\nThe lesson may teach about one, two, several, or all of these things: hand-washing (often with an instruction on singing Happy Birthday to You! twice or washing for twenty seconds and instructions on when to wash hands, sometimes giving reasonable advice and sometimes giving advice that borders on Neat Freak tendencies), vaccinations, checkups (these two might have an added message of \"Don't be Afraid of Needles or Afraid of Doctors\"), covering one's mouth and/or nose while coughing and/or sneezing (which is less important if you're not sick, but often the viewers and characters are taught to do it anyway, because it's become an etiquette thing; they might also teach people to cough/sneeze specifically into their elbows), not eating off the ground, not sharing drinks, staying home when sick, and cleaning items that might have germs on. They might also give outdated advice like \"Don't go outside in the cold/rain without proper clothes/with wet hair/at all\". It might also talk about nutrition, bathing, keeping fit, dental hygiene, and/or getting enough sleep, but a message about any of these is not a Disease Prevention Aesop unless disease prevention is explicitly mentioned.\nIn a way, this could be an attempt to defy the Sick Episode trope, although these tropes can overlap: it might start with a sick character and another character will come and one (or occasionally a combination) of three things will generally happen:\n1.) The arriving character will give the sick character Tough Love and say, \"You could have avoided this.\" while explaining how.\n2.) The arriving character will teach the sick character how to prevent their friends from getting sick.\n3.) The arriving character will teach the character's healthy friends how to avoid getting sick.\nOften, these messages tend to be rather blatant, with characters telling the audience what to do and/or very specific superheroes that seem to only exist to deliver these messages. It might also try and make these instructions seem cool, often by saying things like \"even Superman washes his hands\".\nIt may also have an explanation of what germs are, but the only real information these Aesops tend to give about germs is that they're too small to see, they can get inside us and make us sick, they are on dirty things and not on clean things, they are common, and occasionally that there are types called bacteria and viruses and that \"some germs are good\". It might portray germs as sentient, grotesque, and deliberately wanting to make humans ill, sometimes to Take Over the World or just because. The immune system might be explained, but generally not further than it needs to be kept strong, it gets rid of germs, and (if we're lucky) that it involves things called white blood cells. It may sometimes be depicted as soldiers.\nThis trope may overlap with Very Special Episode especially if the episode focuses on a particular, serious disease or the TV show/book series the installment belongs to does not normally teach Aesops. It can also overlap with Sneeze of Doom if the lesson (or one of the lessons) is covering the nose/mouth when sneezing: leaving a sneeze uncovered might cause highly unlikely and chaotic consequences as both a comedy device and a scare tactic.\n"}
{"UninhibitedMusclePower": "Some characters are strong. In many works, this can easily be justified - either superpowers are known to exist, or Charles Atlas Superpower is a fact of life. But in some settings, the author needs a more down-to-earth explanation for why one guy can throw cars around like they're made of tissue paper. When someone is called upon for said explanation, the following lecture will usually occur:\n\"You ever hear about moms lifting cars off their kids? The human body is actually capable of incredible strength, but the brain inhibits it most of the time in order to keep our muscles from tearing themselves apart under the strain. His body is doing the same thing, but he's in that state of strength all the time.\"\nEssentially, this is Explosive Overclocking applied to human beings who lack the Required Secondary Powers to handle it. This can be used as a Hand Wave or Played for Drama; in the latter case, expect the danger of a Heroic RRoD resulting from overuse of this strength to be heavily played up.\nThe principle behind this is Truth in Television, but the idea of these inhibitors being permanently turned off or granting anything that could be considered true Super Strength is most emphatically not. And if you could do that, it wouldn't take long to do serious damage to your body. Compare 90% of Your Brain, where powers activate the unused brain potential instead of unused muscle potential.\nCompare Die or Fly.\n"}
{"SNKBoss": "An SNK Boss is an AI opponent in a Fighting Game who breaks the rules that enforce Competitive Balance to such an absurd degree that they are considered to be vastly superior to every other character in the game. The SNK Boss combines Nintendo Hard with The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard and takes them Up to Eleven. Powers may include:\nIf the boss is playable, such as upon defeat, they are significantly weaker and more balanced for actual play. A non-weakened playable SNK Boss is most certainly banned in any competitive tournaments where it would be a Game-Breaker for one human player to use on another.\nIn some fighting games, the Final Boss is a unique opponent in both design and ability (such as a 30-foot Eldritch Abomination) that is Purposely Overpowered and only appears in single-player/non-competitive game modes; it's slightly more sensible that such a boss would have those high-powered attacks rather than a human-sized villain. It can also feel pretty good for a player who manages to use an otherwise-mortal badass to beat the crap out of a godlike monster.\nThese bosses originate from the days of arcade machines, where the high difficulty level was used to separate players from their pocket change while attempting to register their initials in the top spot of the machine's High Scores table. In console games, side effects of continued exposure to an SNK Boss may include broken controllers and increased sales of GameSharks to \"cheat back\". Occasionally, these bosses may have an Achilles' Heel that utilizes special moves from characters that usually have limited utility. It is unknown whether these are intentional or not.\nIs there an upside to this? Gameplay and Story Integration. Given that characters of this kind are frequently talked up in the story as being terrifying and powerful, if they fall into this category then at least the player doesn't feel like all the hype and drama was over nothing.\nTakes its name from the company SNK, which seems to love making bosses like this and having each successive one top the last. This is also a case of Follow the Leader, especially with Arc System Works.\nSubtrope of Fake Difficulty and The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard. See also Perfect-Play A.I., whose difficulty arises less from outright cheating, and more from a flawless battle strategy. Do not confuse with That One Boss, which describes a difficult boss as declared by a majority and technically fights on a much fairer level when compared to this trope.\nWhile this trope primarily applies to fighting games, it can also apply to non-fighting games, provided they are similarly competitive and have similar ways of ensuring Competitive Balance. A Racing game, for example, may have a champion with an absurdly tricked out car and a knowledge of the track that combine to give it an advantage no mater which vehicle/racer you choose. If a game is non-competitive, such as platformers, RPG's, etc., bosses are not considered SNK bosses no matter how unfair they are. There are other tropes for that.\nSee also Easy Levels, Hard Bosses. Don't be surprised if they can only be toppled via Not the Intended Use, chiefly AI Breakers.\n"}
{"CombatReferee": "When some authority or power dictates what counts as \"fighting fair\" and actively enforces these rules on the battlefield. Almost always a neutral party in regards to the fighting itself, they exist solely to make sure the rules of battle are followed and punish those who break them. Their presence is often justified \u2014 if the fighting in question is a Tournament or Blood Sport, for example \u2014 but they'll just as easily show up in real battle-to-the-death combat, in which case their presence may cause large amounts of Fridge Logic. Liberal application of the MST3K Mantra is recommended. Expect an evil or ruthless character to attack the Combat Referee at some point; this may result in the heroes being forced into a no-rules grudge match, or it may prompt the referee to deal with his attackers himself via overwhelming force.\n"}
{"BecauseImJonesy": "When an imposter is spotted because the person he's impersonating is in the group/room with, or is himself, the person they're trying to deceive.\nIf you have a good enough disguise, you might still be able to get away with bumping into the person you're impersonating if you convince them that you are actually their reflection in a mirror, or if you are really lucky, find out that your disguise is a uniform within regulation. A particularly audacious infiltrator might respond by accusing the person they're disguised as of being the imposter. Those liable to Poser Hating are also generally vulnerable to this. This is the key risk run by anyone executing a Janitor Impersonation Infiltration.\nA variation that occasionally appears in superhero stories is for the hero to encounter someone impersonating his Secret Identity.\nCompare I Am One of Those, Too, I Am Spartacus.\nNot to be confused with Actually, I Am Him.\n"}
{"GreenEyedRedhead": "Green-eyed redheads are possibly the rarest color combination found in humanity (with the exception of some abnormalities), making a character with this combination highly conspicuous. The fact that red and green are complementary colors also makes for a visually striking appearance. Therefore, this trope is used as an easy way to distinguish an important, notable character visually.\nIt's more often applied to women than it is to men, and is almost always either found as a trait of the hero or the hero's Love Interest. They're likely to be a Fiery Redhead as Green Eyes often connote a similar kind of personality. If Elemental Powers apply, they're probably Playing with Fire. To qualify for this trope, it's important that:\nThis trope might have been influenced a lot by Maureen O'Hara and her various roles, which also cemented this as the Phenotype Stereotype for an Irish person.\n"}
{"BigSHUTUP": "When you don't have anything smarter to say. Basically, someone screams \"Shut up!\" at another person (or group of people) when annoyed, upset, or pissed off. Could also be uttered when trying to put a Super-Powered Evil Side in its place. Variations include: \"SHUT THE HELL UP!\", \"QUIET!\", \"SHUT YOUR MOUTH / FACE!\", \"SILENCE!\", \"ENOUGH!\", etc. The Japanese version, very common, is \"URUSAI!\", literally \"noisy!\" Occasionally applied literally to Shut Up, Hannibal! or Shut Up, Kirk!. \"Shut Up!\" Gunshot is this when it's done with firearms.\nCompare Silence, You Fool!, Ceiling Banger, Noisy Shut-Up, Rapid-Fire \"Shut Up!\", and\u2013 SHUT UP!!\n"}
{"ElementalPunch": "Some people fight with their fists; to them, there's nothing more gratifying than pummeling foes left and right. Other people prefer burning their target with fire; perhaps they just just love that smell of napalm in the morning.\nBut why not combine them?: After all, a punch hurts. Fire hurts. A punch on fire is bound to hurt twice as much as either of the two individually. And thus, the art of combining Elemental Powers with close-quarter combat was born.\nThe Elemental Punch is a melee attack that has an elemental or energy-based upgrade. These come in quite a few flavors:\nOf course, punches are not the only attacks that can be elementally empowered. Elemental kicks are almost as, if not just as, common. Channeling elements into weapons happens quite a bit, if the Flaming Sword and Laser Blade are any indication. And, of course, there's nothing quite like pummeling the enemy with a flying, full-body tackle whilst encased in one's element of choice.\nThis is a tactic that comes naturally to the Magic Knight and the Supernatural Martial Artist, and, understandably, usually requires Full-Contact Magic. In Video Games, this trope is often employed to prevent non-magical fighters from being excluded from Elemental Rock\u2013Paper\u2013Scissors. This may be seen as a Yin-Yang Bomb, combining matter with energy. Compare the Trick Arrow, the archer's answer to the Elemental Punch. See also Swiss Army Appendage, Blasting Time, Item Amplifier and Power Fist.\n"}
{"PhlebotiNum": "Phlebotinumnote\u00a0or \"phlebotinium\" in the Commonwealth countries is the versatile substance that may be rubbed on anything to cause an effect needed by a plot. Examples include but are not limited to: nanotechnology, magic crystal emanations, pixie dust, and Green Rocks.\n\nIn essence, it is plot fuel. Without it, the story would grind to an abrupt halt. It's the science that powers the FTL drive on the starship so the characters can get somewhere, it's the magic that hatches the Egg MacGuffin so the protagonist can save an endangered species, it's the strange things unknown to science or magic that do basically anything except those limits and dangers required by the plot. The reader does not know how Phlebotinum would work and the creators hope nobody cares.\nAccording to Joss Whedon, during the DVD commentary for the pilot episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the term \"phlebotinum\" originates from Buffy writer (and Angel co-creator) David Greenwalt's sudden outburst: \"Don't touch the phlebotinum!\" apropos of nothing.Fun Fact\u00a0Whether or not he had the etymological connection in mind, \"phlebotomy\" is the drawing of blood, coincidentally appropriate in context.\nIf the phlebotinum in question is simply a physical substance with unusual/extreme properties you are almost certainly dealing with the element Unobtainium.\nA.K.A. Handwavium. Compare Author Powers, Hand Wave, MacGuffin, Deus ex Machina, and A Wizard Did It. Contrast Misapplied Phlebotinum. Not to be confused with Phlebotomy.\nApplied Phlebotinum is among the Tropes of Legend.\n"}
{"HistorysCrimeWave": "History's Crime Wave is when historical villains - criminals or tyrants - are used in a work of fiction. This may involve Historical Villain Upgrade. The villains don't have to be on Earth; they just have to be historical, though this can also extend to mythological villains.\nShould not be confused with criminal organizations that really have survived throughout much of history, such as various incarnations of The Mafia.\nSee also Jury of the Damned and Army of the Ages.\n"}
{"HospitalEpilogue": "This trope comes into play when the end of a work features a character (usually a hero but occasionally a villain) waking up a in hospital room, recovering from injuries sustained during the events of the story, very often a big climactic battle, though whether or not they won is up in the air. One can expect them to be visited by friends and/or family. This trope is frequently used to symbolize healing and relief after a bad experience.\nMay be a Hospital Surprise. Often the result of a Post-Victory Collapse.\nAs an Ending Trope, all spoilers on this page are unmarked.\n"}
{"ForbiddenRomance": "Two lovers\u2014often but not always teenagers\u2014doomed to be kept apart no matter how hard they struggle to be together. It may be Fate, or fatally-Feuding Families, or it may be something as mundane as a few hundred miles' separation, but something will always be in their way. Often, the two can only be Together in Death. William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is the most famous example (and the Trope Namer), but the archetype dates at least as far back as Mesopotamian Mythology and Egyptian Mythology, making it Older Than Dirt.\nIn modern times, the term \"star-crossed\" is often unknowingly misused to mean lovers who are meant to be together. It means just the opposite\u2014the stars (i.e. destiny or the heavens) have ruled against them, or \"crossed\" their plan. Compare the word \"disaster\", which has the etymology \"away; without\" (\"dis\") + \"star; planet\" (\"aster\"). Then again, if the stars rule that much, they probably decreed the love as well as the impossibility, making the stars capricious and cruel at the very least. It also refers to destiny and the inevitability of the two characters' paths crossing each other. It usually, but not always, refers to unlucky outcomes, since Romeo and Juliet's affair ended tragically. Further, it may also connote that the lovers entered into their union without sufficient forethought or preparation, that they did not have adequate knowledge of each other, or that they were not thinking rationally (because they were being controlled by fate).\nOne common version of this trope, Love Above One's Station (i.e., being in love with someone from a different social class), is at least discredited if not actually dead and buried in contemporary settings, but was very much true in the past, and can still work when applied to historical settings. While it's difficult even today to have a relationship with someone from a very different background, in the old days, it was all but impossible: if you were from the lower class and courted your \"better\", you'd be treated with the vilest contempt and risk arrest and/or violence (possibly even death); meanwhile, a \"better\" who reciprocated would be disowned and possibly shut off in a nunnery, a monastery\u2014or even an asylum.\nHence all those tragic \"servant/slave/peasant loves the lord/lady/king/queen, and their Love Ruins the Realm\" stories. The accepted practice for someone in love with a royal, at least in contemporary fiction, was to express that love through loyalty and duty rather than presume to have a romantic relationship with them.\nForbidden Love and its sub-tropes are often the reason two lovers are star-crossed. May be used as a Pretext for War. One of the top reasons for a Balcony Wooing Scene.\nContrast Love Transcends Spacetime and Nobody Thinks It Will Work, where the power of love overcomes.\n"}
{"GagSeries": "A comedic show specifically concentrating on being humorous before any concern of plot, drama, or even comprehensibility. Noted for a complete lack of tact or pomposity on the part of the writers, and frequent postmodern commentary. Can have occasional Fanservice which the series will openly acknowledge. The Rule of Funny will be observed.\nBecause they don't take themselves seriously, gag series tend to experiment across the board with parody, lewd humor, random cutaways, and short-lived drama. In a win-win situation, these can be very successful experiments when they succeed, or mocked by the series itself when they fail as a protective tactic. Ironically, they can be praised for presenting such topics without being Anvilicious. However, doing this at the end of a series can cause accusations of being pretentious.\nAnime gag series often use a Puni Plush design. Many are also Widget Series. Shows that depend a lot on puns and parody are typically considered too difficult for commercial releases, and are fansubbed only erratically. A few even get a Gag Dub.\nAnime and Manga are particularly notorious in this genre. Series will regularly go over the top in their nonsense and hilarity even within the context of the show itself. Characters will time-travel, change species or gender, die, destroy buildings, cities, or planets, anything that will push the ridiculousness even higher; also note that these effects are rarely, if ever, permanent. There are times when \"normality\" is broken and restored in the space of a few minutes.\nOccasionally the Gag Series is an adaptation of some 'canonical' source, except now the writers pretty much do whatever they like.\nSee also Big-Lipped Alligator Moment, for cases where an otherwise coherent story has occasional Gag Series interludes.\n"}
{"CutsceneBoss": "Sometimes, instead of allowing the player to face a Video Game boss directly in battle, the game will instead present the battle as a non-interactive sequence or cutscene. This has a few advantages, in that by removing the player's skill from the equation, the battle can achieve a specific outcome using strict choreography \u2014 fully rendered CGI cutscenes can apply their Cutscene Power to the Max, with the player and/or boss executing awesome acrobatic feats that would not otherwise be possible in an actual, in-game battle. This may also happen if the \"Boss\" was fought in a way outside the purview of the game's genre(or the limitation of its engine).\nOn the other hand, if the player was expecting to engage the boss directly, seeing the battle play out with no input from them whatsoever can feel very anticlimactic, even more so than a Zero-Effort Boss.\nThis can be downplayed somewhat if the cutscene employs Press X to Not Die, allowing the player some interactivity even if they have no ultimate say in the battle's outcome (as in most cases, failing to hit the right button immediately fails the battle, forcing the player to try the sequence again).\nCompare Coup de Gr\u00e2ce Cutscene, where the Boss Battle itself was fully interactive, but a cutscene is used to depict the killing blow. See also The Unfought.\n"}
{"WhatDoYouMeanItsPhlebotinum": "It's not easy being an alien on Earth.

Excitedly you tell your native friends about your discovery,\nbut they just look strangely at you. \"What Do You Mean, It's Phlebotinum?\", they ask. \"That's PIZZA!\"\nTruly, these Earthlings are a silly lot.\nCompare Mundane Solution, Worthless Yellow Rocks, Solid Gold Poop, MacGyvering, Powered by a Forsaken Child.\nTo truly fit in this trope, the material should be of immediate use\u2014serve as fuel, weapons, medicine, field repair parts, etc.\nIf it's valuable as raw material or for monetary value, it's very close to an inverted Worthless Yellow Rocks, and should first be considered for addition there.\n"}
{"BossWarningSiren": "In some video games, before you fight a boss, the screen will start flashing red while the word WARNING! flashes up on the screen as the stage music fades out or stops abruptly. Sometimes, it could be a visual warning or an audio warning; it doesn't necessarily have to be both. In any case, this lets the player know that he's about to face off against a more powerful foe.\nOften a Most Wonderful Sound, especially if it precedes an awesome boss. Though when it precedes That One Boss, it also means \"This Is Gonna Suck.\"\nMay overlap with Boss Subtitles. Related to Fight Woosh and Red Alert. See also Suspicious Video Game Generosity.\n"}
{"BeautyBrainsandBrawn": "A group dynamic trope, a type of female Power Trio where one is smart, one is tough, and one is conventionally pretty, popular or feminine.\nOften, to give \"Beauty\" a useful skill, she also acts as the Team Mom, The Kirk, or the mediator when the other two get into their frequent fights. In other cases, she is the one who is socially adept and empathetic, while \"Brains\" has technical skills but is sometimes nerdy or socially awkward.\nThe personalities might also be what the Freudian Trio used to be described as:\nIn other words, the Brawn represents the Id, the Brain represents the Superego, and the Beauty represents the Ego.\nOften Color-Coded for Your Convenience as the Brainy Brunette, the Fiery Redhead and the beautiful but Dumb Blonde (keeping with giving them a skill, sometimes they can also be an example of Hair of Gold, Heart of Gold). Contrast though as the Blonde, Brunette, Redhead tend to be portrayed as flaws while Beauty, Brains and Brawn are good.\nWhen they form a Big, Thin, Short Trio, the big one will almost invariably be the brawn. When they form a Town Girls trio, usually the femme one will be the beauty, the butch one will be the brawn, and the neither will be the brains.\nSee also: The Hecate Sisters, The Three Faces of Eve, and Four-Girl Ensemble.\n"}
{"NorthIsColdSouthIsHot": "It seems quite common in fantasy worlds to have an arctic or temperate climate in the northern hemisphere, and a tropical climate in the southern hemisphere, i.e., a cold north and a hot south.\nIn reality, it doesn't quite work this way. You have a cold north... and a cold south. The only \"hot\" part is in the middle. This representation probably comes from the fact that a majority of the world's population lives in the Northern Hemisphere, where this trope seems true.\nThis is Older Than Dirt: Aristotle knew the world was round, and assumed that the south pole was just as cold as the north pole, but he believed the lands near the equator were so hot that they were impassable. To be fair, his reference for \"lands near the equator\" was the Sahara Desert.\nThe idea of the Grim Up North and The Savage South are intimately linked to this trope.\nSee also: Fantasy World Map, Patchwork Map.\n"}
{"TheMermaidProblem": "In any work of fiction with mermaids, there's a good chance that a male character will begin a romantic, or even a sexual, relationship with one.\nThere's just one problem for the intrepid sailor looking for a port in these waters: there's no... obvious point of entry.\nThat isn't to say, of course, that mermaids are completely lacking in sexual organs. Real fish, of course, have actual genitals. They just aren't compatible with those of a human, let alone easy to find or obvious to point out. A few biologists have a hard time even calling Piscine reproductive organs \"genitals\" because they are so very different from what we humans would recognize. Many (though not all) fish reproduce externally, meaning that conception happens outside of the body. Females deposit their eggs into the water to be fertilized by the males' similarly free-floating sperm.\nOf course, most writers simply disregard the biological impossibilities. Many writers simply Hand Wave any difficulties by saying that mermaids have the ability to assume fully human form under special circumstances. Alternatively, a sufficiently bawdy work \u2014 which one is likely to be if it brings up the Mermaid Problem in the first place \u2014 may simply point out that lower half aside, well... she's still got a mouth, hasn't she? Yet alternatively, mermaids with two tails (called melusina) do exist. (But only in sufficiently bawdy works. And Starbucks.)\nThis trope mainly deals with the variety where they don't gain human legs. It is equally applicable to mermen, since they'd lack a penis for all the same reasons (a compatible one, anyway - some fish do have penises). Sometimes this problem may be lampshaded, but others no explanation is given. Compare Non-Mammal Mammaries. A good number of series and fiction writers just have the fish/human separation dip a little in the front (in a U-shape) to allow for the genitalia, or use other methods to get the same result. Of course, merfolk with dolphin lower halves would have the appropriate plumbing and explain the mammaries too, but this idea doesn't appear in fiction as often as one would think.\n"}
{"HolidayAppropriateWeather": "During holidays, the weather is always perfectly appropriate. For example, on the Fourth of July it's sunny (for barbecuing and fireworks) and on Christmas it always snows.\nRelated to Let There Be Snow, where someone asks for, and gets, Christmas snow in a usually non-snowy location. It may be a good idea to point out the fact that it may have never once rained on Halloween in fiction might be notable. Pick a Halloween Episode, any Halloween episode, and you'll realize quickly that it is always a nice night for trick-or-treating.\nMore to the point, it's never snowed on Halloween in fiction, even though there's a lot of parts of the world where it does so on occasion. Halloween thunderstorms aren't all that odd in the horror genre, though.\nFourth of July rain or a Christmas with no snow happens occasionally but never in any works. Dreaming of a White Christmas is the subtrope.\n"}
{"Sneezing": "The Japanese and Chinese equivalent of \"burning ears\". If you sneeze once, it means someone is talking or thinking about you; sneeze twice, it means someone is talking or thinking bad things about you.\nAfter a discussion describing a particular person or group of people, there will be a momentary fast cut to that person or a member of the group (who is currently uninvolved in the action) suddenly sneezing and looking confused, followed by a fast cut back to the original discussion. Often, an observing character will show Genre Blindness and suggest that the sneezer is coming down with a cold.\nThis can also be used as a segue without the cut back to the original scene. This is often an equivalent to the Ironic Echo Cut in western works.\n"}
{"Sourcebook": "The great thing about tabletop roleplaying games, to the gamer, is that they're open-ended. Unlike their electronic descendants, they usually don't rely on a single in-built storyline, but allow the Game Master to implement an indefinite number of scenarios he or she may imagine.\nThe bad thing about tabletop roleplaying games, to the publisher, is that they're open-ended. After all, once a player has bought a copy of your game, they can use those rules to implement an indefinite number of scenarios they've imagined... for free.\nThus, to a large degree, game publishers are dependent on continual expansion of the game with new material outside the basic rules of play. These can include:\n"}
{"MassivelyNumberedSiblings": "This is when a family has five or more children under the same roof. The parents will probably be Happily Married and have usually bred like rabbits. Sometimes they are the collective root of The Clan; other times, at least some of the children are from previous relationships. Expect this to be a noisy, rowdy clan as a whole. Also, this family will probably be portrayed in a positive light.\nIf this trope intersects with the Badass Family trope, be very afraid. But it's more often Played for Laughs.\nIf the entire family consists of animals, it likely serves as a Furry Reminder (if the animals usually act human), as many animals usually give birth to litters.\nFor some reason, a popular subject for Reality TV shows \u2014 probably because this is extremely rare nowadays. In older works and stories, it sometimes just happens in passing. In the same way, older works had tropes like \"the seventh son of a seventh son is always some kind of Chosen One\", and this wasn't some phenomenon that's extremely rare to begin with, the way it is now.\nIn older works, this is generally seen as something great, because, in reality, most people had massive numbers of children; this trope indicated not the number of births but the lack of deaths. (One reason you had so many was that in few families did all survive.) Nowadays it's more a comedy trope. It was also common for the siblings in older works to be all female, with their parents disappointed that they weren't getting the son they wanted no matter how often they tried. Depending how important they are to the work, expect the siblings to have varying and distinct personalities.\nSee also The Clan, Big, Screwed-Up Family and Tangled Family Tree, likely results of this kind of birthrate lasting more than one generation.\nInexplicably Identical Individuals overlaps with this. Likely to lead to a whole lot of children suffering from Middle Child Syndrome; in fiction especially it can also result in an Outnumbered Sibling. Contrast Only Child Syndrome. See also Magical Seventh Son.\n"}
{"FillerArc": "Filler episodes are entries in a generally continuous serial that are unrelated to the main plot, don't significantly alter the relations between the characters, and generally serve only to take up space. This could be considered Padding applied to a whole franchise.\nThey are extremely common in Anime, where many shows have 26 or more episodes per season. The producers have to use filler just to meet contractual demands. Filler is usually something entirely original for the anime, but not always; many manga - particularly weekly manga - employ filler just as ruthlessly due to the extreme deadlines. Sometimes entire filler Arcs are created, most often because the series Overtook the Manga. Just about every long-running manga-based anime action series will have gargantuan amounts of filler over time. This is because Japanese networks, unlike western ones, don't do reruns or season breaks. This is compounded when they go beyond the 26 episode mark. Many series air over 40 episodes per year, when they would have a hard time making even half of them related to the main plot.\nIn most cases, the defining aspect of filler is the lack of series momentum. Filler can be safely ignored without any loss of important information. However, there is also a style of filler called the \"single upgrade filler\". This uses a filler episode to introduce a new power, machine, costume, minor character, etc. without having to work it into the greater narrative. In these cases, the episode can be ignored outside of \"something got an upgrade\".\nThe term \"filler\" is also used by fandom to refer to anything that isn't in the source material. This stems from the practice mentioned above of adaptations that are threatening to catch up to the source using original story arcs, episodes, and general content to pad things out. That is not this trope, see Overtook the Manga or Adaptation Expansion, but such cases are often related to it.\nThe Wacky Wayside Tribe is a common form of filler in quest narratives. When the show splits to follow two or more characters, and one of them is engaged in filler-type activities while the others are doing important things, it's Trapped by Mountain Lions. A Lower-Deck Episode can end up as filler if badly done. When the filler is just flat-out bizarre, it's a Bizarro Episode. If you need filler badly enough, clips of previous episodes can be hacked together into a Recap Episode.\nRemember, Tropes Are Not Bad: Just as a plot-related episode can be unenjoyable if handled badly, a filler episode can be great fun if done well.\nCompare Fake Longevity, Gaiden Game and Side Quest, the video game equivalents. For filler in Web Comics, see Filler Strips. For filler in Music albums, see Album Filler.\nCompare Breather Episode and Out-of-Genre Experience. When the news media is forced to resort to this, it's Silly Season or Sweeps.\n"}
{"OdangoHair": "A particular hairstyle common to anime and manga heroines (particularly Chinese ones, although in China the style is called \"ox horn\") that involves styling one's hair into two buns worn at about 45-degree angles on the side of the head. This can make them look similar to Mickey Mouse ears depending on how simplified they're drawn. The buns themselves are often given cloth covers tied with ribbons.\nThere is also a less common variation of this style where the buns themselves have a triangular (or conical) shape, which can make someone look like a Cat Girl at first sight.\nThe style has spread into the real world among fans of the aforementioned heroines. Naoko Takeuchi used to wear her hair like Sailor Moon's before important exams during college, so she incorporated it into her heroine.\nIf the character isn't Chinese, expect them to be the really innocent, polite type, while the style with Twin Tails are mostly worn by Tsundere.\nDoes NOT count if the buns are over the character's ears. That's the Princess Leia. This style, with or without cloth covers, is different because it is used to signal maturity rather than cuteness. This is because the hairstyle covers the ears, and thus was seen as modest and chaste.\nThe style is named after the odango, a sweet dumpling eaten on a skewer as a Japanese snack, traditionally served at hanami (cherry blossom and flower viewing festivals.) Compare Horned Hairdo and Prim and Proper Bun. This style can be wildly over-exaggerated as Mega Twintails.\n"}
{"RedeemingReplacement": "A rare occurrence which is in some ways the inverse of Anti-Hero Substitute, this is a Comic Book trope wherein one holder of a certain identity (usually a Legacy Character) is a hero despite all other versions of that character being villains.\nSometimes the character taking on this persona will speak of a desire to \"redeem\" that identity, especially if they are a child of the villainous wearer of the costume. Arguably, this trope happens for similar reasons as the Anti-Hero Substitute. The Anti-Hero Substitute aims to make a hero \"cooler\" by having a character with the hero's powers but less restraint in using them. In a similar way, Evil Is Cool, and this trope allows villain powers to be showcased, but by a character with heroic aims.\nBy definition, all previous holders of the position would be a Hero's Evil Predecessor.\nDC Universe\n"}
{"FlirtyStepSiblings": "So you've got two unrelated teenagers whose parents have recently gotten hitched. Said teenagers happen to have compatible sexual/romantic orientations. Whether they find it squicky or not, hormones are going to fly.\nUsually this is seen in the undertones of their behavior in a show, and it almost always happens when two people become step-siblings in adolescence. Sometimes though, this is unintentional on the part of the writers and attempts to make new step-siblings act like a long-time brother and sister just come off as flirty.\nThe Romance Novel is also fond of this trope, generally involving older stepsiblings. It has the double effect of giving them reason to resent each other over their lives' disruption and giving them no way to escape the other entirely (without cutting off from their parent as well).\nSort of a vanilla version of Not Blood Siblings. See Little Sister Heroine for when the relationship is made more explicit and emphasized.\nPeople who become step-siblings at a very young age and grow up together are more likely to consider each other truly siblings and thus off limits for dating. This may also cross the line in the supposed Westermarck Effect, a theory that the instinctive biological aversion to mating with a sibling or childhood friend is highly dependent on actually being raised in close proximity to said sibling/childhood friend. This trope can be Truth in Television for many stepsiblings whose parents married during or after their puberty, though they rarely end up becoming an official couple due to social factors. However many actual people find this trope to be a form of Incest Is Relative.\n"}
{"LevelScaling": "A specific form of Anti-Grinding, usually seen in RPGs and Roguelikes, though it could potentially be used in any game with Character Levels. Level Scaling is where the world (or specific areas) levels up with you to provide a constant challenge, primarily by upping your foes' stats.\nThere are three kinds of foe level scaling systems that are commonly used. One is where enemies simply have their stats and/or equipment improved. Another is a system where the number of enemies are increased. The third is a system where weaker enemies are replaced by different, stronger ones. Taking an encounter with a 25 hitpoint wolf in its den as an example - In the first system, the same wolf may have 100 hitpoints at a later level. In the second system, an entire pack of wolves will be encountered at higher levels. In the third system, the wolf will be replaced by a dire wolf or a bear after a certain level is reached. There may also be a combination of the three, so you may encounter wolves that progressively get stronger and increase in number, up until a certain point, where they'll be joined by dire wolves (with dire wolves growing more common at higher levels) or replaced by bears who also progressively get stronger as you level up. Most games employing level scaling also make use of a level cap for certain enemies and/or certain areas, so the cellar in the first tavern you enter isn't going to filled with level 100 rats when you return later.\nWhen done well, it does exactly as intended, providing a constant challenge that keeps the game fun, and will keep itself largely unobtrusive. Otherwise, it can head straight into Empty Levels and cause situations where leveling your character can actually make the game more difficult, such as by having things like regular enemies outleveling friendly NPCs in the game, making things like escort and defense missions a lot more difficult at higher levels. Underleveling (purposefully keeping yourself or your party at a low level) can become a viable tactic (and, under certain circumstances, a Gamebreaker) if this trope is in effect. It can also lead to, (usually) unintentional cases of Improbable Power Discrepancy, depending on when a player first enters an area.\nThis is becoming more common in RPGs, especially sandbox-style RPGs, as it makes it easier to keep the player challenged, while limiting the need for predicting the level the player will be at when they reach a certain point.\nCompare Kill One, Others Get Stronger, where killing foes makes others stronger. Contrast Sorting Algorithm of Evil, where the enemies get tougher as you go along, regardless of your own level.\nSub-Trope of Dynamic Difficulty.\n"}
{"WizardsAndWitches": "Those wonderful men and women who command a power beyond mortal understanding. Whether as boon or bane of mankind, a wizard or witch has the supernatural tools and weapons to take on whatever is at hand. And if it's not at hand, they can conjure one up to get it.\nNote that this is not Magic by Any Other Name. This is for characters and tropes that use magic and don't dance around calling it magic.\nAlso, this is not about Magic and Powers; it's about the people who use it, and the tropes they end up involved in.\n"}
{"ThemeTable": "Taking motifs Up to Eleven. Every major player has the same sort of objects associated with them. Say, a group of heroes where every member has their own animal spirit, weapon, and elemental alignment. Or every country has their own gem, compass direction, and celestial body. That sort of thing.\nPretty common in toylines, and consequentially in Merchandise-Driven series, probably because arranging products this way can encourage people to form collections of them and perhaps also because it can allow more toys per idea. On the flip side it also tends to appear in heavy lore driven series to build out the world.\nSo named because as it all seems to have been plotted out using a table.\nCompare Arc Number. See Also Geodesic Cast.\n"}
{"EvilSorceror": "The Evil Sorcerer is the living (or occasionally undead) proof of the maxim that power corrupts and that absolute power corrupts absolutely.\nThey're the mage who has delved too deeply into Things Man Was Not Meant to Know and mastered The Dark Arts. They've achieved great power, but at the expense of their soul. They deal in Black Magic and might well have made a Deal with the Devil. Evil Sorcerers are very dangerous foes, as they are creative as well as clever. From them, one can expect anything; hordes of demonic (Or Undead) Mooks as the bluntest tool, More Than Mind Control as the subtlest one, and anything between those two and beyond. They will probably be a Sorcerous Overlord, dwelling in an Evil Tower of Ominousness and ruling the land with an iron \u2014 but also magical \u2014 fist, though they may also show up as an Evil Chancellor, using their powers to subvert the throne more subtly.\nThe Evil Sorcerer nearly always gets top billing as a villain, as one of their most common traits is pride. Where they're a second-stringer, they're likely to only be one-upped by a demonic bargain gone wrong \u2014 probably because they cheated. This makes them prone to learning the painful lesson that Evil Is Not a Toy. They might also be upstaged by a God of Evil \u2014 but then, the most powerful Evil Sorcerers often have delusions of godhood themselves. In a villainous hierarchy, they'll most likely be the Big Bad, The Dragon, or the Evil Genius (though they could also be The Man Behind the Man or, if they're little loyalty to any particular faction, the Wild Card). Killing the Evil Sorcerer is one way to stop their Keystone Army.\nThe Evil Sorcerer can be at several levels of the Super Weight scale (depending on how strong magic is in a given setting) but he'll almost always be far more powerful than the heroes (unless they manage to get physical with them), and will probably be at least superficially stronger than their good counterparts (owing to possessing powers that they can't or won't use). If they're an Evil Archmage, everybody should watch out.\nIt's likely that every sorcerer will be this if Magic Is Evil. Compare the Wicked Witch and (for the more modern descendant) Mad Scientist. Female versions are likely to also be a Vain Sorceress. An undead Evil Sorcerer will probably be called a Lich.\n"}
{"OfferVoidInNebraska": "Hey! We've got a marvelous, fantastic deal for you, one that will make your wallet heavier, your life better, your teeth whiter and your significant other want to have sex with you every night. And the price is so damn low, we're CRAZY!\nExcept for you doofs in Nebraska. You're stuck out, and we're certainly not going to tell you why. Na na na-na na!\nOften summed up quite simply with \"Void where prohibited,\" a phrase which shifts the onus of learning about obscure laws away from the seller and onto the consumer.\nCompare to No Export for You. If it's a limitation to something that is being exported, it's this trope crossing with Bad Export for You. For more information on why this trope happened, see the Analysis page.\n"}
{"SeparateButIdentical": "In real-time strategy games, usually those in which the different sides represent wildly different cultures or even different species, there will often be colour-coded sub-factions that are said to be different in terms of composition, outlook or somesuch, but in actual practice there is no difference except the visual one.\nSometimes a form of Gameplay and Story Segregation.\nSubtrope of Palette Swap. See Cosmetically Different Sides, when it's applied to more than a select few units, and Underground Monkey, when the later versions are stronger, but not when compared to the heroes. Not to be confused with Separate But Equal.\n"}
{"EmotionalEmotionlessPerson": "He's incapable of emotion, or so he says. Really he's as compassionate and sensitive as the next guy, or more so. In fact he's probably the nicest guy in the series. Ironic, isn't it?\nThis often leads to a paradoxical quest to Become a Real Boy, or at least learn emotions. If they didn't have emotions to begin with, how can they desperately feel the need to have them?\nIt also seems that certain emotions count more than others. Warm fuzzy happiness counts more than anger, frustration or sadness. So someone can be an aggressive wangster but since they can't enjoy the smell of a flower, it's stated they can't feel emotions. The Stoic Woobie hinges on this trope; their character lies in seeming outwardly unemotional, yet still feeling emotions deep down, thus maintaining their woobie status. Perhaps if they were more honest and said they want to be happy instead of just having emotions in general, they'd be more successful.\nRefers to the character in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Who, in fact, was prone to Tender Tears, to give the game away entirely. Other unconscious tics, such as destroying whatever is in the character's hands while denying anger, can betray other Tin Men.\nTruth in Television: What's usually being depicted here is someone who is out of touch with their emotions, experiencing them without being aware of them. This is not so uncommon in real life! Reasons can include machismo, denial, some mental illnesses (depression!), or certain cognitive abnormalities (e.g., the autistic spectrum). There's also a personality trait known as alexithymia, which is defined by the mind having great difficulty in identifying feelings, distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal, and in describing feelings to other people. Lastly, anger is heavily influenced by a different part of the brain from other emotions, which can explain why a person can be angry, but not know why they're angry, or lash out in a particular way and unaware that anger is fueling their actions.\nThe dark flipside of the trope is especially common in Science Fiction or Fantasy, where whole races may be introduced as \"logical\" and beyond base emotions; and then turns out to be arrogant, harsh, hateful, merciless or borderline unstable, as if they've lost their positive emotions but kept all the bad ones. Apparently, many authors confuse being emotionless with being a Jerk Ass who derides those emotions considered \"weak\", like mercy, empathy, altruism, love, humility, compassion and the ability to see someone else's point of view. Or basic politeness. So instead of an indifferent race that cannot be bothered over differences and levels of evolution, what we get is a race that is willing to exterminate anyone with extreme prejudice because they feel arrogance and contempt, but neither shame nor horror.\nCompare Frozen Face, where he cannot show the emotions in his face even if he feels them on the inside. Compare and contrast with The Stoic and the Emotionless Girl, who unlike the Tin Man do not emote, regardless of whether they have feelings or not. Not to be confused with the Syfy miniseries.\n"}
{"MagiBabble": "Like Techno Babble, but about magic, typically Rule Magic. This is usually used in series where Magic A Is Magic A, and the rules are defined enough that you can't get away with invoking them in new ways without having to explain it first. See also Blah Blah Blah.\n"}
{"RebelWithoutACause": "Teen drama from The '50s in which James Dean, Natalie Wood, and Sal Mineo deal with Angst. Notably averts the Teens Are Monsters mindset of the era. The film is directed by Nicholas Ray.Dean is Jim Stark, a Troubled, but Cute 17-year-old with a messed-up home life. His mother (Ann Doran) prefers to move whenever a problem comes up rather than confront it and his father (Jim Backus) is a Henpecked Husband who lets her do as she pleases. As a result, the Starks are constantly moving around and have just arrived in Los Angeles as the film opens. At his new High School, Jim befriends John \"Plato\" Crawford (Mineo), an Ambiguously Gay innocent. Jim immediately finds himself up against Buzz (Corey Allen), the local Jerk Jock, but takes somewhat more kindly to Buzz's girlfriend Judy (Wood). Needless to say, she later becomes Jim's girlfriend. Most of the movie takes place on a night after a chicken race gone horribly wrong.There is a \"Rebel Without A Cause curse\". The film's three main stars (Dean, Wood, and Mineo) all met tragic deaths at a young age, Dean before the film even opened.note\u00a0Dean was 24 when he was killed in a car crash, Wood was 43 when she drowned under mysterious circumstances, and Mineo was 37 when he was stabbed by a mugger."}
{"DopplegangerAttack": "Similar to Doppelg\u00e4nger Spin, Doppelganger Attack involves making multiple copies of oneself, during combat. Unlike the former, however, the \"copies\" are actual physical copies, be they manifestations of energy, split off from the original, or copies made of stone, clay, or another material. As they are solid copies, there is no \"which one is the real one\" game to be played here: They're essentially all \"real\", and all dangerous. They can be used to attack, train, or defend the original. If the copies are unable to rejoin with the original after being created or summoned, they may have the Cloning Blues.\nWhile they are all solid, often the summoned copies are much weaker than the original, and can be killed more quickly. The major difference between this and Doppelg\u00e4nger Spin is that the doppelgangers are able to attack, even if they can be destroyed by being hit once or twice. Sometimes making more copies makes the original opponent weaker, due to the Conservation of Ninjutsu. In fact, Ninja-theme characters in Toku are frequently an example of both these tropes.\nCompare Doppelg\u00e4nger Spin, Me's a Crowd and Weaponized Offspring. Expect lots of Power Perversion Potential. If the Doppelganger attacking is of the player, it's a Mirror Boss.\n"}
{"ChasteToons": "Many cartoon characters intended for children, especially the \"iconic\" ones, always seem to be surrounded by kids when the plot calls for it. These children are never their own, however, but the offspring of a brother or sister of the main character we never get to see. For whatever reason, they also tend to be the result of multiple births.\nIt's common for main characters in a cartoon series to be unmarried. This allows for plots to involve things like dating, but since Status Quo Is God, they probably won't ever stay with any partner for very long, let alone get married. And since these are generally kids' shows we're talking about, no marriage means they'll never have children.\nThus, nephews and/or nieces become the safest way to integrate young family members into a children's show. The main character's romantic life can remain unburdened for plot purposes, and they can spend a lot of time hanging around kids without inspiring audience worry that anything untoward is going on. Unseen aunts and uncles also mean that when the plot calls for the main character to go off on some adventure where having a kid in tow would hinder the plot, the kids can disappear for a while without anyone asking who's watching them.\nAlso works as a reverse Parental Bonus. Single characters can be easily placed in risqu\u00e9 situations that imply they are less than fully chaste, as well as Ship Tease moments. Good thing the kids are too stupid to notice those.\nNote that kids who are (at least implicitly) the biological children of single main characters aren't unheard of \u2014 it's just that the precise circumstances of their family situation will never be addressed, never mind the fact that pantsless cartoon characters have no apparent reproductive organs. Occasionally, characters will even have sons or daughters running around completely out of nowhere, with no effort whatsoever given to explaining who the parents were.\nNote: The concept of an uncle at least looking after a child is an old tradition: if a parent died, the uncle would become the foster father (and in many cases marry the mother). For instance: The Hobbit, Harry Potter, Spider-Man, Star Wars, etc. In some cultures, (such as the ludicrously-often-used-for-examples Trobriand Islanders), the uncle is the \"standard\" parent while fathers have very little to do with raising their biological children (they're busy raising their sister's children instead, obviously).\nFor the non-animated version, where the absence of parents is most likely part of the plot, see Nephewism.\n"}
{"TheMaker": "A person/people (often a god, although the occasional Mad Scientist or Evilutionary Biologist dabbles in this as well), that has/have created an entire place or species. Frequently in fantasy fiction, there are often several creators of the races that inhabit the world, and the ones who created them are often labeled as the Top God of the race's respective pantheon. The creator of the world or setting is often above these gods, someone who may in fact be the true Top God.\nA common subtype has a being that personally created the monsters of the setting, which is usually inspired by Echidna, who mothered so many of the monsters found throughout Greek Mythology to earn the title \"Mother of Monsters.\"\nA Creation Myth often involves a character of this type, although what's made could have been created without the involvement of any being whatsoever. Some type of spontaneous generation, perhaps? See also The Power of Creation.\nContrast Destroyer Deity (if the maker happens to be God, the destroyer deity is likely to be The Anti-God), though some gods may be enough of a multitasker that they combine both the creator and destroyer god roles.\nDon't confuse with Thank the Maker.\n"}
{"MunDanger": "If your world is a Fantasy Kitchen Sink where the heroes spend every week battling vampires, aliens, ghosts and fairies, one easy way to mix things up a little is to scrap the supernatural element altogether for a chapter and have the heroes fight something relatively mundane, be it a serial killer, a robber or even just a murderously grumpy animal.\nOf course, since the heroes spend most of their time putting down creatures that are generally more dangerous and powerful than human beings, it's common to make these villains even more of a threat \u2014 expect to see your heroes knocked about (physically or mentally) more than usual. Cannibals are a common choice, largely because they border on monster-level weirdness anyway and aren't quite as played out as the Serial Killer.\nTo help make the threat even more convincing, you can expect the writers to make these episodes darker than the usual fare, possibly through gruesome horror or psychological tension. The latter is particularly useful, since it can lead to the characters inflicting nasty violence on humans rather than monsters for once. If the heroes can't kill humans then expect a Karmic Death. And if the show is given to platitudes you can expect some \"the real monster is man\" philosophising at the end \u2014 even though the werewolves, zombies and demons that appear in all the other episodes make it clear that man is only one among the other real monsters.\nThe Mundanger may be part of a \"Scooby-Doo\" Hoax \u2014 though with deadlier consequences than Scooby-Doo would often encounter. Contrast How Unscientific!, where a show set in an ordinary world features a seemingly real supernatural event in one episode.\nCompare They Look Just Like Everyone Else! and sister trope Mundangerous for superpowered beings being taken out by similarly low threat objects. If at all interested, the trope name is a portmanteau of \"mundane\" and \"danger'' and not some Super Robot series you just about remember but turns out never existed.

{"FantasticMetals": "In Real Life, a metal is an element of the periodic table which belongs to one of certain groups/columns and has a specific type crystal lattice with free electrons. In fiction, especially fantasy, a metal is shiny stuff with wonderful properties like super strength, lightness, magic resistance and so on, often not resembling any of the metals found in the periodic table. Metals that are brittle, soft, flammable, react violently with water or air or are otherwise useless for smithing swords and shields from them never appear in fantasy, despite there being a lot of these in Real Life. This trope (a supertrope to Mithril and Orichalcum) describes the \"shiny and wondrous\" kind of metals.\nNote that this is mostly a Fantasy trope. Science-fiction examples are only good if they are from a work that is \"science\" in name only (such as four-color comics or space fantasy like Star Wars or Warhammer 40,000); harder-science materials actually explained as high-tech alloys with some verisimilitude aren't. In a nutshell, Wolverine's adamantium and Boba Fett's Mandalorian iron are examples of this trope, but a composite of titanium around a carbon nanotube matrix isn't.\nReal Life examples are only allowed if they are in fact occult superstitions (like hard mercury) or well-known hoaxes (like red mercury).\nThe most often-encountered types of fantasy metal are:\nSilver is a real metal, but fiction and folklore treat it as fantastic. Electrum also exists in Real Life, but can also be magic.\nThe list of fantasy metals is much longer than that, but most examples are work-specific and should go in the examples list.\nA fantasy-specific subtrope of Unobtainium. See also Parodic Table of the Elements, Elemental Crafting (which ranks these and other normal metals and materials by usefulness).\nFor fantasy-based metal music, see Heavy Mithril.\n"}
{"StarPower": "Related to Lunacy and The Power of the Sun, Star Power is magic fueled by, of course, the stars.\nGenerally comes in one of two forms, \"Classical\" and \"Lovecraftian\". \"Classical\" star power, derived from the traditional use of the stars and the motions of the planets to predict the future, is concerned primarily with fate and divination. \"Lovecraftian\" star power takes its cues from H. P. Lovecraft (of course) and evokes the unfathomable otherness and distance of the stars and whatever inhabitants they may have.\nDon't be surprised if your Star Powered-character refers frequently to constellations, perhaps referring to the influence of the Western Zodiac and other planetary bodies. As an offense, the stars may be helpful to Light 'em Up. Causing meteors to fall from the sky to strike your opponents is not out of the question for either type. On the opposite side of the scale, this may extend itself to power that comes from galaxies or even the entire universe.\nOften the reasoning behind using something made of Thunderbolt Iron. If the person who uses Star Power is actually made of stars, see Celestial Body.\nFor related \"space\" powers, see Gravity Master and Reality Warper. Not to be confused with the webcomic Star Power or that other Star Power.\n"}
{"WeirdAside": "During what had previously been a perfectly ordinary conversation, one character nonchalantly inserts something completely bizarre, and often disturbing, which often derails the conversation. They may do this knowingly or innocently, not realizing how strange what they are saying is. This is often used for humorous purposes (even by the very character, if knowingly) or to add emphasis to how screwed up a life the particular character had, that they think something like that would be normal or conversation-appropriate.\nHere's an example:\nOld Lady: \"Oh, this recipe? Well, when I fought the militias in Qurac, I met this woman who taught it to me. Very sweet lady, even though her husband made that Deal with the Devil. Anyways, first you take two eggs, separate the whites and the yolks... Are you listening?\"\nSimilar to Bread, Eggs, Milk, Squick, only it's in a conversation and it's actually Bread, Eggs, Milk, Beat... wait, what? It can also be Bread Eggs Milk Squick depending on the content of the aside. Very closely related to Left-Fielder.\nLive-Action TV\nLiterature\nNewspaper Comics\nWeb Animation\nVideo Games\nWestern Animation\nReal Life\n"}
{"HumansAreDivided": "So you have your fantasy setting. The elves are all ruled by the gracious Queen Bona, the dwarves are all loyal to the mighty King Stormhammer, and the orcish hordes are all under the iron fist of Lord Grimdark. And the humans?\nWell, the humans have King James, King Seth, Queen Alex, President Ian, and Archmage Bill. And they all hate each other.\nHumans, as a species, seem to be uniquely prone to factioning and intra-species conflict. If ever humans arise in a story, there are likely to be multiple kingdoms with poor relations. Multiple nations may exist for other races as well, but they usually like each other fine, unlike the humans, who will constantly try to get the edge on their \"rival,\" even in the face of The Horde.\nPlease note that this is only for cases where the humans are divided, in stark contrast to other races/species in the setting. If everyone hates each other, and the humans aren't special, then it's not an example.\n"}
{"ZeroEffortBoss": "A Zero-Effort Boss is a boss that's about as threatening as the crates you destroy for ammo. Against these foes, you'd actively have to try to lose such a boss battle. At its most extreme, you are incapable of losing even if you tried to.\nThe most common version is The Man Behind the Curtain/Non-Action Big Bad variety. You have slaughtered the Big Bad's Mooks, infiltrated the Evil Tower of Ominousness, battled through the Elite Guard, and barely survived the fight against The Dragon. All that's left is the weak, unarmed, defenseless mastermind behind it all. A subversion of Authority Equals Asskicking, usually the Dragon-in-Chief was intended to be the real Final Boss, and this one-shot kill is meant to provide closure to the story. Or maybe it's just Played for Laughs that the Dark Lord Bludentiers is a fat slob who can barely lift a sword. Sometimes, there is an actual battle, but it's effectively won on the penultimate hit, requiring the player to finish off a vastly weakened enemy.\nA less common variety is that for some reason, perhaps 11th-Hour Superpower, you are invincible for the final battle. This invincibility may not be obvious at first, since you still suffer damage and get attacked, and only reveal itself when you lose all health. Either way, it is impossible to lose.\nCompare Breather Boss and Anti-Climax Boss. Not to be confused with a Cutscene Boss, which is not only zero-effort, but zero-interactivity. It doesn't count if you spent 10 hours Level Grinding to kill the boss in one hit, that's not zero-effort. Compare Clipped-Wing Angel.\nIn some cases, the player Wins by Doing Absolutely Nothing, with not even a single button press required to defeat the boss.\nContrast Hopeless Boss Fight, which relates to boss battles you cannot win for the sake of the plot.\n"}
{"ThoseWilyCoyotes": "Coyotes are some of the most crafty animals on the planet, traits which they share with foxes. Where wolves are struggling to survive in a world where their habitats are disappearing, coyotes have moved in and adapted so well we sometimes wonder who the suburbs were actually built for, us or them.\nIn Native American Mythology, he's a recurring character. One story even claims Coyote stole fire for man, and is seen as a benevolent (if tricky) God.\nThen again, other times he's a bit of a fool, and can get himself into trouble, thinking he's got everything figured out. Outside of Native American portrayals, various other portrayals of coyotes don't take them quite as seriously as they take foxes and wolves, including one coyote who is arguably one of the most memorable Ineffectual Sympathetic Villains ever.\nCoyotes in general though have a special place as tricksters, guides and a link to the unseen world. Other times, they are associated with the darker aspects of mysticism, along with cruelty and deceit, and may be a Skin-walker in disguise.\nAnyways, you can bet that if a story wants to have an indigenous American flavor, a Coyote is bound to show up sooner or later. The association is so strong, it's spilled over into representing 'the American West' in general. They are often also shapeshifters, which goes along with their crafty, deceptive nature. And if there is any animal out there smart enough to talk, it's going to be the coyote, and he'll probably be snarky, too. Despite the fact that coyotes can live in bands, just like wolves do packs, they are usually seen as loners in folklore and media. Other common associations include shamanism, mystery, nature, or intelligence.\nCompare Cunning Like a Fox and Clever Crows, who share a lot of the same associations as the Coyote, as they play similar roles in Native American Mythology. May be used as part of an Animal Motif. See also Animal Stereotypes.\n"}
{"WrongAssumption": "It's not that difficult for a character in a work to jump to conclusions. They might believe that they're a certain trope, that a different character is a certain trope, or at least that a certain trope is happening around them. But it turns out that they are very much wrong. And unfortunately, it will often take them until the end of the story to realize their mistake. In a Darker and Edgier story, they might not even realize the truth until it's too late for them to get a Happy Ending. In a Lighter and Softer story, only the villain will really be a victim to this and meet his/her downfall.\nSome tropes in the The Wannabe Index (like Big Bad Wannabe, Casanova Wannabe, Prince Charming Wannabe etc) and Mistaken for Index are sub-topes of this trope. There can be overlaps with Entertainingly Wrong, Hidden Depths, Horrible Judge of Character, Idiot Ball and More Than Meets the Eye as well. Compare also with Wrong Genre Savvy, where a character acts as if they're in a different genre than what they really are.\n"}
{"VoiceActors": "Those voices you hear in Cartoons, Anime, Video Games, Puppet Shows, and Commercials don't exist in a vacuum. While not quite as famous as regular live-action actors, these folks still get a lot of mention among fans for their distinctive style and/or extensive catalogs.\nThis index page is meant for actors whose primary career is in voice work, or at least have an extensive history of voiceovers. Don't bother listing live-action actors who also happen to do a rare voiceover.\nThere is considerable overlap between this list and Names to Know in Anime. See also Puppeteers.\n"}
{"ScorpionPeople": "Scorpion people are chimeric beings combing the physical characteristics of scorpions and of humanoids. They almost always have segmented tails tipped with poisonous stingers, since it's the signature physical feature of a scorpion; they're often also poisonous in general, and some have claws while others do not \u2014 if they do, these can either replace their hands or, if the scorpion person is centaurine in shape, be attached to their waists, where the scorpion's mouth would be if it weren't attached to a human body.\nScorpion people have been around for quite a long time \u2014 centaur-like scorpion people first appear in Sumerian and Baylonian myths, under the names of aqrabuamelu or girtablilu, as powerful guardians of places the gods don't want humans poking around in. Many modern works use this as inspiration and depict them as guardians of holy sites in desert settings. These scorpion centaurs are the likeliest to be called girtablilu.\nScorpion People can also appear as a more exotic or threatening alternative to Spider People. In general, scorpions are perceived in fiction as an Unpleasant Animal Counterpart to spiders: while heroic or benevolent spiders are far from unheard of, scorpions are much more universally portrayed as aggressive or outright evil \u2014 Scary Scorpions sees far fewer inversions than Spiders Are Scary. Further, scorpions are often perceived and portrayed as more dangerous or powerful than spiders typically are. Thus, in much the same way that scorpions are sometimes used when something more dangerous or intimidating than spiders is needed, scorpion-based humanoids can serve as a more threatening or dangerous replacement for Spider People, and are more likely to be portrayed as aggressive or simply antisocial. This disparity may owe itself to the real-life fact that scorpion stings tend to be more painful and dangerous than spider bites.\nRegardless of how they're used, they appear most often in desert-themed settings, usually ones inspired by the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East or by Ancient Egypt.\nOverlaps with Our Centaurs Are Different when the scorpion person specifically has a human torso on a scorpion's body. Compare Big Creepy-Crawlies, which are nonhumanoid giant arthropods.\n"}
{"InternalMonologue": "The character's thoughts are dubbed into the soundtrack, often with a slight reverb. This can be milked for comedy if the character switches from inner to outer monologue accidentally.\nSee Inner Monologue Conversation for the frequently used subversion when other characters hear what is said and reacts to it or refers to it in their own thoughts, even though they shouldn't be able to. It's mostly used when two characters use this device in the same scene.\nIf the character intentionally says this \"out loud\" to an empty room (the audience), then it is Thinking Out Loud.\nCompare with Narrator, Captain's Log, and Sounding It Out. A specific example is the Private Eye Monologue. Contrast Surrogate Soliloquy, when the thoughts are forced out at an inanimate or nonsentient target to avoid voiceover. A closely related Video Game trope is Informing the Fourth Wall. May lead to Inner Thoughts, Outsider Puzzlement if you either spend too long monologuing or start acting weird while you're concentrating on your own thoughts.\n"}
{"JerkassStu": "Not every Mary Sue can have the patience of a saint. After all, if you were that perfect, lesser beings would get on your nerves too. Everyone falling in love with you? It's such a pain! People not always realizing that you are the most kick ass person here and you have to be the one to save the day? Fools! People expecting you to follow the same rules as the other characters? You'll show them! Grr! Get out of Jerk Sue's way!\nThe basis of this trope is the tendency of many Darker and Edgier writers to create a bitter, ill-spirited, confrontational, or downright mean character and still play them up as an ideal person, or just get away with being a bullying Jerkass. The other characters tolerate the antics (which can range from petty to sociopathic), allowing him/her to walk all over them and talking them up in their conversations with each other. Common synonyms include \"strong\", \"tough\", and \"rugged\" while common topics include how much better they've made their lives through their \"Tough Love\" or whatever Freudian Excuse supposedly justifies their behavior. It's often an unsuccessful or inept attempt to play on Jerkass Dissonance.\nPerhaps they are loathed so much not just because they are jerks, but because you are also expected to think they are awesome. They certainly come with most of the other traits of Mary Sueness - being completely untouchable in every way. And of course, despite being a jerk, everybody either completely ignores her appalling attitude, or lets her walk all over them, even the ones who would normally peel off her skin and wear it as a coat for that kind of behaviour. Either way, they're royal pains in the neck and annoying to be around and read about.\nVery prone to It's All About Me. Contrast to Butt-Monkey or Can't Get Away with Nuthin'. Both this and the latter tropes usually represent the two opposite ends of Comedic Sociopathy.\nCompare Draco in Leather Pants, when it's the fanbase itself that overlooks or all too easily excuses a character's jerkish habits, or Creator's Pet, when it's the writers doing it and the fans despise the character as a result. Either of these can overlap with Jerk Sue.\nCompare and contrast Jerkass Woobie, where a Jerkass is portrayed sympathetically as a flawed, emotionally fragile character. The Jerk Sue can often arise from a failed attempt at this type of character.\nOften overlaps with Karma Houdini.\nNo examples, please. This only defines the term.\n"}
{"EveryOneDies": "When Anyone Can Die becomes \"Everyone Will Die\".\nMany series are noteworthy for the extremely high body count among the main cast that they rack up in their last few episodes. In some cases, all of the heroes make a Heroic Sacrifice, or otherwise find themselves wearing the Red Shirt. Occasionally, the protagonists simply fail to prevent The End of the World as We Know It, resulting in a Downer Ending. (Possibly Dying Alone to cap it all.)\nCompare Everybody's Dead, Dave, where everybody except the main characters are dead. If just one person survives, it's Sole Survivor or Final Girl. Compare the Climactic Battle Resurrection. Also compare the Bolivian Army Ending, only we actually see the attack of the Bolivian Army. Also see Dwindling Party, where the cast is killed off one by one from the start. When a Sudden Downer Ending is planned from the start, it usually happens this way.\nUsually, however, either they accomplish something in death, such as killing the Big Bad and thus preventing The Bad Guy Wins, or it becomes clear that likeable as they may be, the world is better off without them, or their deaths are clearly an escape from a Fate Worse than Death. If none of these happens, and they prove completely ineffectual in both life and death, it's a Shoot the Shaggy Dog ending.\nIn a Prequel, they may be Doomed by Canon: all characters who do not appear in the sequel and can not be disposed of otherwise will have to die.\nIn Tabletop Games, this is called a Total Party Kill. Game Masters who are really annoyed with their group (or just sadistic) may invoke Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies.\nA short historical digression: the words \"Caedite eos, novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius\" (Latin: \"Kill them all, for God knows which are his,\" popularly rendered as \"Kill 'em all, and let God sort 'em out.\") are attributed to Abbot Arnold Amaury before the massacre of B\u00e9ziers during the Albigensian Crusade \u2014 albeit not in any of the numerous contemporary accounts of it. This was only attributed to him twenty years later as something he \"reportedly\" said.\nThe Trope Namer is Yoshiyuki Tomino, the Gundam creator who was given the nickname \"Kill 'Em All Tomino\" because of his reputation for producing anime where he kills off a large number of characters, often due to bouts of depression in his own life.\nThe funny thing about this particular trope, however, is that knowing that everyone dies is somehow much less spoiler-ish than knowing that, say, only your favorite one does. The wonders of perception... as some guy once allegedly said, \"The death of one man is a tragedy; the death of millions is a statistic.\"\nSee also Suicide Mission, Gotta Kill Em All, Final Solution, and Omnicidal Maniac (for whom \"killing 'em all\" is his goal). Contrast Everybody Lives.\nNot to be confused with the 2012 martial-arts movie Kill 'Em All or Metallica's debut album.\nNote: This is a Spoilered Rotten trope, that means that EVERY SINGLE EXAMPLE on this list is a spoiler by default and most of them will be unmarked. This is your last warning, only proceed if you really believe you can handle this list.\n"}
{"BadEnd": "(\"Good Ending\" redirects here. If you were looking for the manga series commonly known by that name, you'll find it under GE - Good Ending.)\nMultiple Endings are the most commonly seen form of Story Branching in video games, used primarily to increase their Replay Value, especially visual novels, role playing games, Survival Horror, dating sims, and fighting games. Different strategies or levels of skill in play will result in different endings, rather than all leading to a single predetermined conclusion. Generally, multiple playthroughs are necessary to see all the content, and possibly to unravel certain mysteries. What determines the ending usually involves the path one takes through the game (which can be as simple as choices the game gives in the prompt or as complex as entire alternate levels), whether one completes the 100% Completion, how well one plays the game (generally, scoring high is good and using continues is bad), other characters' Relationship Values towards you (including the Alliance Meter), and/or how high the player got the Karma Meter. Sometimes there are dual-optimal endings depending on which side the player chose to be on. (These can include the Forces of Evil!) The most diverse examples are found in Visual Novels and Dating Sims, including but not limited to:\nSome designers include truly \"neutral\" multiple ends, letting the player decide whether they're good or bad.\nThe major problem with Multiple Endings is that the sequel, should the developers decide to make one, obviously has to pick only one ending from which to continue the story \u2014 probably one of the good ones. This invariably occurs in adaptations to other media, such as novels, comics and television. Video games have the technical means to solve said problem with an Old Save Bonus, wherein the previous game's conclusion becomes the player's personal canon in the sequel. The other problem is that thanks to YouTube uploads, being able to view multiple endings no longer requires you to replay an entire game (perhaps in response to this, many games now have in-game rewards for getting different endings). Sometimes multiple endings require the player to do different actions or align themselves to different sides in order to see each ending, even if it means going against the main character's nature and goals to achieve it. This can make the story and characters look disjointed and confuse the player when they see the main character suddenly switching sides because of a few actions they did in a previous scene. When done poorly, having multiple endings can cause the player to have more questions than feel like the story is really resolved.\nOccasionally, the Multiple Endings are also couched with a non-linear plot \u2014 in which case, it can become frustrating-verging-on-impossible to find any of the multiple endings, especially if there are multiple \"threads\" in the plot.\nMultiple Endings are an effective way to avert Unstable Equilibrium. Instead of rewarding highly-skilled players with more power, reward them with less power, but give them a better ending if they can succeed. The opposite of Multiple Game Openings.\nContrast with Morton's Fork. Compare & contrast Multiple-Choice Future and Multiple-Choice Past.\nAs with all Ending Tropes, beware of spoilers.\n"}
{"WhyDidntIThinkOfThat": "Oh great, Alice is making one of her \"suggestions\" again, and Bob is just getting ready to deploy the mandatory response when Alice suddenly begins to make sense. \"Hang on!\" Bob says. \"That's a brilliant idea... why didn't I think of that?\"\nThis is when a character suggests something to another character that they wish they'd thought up, or are even surprised they didn't think up first. Despite the opening this doesn't have to be a previously dim or spacey character surprising a smart one (though that version may overlap with Dumbass Has a Point); simply suggesting something that in hindsight seems obvious can catch any character off guard. Compare Glad I Thought of It, where the character not only wishes they'd come up with the idea but tries to pretend they did come up with the idea.\n"}
{"NoBioChemicalBarriers": "In Speculative Fiction, it is far too often the case that writers do not take into account the fact that the differences between terrestrial species and their alien counterparts would run deeper than appearance alone. Given that alien species would have evolved in environments vastly different to terrestrial ones, contending with different atmospheric conditions, different levels of background and cosmic radiation, different soil conditions, different pathogens and parasites, and so on, it is patently unlikely that any aspect of their biology would be directly compatible with their terrestrial counterparts. Aliens in speculative fiction are usually depicted less as properly alien creatures and more like humans from another country, and alien animals are merely exotic species from a different climate.\nThis, then, means that you will often find one or more of the following in speculative fiction:\nSome of these are more plausible than others, although not by much. While there is reason to believe that Earth's atmosphere carries life because it is particularly suited to life, this is basically a confirmation bias \u2014 we consider it suited to life because it is suited to our life. This position is called the anthropic principle.\nSimilarly, some people claim that most life-forms in the universe would be fundamentally compatible with each other because they would be formed from the same basic chemicals. Considering that life on other planets wouldn't even necessarily be carbon-based,note\u00a0Most likely it would be, though. Its ability to combine with up to four radicals (hydrogen or other carbon-hydrogen-otheratoms molecule with a spare spot) allows the possible molecules to proliferate enormously. The vast majority of corresponding silicon molecules are unstable, except possibly when very cold. And when very cold, silicon and silicon oxides are solid, and can't mix to form the molecules. The proliferating molecules mean that the reproductive chemical would be most likely unrelated to DNA. this is a very naive position. Also, arsenic is one of those \"same basic chemicals\" as well.\nThis is one of the problems to watch out for in How to Invade an Alien Planet. A technological counterpart is Plug 'n' Play Technology. If different species (including, for example, humans and aliens) are shown reacting to drugs in exactly the same way despite biochemical barriers, see One Dose Fits All.\n"}
{"PoopingFood": "It probably goes without saying that the end product of most digestive systems is not exactly considered edible. note\u00a0Unless you are a bacterium or a similar organism.\nSometimes, however, one can come across a creature or whole species that defies this common knowledge and instead, they poop perfectly edible and perfectly looking food. Whether it's because of Bizarre Alien Biology or just plain magic, you can expect this trope to usually be Played for Laughs and for the sake of Rule of Funny.\nA subtrope of Toilet Humor. See also I Ate WHAT?!. Compare with Solid Gold Poop for less edible but still valuable waste products.\n"}
{"InterdisciplinarySleuth": "This character is an expert, trained in some field where crime-fighting is not a usual goal. They however use this expertise to catch criminals, probably alongside a more conventional Detective Drama hero (i.e., a police officer or private investigator).\nA subtrope of Amateur Sleuth. If the talent is magic, the character is an Occult Detective. Compare Superhero and The Exotic Detective. Contrast Mundane Utility. See also Mystery Fiction.\n"}
{"XanatosRoulette": "A convoluted plan that relies on events completely within the realm of chance, yet goes off without a hitch. If your first reaction to seeing The Plan unfold is \"There is no way that you could have planned that would happen!\", then it's a Gambit Roulette.\nA Gambit Roulette tries to make a character seem impressive, but can break Willing Suspension of Disbelief if not done correctly. You really have to establish a character as The Chessmaster for them to be able to pull this off without arousing your audience's skepticism. If the character pulling the roulette is a god, a person with precognition, a hyper-advanced AI, or someone else with similar abilities interacting with mortals, it becomes somewhat more believable, but even then, the suspension of disbelief can be tenuous at best.\nIf, as part of retconning in a new villain, everything up to then (including the supposed successes of the heroes against the old villains) is all part of a new Evil Plan, it's Arc Welding. Also often the justification of the Omniscient Morality License; their control over events is supposedly total. Many examples could be part of a Xanatos Gambit where it simply never became necessary to tell the audience about any other contingencies.\nMay be parodied by having events obviously (and blatantly) be out of the character's control, and yet still have them take credit for it.\nNote that complexity alone does not make a plan into roulette. A few separate plans may combine while individually making logical sense. When a dozen things are going on but the actual details of the plan aren't reliant on each item fortuitously fitting into place, then it's a Gambit Pileup. If the character has plans for either outcome, not just the improbable one, it's Xanatos Gambit. If they admit that they hadn't planned for certain occurrences, but took advantage of them as they came up, that's Xanatos Speed Chess. Contrast Batman Gambit which is based on the most likely outcome, based on the planner's knowledge of the people involved, rather than an improbable one. A roulette requires the planner to say that events that were literally impossible to predict were All According to Plan.\nThis is a Spoilered Rotten trope. Expect spoilers and avoid using spoiler tags unnecessarily.\n"}
{"ForeheadOfDoom": "Many animated shows, especially Japanese ones, have a habit of giving a character (sometimes more than one) an over-sized forehead. For some reason, the character, even if their head is their Berserk Button, will always have it prominently displayed. Especially if it is a visual indicator of their hard-headedness, figuratively or literally. It will often be drawn as exaggeratedly shiny and, like cue ball characters, a common gag is to have others be literally blinded by the glare reflecting off their dome. This type of forehead could also be emphasized with the right hairstyle. Compare the less realistic My Brain Is Big.\n"}
{"StinkBomb": "Sub-Trope of Trick Bomb, the Stink Bomb is a common item used by pranksters in school settings. In other settings, it's used as a distraction or a deterrent.\nThe most common variety are simply vials of either ammonium sulfide (which breaks down into several smelly gases on contact with air) or thiols (a range of hydrocarbon derivatives which smell unpleasant and evaporate quickly) which are released by rupturing them.\nDepending on how potent the smell is, a Stink Bomb can work as Knockout Gas.\nSee also The Other Wiki's article on this.\n"}
{"HotbloodedSideburns": "Hot Bloodedness isn't reserved just for people. It can be applied to many things \u2014 hair, for example. Large sideburns, muttonchops or earlocks are a variation on the Badass Beard, giving a character an especially grizzled appearance.\nIn the East, a short, fiery pair of earlocks is typically found on passionate Super Robot pilots and Sentai team leaders. While they don't have to be huge (though they usually are), they are always spiky and noticeable. Usually, they're paired up with some equally fiery eyebrows for added effect. Its inherent association with Super Robot shows of the 70s and 80s, this is also a form of Seventies or '80s Hair, and its appearance on female characters to show how badass they were has nearly died out. Its modern appearance on male characters is often in Homage to these earlier heroes.\nIn the West, larger sideburns and muttonchops have been considered fashionable during various times in history, including the 19th century, early 20th century, and the 1970s. Like the Badass Beard, the extra hair conveys strength and masculinity, indicating that the character is a hot-blooded and powerful individual. In modern times, particularly large muttonchops are considered retro or \"scruffy,\" so expect wearers to be more than a little irreverent and wild.\n"}
{"TrialAndErrorGameplay": "A popular variety of Fake Difficulty, Trial-and-Error Gameplay is what happens when a game developer decides the best way to punish a player's incorrect action is to kill his character, end the mission in failure, or otherwise force him to repeat that part from the beginning again. And, in the most egregious manner possible, this occurs whether or not it was even possible to know in advance that it was a bad move at all. In the end, the only thing the player can do about it is reload the area and/or savepoint, play through that section again, and remember not to do that next time. In essence, Trial-and-Error Gameplay is whenever it is necessary for the player to fail before realizing what is necessary to succeed.\nThis is not limited to Nintendo Hard games. It does not necessarily result from Everything Trying to Kill You. Even ordinary games can abuse the non-permanence of death. If it affects the game's plot, it may also challenge the Willing Suspension of Disbelief and Character Development, because when the game's protagonist finally breaks through, in-universe it looks like he just knew what was coming. It can feel much worse in games that have set pieces, voice acting, or (heaven forbid) unskippable cutscenes that do/say/show the exact same thing every time like a skipping record playing a song you can't get out of your head.\nTake heart. As annoying as this trope can be, it's far better than the game becoming Unwinnable.\nRon Gilbert of LucasArts fame rants about this trend here, and intentionally designed his games to avoid this trope (co-worker David Fox added that, unlike adventure games, \"I know that in the real world I can successfully pick up a broken piece of mirror without dying\"). LucasArts, it should be noted, became so opposed toward this trope in their adventure games that they often erred on the side of deathlessness. Others who've decried the trend include this IGN blogger and Shamus Young (of DM of the Rings fame).\nAlso known as 'Curse You Sierra', a lament directed toward the company most prone to putting such puzzles in their games. Save early, save often, and don't overwrite saves.\nAmusingly, in Edutainment Games or Puzzle games, trial and error may actually be the puzzle itself. These count, but barely, because you may not be punished for getting it wrong, since the entire point is Trial and Error until you get the solution right. There are also in fact entire games dedicated around this concept too, although to be fair, these games generally tend to give you clues after you make an incorrect guess.\nThis is much worse when combined with Check-Point Starvation. That said, it is possible to reduce the difficulty by watching and closely studying YouTube videos of it being done right. Or wrong.\nCompare Try Everything and Character Select Forcing. This trope is ubiquitous in \"Groundhog Day\" Loop stories.\n"}
{"TeenSuperSpy": "A hero with all of the style, panache and gadgetry of James Bond, the Teen Superspy exists to save the world (or maybe just the kids) from megalomaniacs bent on world domination. And he'll do it all without being old enough to have a martini. Or drive. And he'll still have to find time to do his homework.\nThe Teen Superspy is the implausibly young agent of secret agency. Perhaps she's been trained from birth for this role. Perhaps she's carrying the legacy of a missing or dead parent. Perhaps the government figures no one will suspect children of being secret agents. Perhaps they were just in the wrong place at the right time. Whatever the case, expect them to have an arsenal of high-tech spy gadgets disguised as typical teen paraphernalia.\nCompare Wake Up, Go to School, Save the World. Remove all the wish fulfillment and whimsy from this trope, and you'd end up with something closer to Child Soldier.\n"}
{"WeaponizedOffspring": "A creature, very often seen in video game boss battles, which creates smaller versions of itself or gives birth to attack its enemies. Sometimes there is an explanation, such as it being the queen of a race of Bee People or is the Mother of a Thousand Young, sometimes there isn't. Sometimes a monster will just spawn smaller copies and send them after the enemy with no other indication that it is actually female (sometimes it will be explicitly stated as male, on top of things).\nThis, in video games, tends to happen just to make the boss fight more difficult and/or annoying. Usually these characters have a seemingly endless supply of offspring to launch at potential attackers. It's probably worth noting that eggs don't need to be fertilised.\nNatural selection favors those who pass on their genes, which requires at least some of their offspring to survive long enough to reproduce. However, in the case of eusocial insects such as bees, ants, and termites, all but the queens and drones are sterile, so it doesn't matter if they die as long as it helps their mother survive long enough to produce fertile offspring that can pass on their genes.\nA sister trope to Tyke Bomb, and subtrope of Mook Maker and Abnormal Ammo. Daughter of Monster Is a Mommy. Related to Flunky Boss and Asteroids Monster. Also a subtrope of Living Weapon and Natural Weapon (since the ability to produce offspring is pretty inherent). Compare Doppelg\u00e4nger Attack, Proj-egg-tile. Contrast Spawn Broodling: this trope is about attacking or creating allies by giving birth; Spawn Broodling is about attacking or creating allies by making the enemy give birth. See also Drone Deployer.\n"}
{"TalkingToYourself": "Professional voice actors pride themselves on range. So, hiring a few good voice actors means you can take care of many, many characters with a small cast (especially if one or two actors are a Man of a Thousand Voices).\nOftentimes, this results in funny situations, like two characters played by the same person having intense conversations and heated arguments with each other. The talent is in making sure the audience doesn't know it. If jokes are made about this, it's Actor Allusion.\nSometimes this can happen in real life for technical or legal reasons where a person is required in one capacity to write themselves (in another capacity) a letter. For example, in most US states, for small corporations, a corporate officer can file an authorization to the board of directors to waive the corporation carrying workers' compensation insurance on that officer. Now, in the case of a corporation with a single owner (who therefore is both Chairman of the Board of Directors and President), the President of the corporation (who is the only officer) has to write a letter to himself, as Chairman of the Board, informing himself that he (as President) is waiving the Workers' Compensation coverage on himself (the letter being sent to the Workers' Compensation Board).\nIn voice acting, the process is fairly simple, with the actor just doing a different take (although some good voice actors can do it in real-time). The actor's vocal range is the only thing that might betray commonality.\nThis is sometimes actually invoked on purpose, as it can make you think, \"Ohey, they're a clone? Why didn't I realize that before?\".\nIn Live-Action this has historically been difficult, requiring split screen or otherwise splitting the image and requiring perfect synchronization between the different takes. Normally, the camera was stationary for this, but Back to the Future Part II pioneered a motion controlled camera that allows for complex panning shots that have the same actor in multiple roles. More modern works are able to do it a bit more easily due to advances in computer editing.\nSee also Solo Duet, where a singer does two different voices to make it sound like a duet, usually Played for Laughs.\nNot to be confused with Informing the Fourth Wall, Sounding It Out, Thinking Out Loud or Talking to Themself. Compare Holding Both Sides of the Conversation, which is an in-universe example of this trope, where a character is pretending to hold a conversation with another non-present (or non-existent) character, in order to maintain some kind of charade.\n"}
{"GoodGirlGoneBad": "She is adorable, sweet, nice, good-hearted... your stereotypical good girl. Until that fateful day. Abduction, murder, rape, any kind of violence. You name it. The nice, good girl goes through an event (or series of events) that changes her character and shapes her to the way she is now.\nAnd now she's a bad, bad girl.\nThey come in various different flavors. Sometimes they're simply an Ice Queen. Other times, they are worse. Many female villains tend to be good girls gone bad.\nSubtrope of Face\u2013Heel Turn. See also Good Bad Girl. May also relate to Used to Be a Sweet Kid.\n"}
{"ElementalEyeColors": "Eye color means many different things in fiction. Sometimes, they mean someone is special, or has powers, or perhaps just innocent. One of the common uses of eye color is to indicate a person's elemental affinity. The actual colour correspondence to elements varies depending on the work as different colours align with the elements depending on the work. It's more important that the colour lines up In-Universe than to any out of universe list.\nThis trope is frequently paired with its Sister Trope, Elemental Hair.\nAlso, compare Color-Coded for Your Convenience, Color-Coded Elements, Color-Coded Eyes, Technicolor Eyes, and Elemental Powers.\n"}
{"FanWank": "Fan Wank refers to a fan's personal theory about a work, designed to resolve inconsistencies or help make sense of the work, but tending only to reveal that the fan is putting way too much thought into the exercise. It's the other reason you should use protection when reading fanfic.\nFanfic writers like \"mythos building\" fics, partly because they tend to be more memorable, but also because they allow them to cement their personal theories into the source material's pseudo-canon; if the fans like the idea, they can collectively adopt it as Fanon. Fans may also try a Fix Fic, where the author identifies something \"wrong\" with the source material and tries to make it better. The problem with this sort of thing is that these fans tend to put much more thought into the work than the authors themselves did, and it results in theories that make no sense, don't make the original work any more enjoyable, or perhaps even resolve a question that was better left a mystery.\nParticularly common elements of a fan wank include:\nIf the canon author tries to do this to his own work, it's called a Retcon, Re Vision, or otherwise some form of Continuity Porn. In general, fans treat \"retcon\" as a value-neutral term, whereas \"fan wank\" carries a connotation of being crap. That said, fan wank can still be enjoyable, especially if the author is clearly aware of how ridiculous the theory is, and some fan theories can even be adopted by the original work in the form of Ascended Fanon (or a Shrug of God, which means no canon commitment either way and gives the fans room to work with).\n\"Wank\" originates in British slang as a term for masturbation. Thus, \"fan wank\" refers to writers stroking their own egos by writing at length about things only they care about. The term was coined by Doctor Who fan and Doctor Who \u2013 Expanded Universe writer Craig Hinton, who was no stranger to fan wank himself, and applied the term to his own work. That said, some fandom circles also use \"wank\" to refer to a fan behaving like a wanker, such as Broken Base feuding and other gross displays of Fan Dumb.\nThis is YMMV for a reason however, as the sheer amount of Fan Wank in existence shows that a lot of people, at least within fandoms, really like it.\nSee also Epileptic Trees (the specific crazy theories the fans come up with) and Wild Mass Guessing, TV Tropes' own collection of crazy fan theories.\n"}
{"UnwittingTestSubject": "This trope occurs when a thinking subject (a human, sapient animal, etc.) is part of a scientific experiment and has no idea that it's being experimented on and has not explicitly consented to the experiment. Usually, in such stories, there is some surreal and alienating moment in which the subject (or audience) realizes this after The Reveal, an unmasking or a series of clues in the story.\nUnwitting experimental subjects are entities that embody the experience of being caught up in a maze like a rat, being a guinea pig for the scientific-industrial complex and/or some mad scientist's eerie human experimentation, done for the sake of satisfying scientific curiosity. Subjects are unaware for a time that they're actively being creeped and experimented upon for a certain period of time. However, there could be copious amounts of unconscious subjects falling victim to Playing with Syringes or Strapped to an Operating Table, and maybe even the evoking of an Eye Scream. There's certainly overlap with They Would Cut You Up.\nExperiments like this are carried out by The Conspiracy, an Ancient Conspiracy, The Syndicate or The Government who have their own inscrutable motives. These bad boys might, in turn, have a Chessmaster who plans and runs it, making sure all the while that the unwitting subjects remain so. Sometimes one of the test subjects turns out to be working for the bad guys, in which case, the conspirator participates in a masquerade to keep his or her true intentions from the subject(s).\nThe difference between an Unwitting Test Subject and Tested on Humans is that with the latter some sort of weapon or destructive device is tested on a subject for show; for example, to humorous effect, just as a more or less random target to demonstrate how awesomely powerful a weapon is. A person who's a victim of Tested on Humans pretty quickly notices that s/he's the test subject, that is, the effects are immediate and plain to the subject/victim. Unwitting experimental subjects, in contrast, show up many times in the psychological horror or psychological thriller genres.\nThe experiment doesn't necessarily have to actually be shown to be an experiment. The story could be an Ontological Mystery, which the character is faced with after You All Meet in a Cell or You Wake Up in a Room. That is to say, the work might not have any visible scientists (to the audience or to the characters) who are performing the experiment, the purpose of the experiment may not be apparent or it may not be clear that it's an experiment at all. It could just be hinted at by various means (say, by the mathematical or vaguely scientific nature of the environment the characters find themselves in), or just implied in some clever way.\nOn the Older Than Feudalism level, this trope could be placed in the God testing Abraham's and Job's faith arena. The trope has been active since the '30s mostly in sci-fi works but shows no signs of becoming discredited.\nContrast Professor Guinea Pig, compare Guinea Pig Family. May involve a Disposable Vagrant or Condemned Contestant and an Evilutionary Biologist. If the humans are seen as a vast philosophical computer simulation, then compare with the Wetware CPU.\n"}
{"EasterSpecial": "Special television shows made for Easter.\nNote that this is a much smaller genre than that of the Halloween Special and Christmas Special. Easter Sunday is actually the most important holiday in the Christian calendar, as it celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion and the salvation of believers his sacrifice on the cross allows. But compared to the heartwarming story of the birth of Christ, which can be easily sanded of its darker plot points (i.e. King Herod's slaughter of the firstborn) for the masses and particularly children, the Easter story can't be effectively told without bringing up the death of Christ, the result of betrayal, denial, corruption, and brutality. And while secular/non-Christian audiences can appreciate/enjoy the \"peace on Earth\" sentiments of the Nativity tale, the Easter story is potentially alienating as it presses the idea that only those who believe in Christ can be saved from darkness. Thus, specials depicting the Easter story are usually aimed explicitly at Christian audiences.\nUnlike Christmas, Easter has not inspired much secular imagery beyond the Easter Bunny, candy, and colored eggs, severely limiting a writer's options for Easter stories for the masses. As an A.V. Club Inventory article examining secular Easter entertainment pointed out back in 2012, Easter \"seems to get tired spins on leftover ideas from other holidays\" (as with how the linking thread of It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown recycles that of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown), particularly reskinning Santa Claus tropes for the Easter Bunny.\n\"Sunday best\" clothes and a visit to church might be in the cards for human characters, but some secular specials don't even mention the holiday, instead focusing on kids and/or Funny Animals celebrating springtime.\n"}
{"EggMcguffin": "Sometimes, an episode of a series may involve a character discovering an egg of some sort which later hatches. Occasionally, the protagonists may save the egg from a terrible fate: either from being smashed or from being something or someone's lunch. The egg eventually hatches and the character gains a Pet Baby Wild Animal.\nUsually the baby is a Small, Annoying Creature (though it may actually be a gargantuan creature with the mind of a small annoying one) that thinks the first person (usually the discoverer) it sees is its \"mama\". Usually the baby may be far too much for the character to handle and they have to somehow find its real parents. A common variant has the egg hatching into something evil.\nThe trope can get even more unusual when the resulting offspring ends up taking on the characteristics of the hatcher, rather than who actually contributed to the genetics.\nIf the plot revolves around the unknown origin or result of a different kind of egg, it may be Who's Your Daddy?. Technically speaking, this is basically what happens in any mammalian or internally fertilised species, where legions of sperm race each other to get to the ovum.\nA frequent cartoon scenario has a Talking Animal, or more often a Speech-Impaired Animal, is trying to keep an egg warm without being interrupted or losing the egg in a offbeat chase scene. When the egg hatches, this often results in the (usually male) babysitter being referred to as Mommy.\nCompare Egg Sitting, where the egg is just a stand-in for a baby.\nDespite the trope name, the egg itself does not necessarily need to be a MacGuffin. The trope's name is a silly pun on Egg McMuffin, the breakfast sandwich.\n"}
{"ComesGreatPerks": "In fiction it's very common that a character's life drastically changes after they get superpowers. The first thing most people do (after dealing with the person bullying them throughout act 1), is strap on their shiniest cape or nicest dog-kicking boots and become the local hero or villain.\nNot this character.\nWhen this character gets superpowers, the first thing they do is... not much. They use their powers to marginally improve their lives, and simply do what they feel like. They don't (openly) care about the typical Good vs. Evil struggle (unless their mother gets kidnapped by the Evil League of Evil, or is staked by the local Knight Templar). Their behavior is probably how most ordinary people would act if they got superpowers. They aren't particularly mean, nor especially kind. They are just ordinary people given extraordinary powers. Often this is how characters in shows on the center of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism act before the plot shows up.\nIf there are other characters that have chosen to become heroes or villains, they (more often than not) will tell this character that they are either selfish or wasting their potential.\nWhile plot-wise most characters are given superpowers for the purpose of beating up other guys with superpowers, this kind of character (who might use Heart Is an Awesome Power in that case) can be used in Slice of Life situations and make a plot interesting without an antagonist that must be beaten.\nDiffers from Mundane Utility in that Mundane Utility is where a superpower can be / is used to enhance a character's every day life, whereas with this trope that's all their powers are used for.\nOpposite trope of Comes Great Responsibility and With Great Power Comes Great Insanity. Related to Cut Lex Luthor a Check and Chaotic Neutral (they tend to do whatever they want).\n"}
{"NonMammalianMammaries": "Look closely at a female reptile, a female amphibian, a female bird, a female fish, a female insect, or most non-primate mammals. You'll doubtless notice the lack of a particular characteristic that is common to female humans. Most animals do not have human-like breasts at all, even if they fall into the category \"mammal\". Compare the bellies of a male and female dog, or even the chest of a female gorilla, and you won't find much difference unless she's recently given birth to a litter and is nursing young (that's about the only time she will ever have any vague semblance of what we call \"breasts\" on humans). Both the size and position of human breasts are likely the results of bipedalism \u2014 or more likely, the longer infancy-period of humans in relation to other animals (see \"female gorilla\" above).\nRegardless of this, artists tend to oversize the mammaries of characters that do have them, or put them in places where they don't belong. Prominent breasts, or lack thereof, is one of the simplest instinctive visual cues for hominids. Giving all female animals big boobs, or at least a body shape that mimics them, allows for distinction between the sexes without adding glaringly obvious costume tags, a wasp waist, or the more bizarre gender-specific characteristics in some other animals that the audience may very well be unable to recognize as sexual dimorphism. In such works, male animals are not neccesarily given obvious pectorals. This can be said for most male cartoon characters, and not just male animals.\nIf the character is an alien or artificial life form, then it makes a little bit more sense. Aliens have Bizarre Alien Biology after all, and creators of synthoids and such would probably want their \"children\" to be anthropomorphic enough to fit in. Not to mention that it's easier to design a skin-tight rubber bodysuit with strange textures for use by human actors. However, it tends to make a lot less sense when applied to avian and reptilian races of creatures or aliens. Breasts are for nursing young, and for an Avian with a nice hard beak (especially those with curved or hooked beaks), that would be incredibly painful. Reptiles often have sharp teeth and often strong jaws, too, same with some fish. Remember, breasts are primarily for nursing young \u2014 not just to look sexy.\nThis is extremely common in the Furry Fandom, though some furries prefer to just portray a reptile, avian, amphibian, or their mythical cousins (Gryphons and Dragons) without them for anatomical purposes. Even when this trope is averted in canon, it seldom stops the Fan-Artists. There is also the school of thought of multiple breasts on aliens or furries, but that's a completely different subject altogether.\nJust in case male non-mammals feel left out, note that external genitalia and nipples are also a \"mammal thing\", and their presence in male creatures from other taxonomic groups is a variant of this trope.\nThis Trope is sometimes found with Non-Mammalian Hair, hair being something else that only mammals have but is often added to non-mammalian females. Compare Bizarre Sexual Dimorphism, Organic Bra, Multiboobage, Secondary Sexual Characteristics, Tertiary Sexual Characteristics, and Feather Fingers.\nComic Books\nWestern Animation\nFilms \u2014 Animation\nFilms \u2014 Live-Action\nLiterature\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWeb Comics\nWeb Original\nWestern Animation\nReal Life\nFilms\u2014Live-Action\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nVideo Games\nWeb Comics\nWeb Original\nWestern Animation\nFan Works\nFilms \u2014 Live-Action\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWeb Comics\nWestern Animation\nCard Games\nLiterature\nMusic Videos\nVideo Games\nWeb Original\nWestern Animation\nAnime and Manga\nFilms \u2014 Animation\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWeb Comics\nWestern Animation\nFilms \u2014 Animation\nVideo Games\nVisual Novels\nWeb Comics\nWestern Animation\nFilms \u2014 Animation\nFilms \u2014 Live Action\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWeb Comics\nWestern Animation\nFilms \u2014 Animation\nFilms \u2014 Live-Action\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nPrint Media\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWeb Comics\nWeb Original\nWestern Animation\nAnime & Manga\nFilms \u2014 Animation\n Film - Live Action\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nWeb Comics\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"YouGetKnockedDownYouGetBackUpAgain": "You're playing a video game and some enemy runs up and knocks you down. Normally, if this happened in Real Life, you'd expect to be more vulnerable to future attacks. But, for some reason, these cold, ruthless mooks appear to have the proper manners to wait for you to get back on your feet before they take another swing at you, making the time when the player is on their back a form of Mercy Invincibility. Just as annoying is when the player is forced into making the same concession.\nThis tends to be one of the Acceptable Breaks from Reality\u2014because, when it's averted, it can be really annoying. See Mercy Invincibility.\nTrope name paraphrased from the Chumbawamba song \"Tubthumping,\" for those of you who weren't paying attention to popular music in the late '90s. The line goes \"I get knocked down, but I get up again\" and the song is primarily about getting drunk.\nSubtrope of Mook Chivalry. Contrast Kick Them While They Are Down and Finishing Move.\n"}
{"GoroawaseNumber": "Numbers in Japanese don't have a single pronunciation: both kun'yomi (native Japanese) and on'yomi (Chinese-derived) readings are commonly used. Japanese speakers take advantage of these different phonetic readings, mixing them freely to produce mnemonic phrases to remember long numbers, such as phone numbers or entrance exam IDs. This device, called goroawase (wordplay), also can be reversed to convert many Japanese names or phrases into code numbers.\nGoroawase numbers are read digit for digit, with each digit arbitrarily assigned a kun'yomi, on'yomi or Gratuitous English reading, often shortened to the first syllable or phonetically modified. Here is a list of digits and their possible readings:\nMay overlap with Numerical Theme Naming.\nA Super Trope to One, Two, Three, Four, Go!, Seven Is Nana, Four Is Death.\nSee also Phone Word.\n"}
{"ParodyName": "Who knows how the idea got started that, when making The Parody, it is innately funny to replace each character's original name with a silly one that rhymes or sounds similar. But get started it did.\nThis does make sense from a certain vantage point. After all, if \u2014 for copyright and/or trademark reasons \u2014 a publisher can't use the characters' real names, they might as well replace them with something funny. However, some writers make the mistake of thinking that doing this makes their parody automatically funny. It doesn't. It may also be done to make it absolutely clear just what is being parodied since Viewers Are Morons. At its very worst, this is done when the writers don't know what they're parodying and thus making fun of the characters' names is the only joke they can think of.\nCan be combined with Parallel Porn Titles.\n"}
{"NobleConfederateSoldier": "The Civil War has been subject to a great deal of historical whitewashing. The South is commonly romanticized as a land of Southern Belles, wise old colonels, Good Old Boys, and Southern Gentlemen. So whether it be by actual Southerners, Hollywood filmmakers who don't want to alienate a market, or writers running off Popular History, the Confederacy, and the army in particular, gets portrayed in an unexpectedly positive light considering that they're the bad guys in American history class.\nThe Confederate soldier won't care about slavery. They fight out of duty to their state, right or wrong, and are noble, honest, and loyal. The officers will be Southern Gentlemen of the highest degree. The Confederacy might be presented as a tragic underdog. At the least, they will be a Worthy Opponent. Portrayals of ex-Confederate soldiers will show them as proud of their service, and will sympathize with their bitterness over losing the war.\nThere is of course historical basis for the trope of the sympathetic Confederate soldier. General Robert E. Lee was famous for siding with his state of Virginia despite wanting the Union to remain whole and being offered command of the Union army, and frequently gets cast in the role of Reluctant Warrior and Worthy Opponent in fiction. An examination of the surviving letters and diaries of Confederate soldiers reveals that many of them were indeed fighting for home and country, and rarely took slavery into account. Many came from non-slave owning homes, and never owned slaves themselves, so there's plenty of historical truth in this trope.\nThough real examples obviously existed, this trope is generally employed to avoid having to confront the uncomfortable nature of the South in the Civil War era, instead glorifying the Confederate military and glossing over the unpleasant parts.\nSee also Southern Gentleman, My Country, Right or Wrong, and Worthy Opponent.\nComic Books\nLiterature\nLive-Action Television\n"}
{"ActionSeries": "A series based on Action and Adventure. Morality is often very black and white, plots very linear. The Hero is generally not formally involved in law enforcement but often find themselves battling evil and/or criminals. Vigilantes are common.\nSimilar to the Adventure Series however with greater emphasis on violence, fighting, and car chases.\n"}
{"ElementalNation": "This is when the process of defining nations in fantasy settings is to have each group be under the domain of one kind of magic. The main appeal to this is, naturally, the easy convenience of being able to define who is from what nation, since they'll have the appropriate elemental affinity to go with it, and the trappings of the culture itself will be clearly delineated by that element as well. This is often paired with tropes like Single-Palette Town in order to get the full effect. On the downside, this can sometimes result in a Planet of Hats situation on a small scale, since all members of a specific nation must, by definition, fit into the general archetypes of their nation's element.\nTaken to extremes, the nation can fall prey to the problem of Poor, Predictable Rock.\nCompare Elemental Plane, for when the physical location itself is elemental in nature. Naturally, there is often a lot of overlap.\n"}
{"OurDwarvesAreDifferent": "'Dwarves': you know what they are. Gruff, practical, industrious, stout, gold-loving, blunt-speaking, Scottish-accented, Viking-helmed, booze-swilling, Elf-hating, ax-swinging, long-bearded, stolid and unimaginative, boastful of their battle prowess and their vast echoing underground halls and mainly just the fact that they are dwarves.\nEver since J. R. R. Tolkien raided the Norse myths for good stuff, almost every fantasy world has included them... and most of them have stuck closely to the original. Tolkien's importance to this can be gauged by the fact that the plural form dwarves, which he used to distinguish his dwarves from other dwarfs, note\u00a0It was originally a recurring mistake during the writing of The Hobbit (or rather \"a private piece of bad grammar\" that sneaked into the text), but it quickly became an Ascended Glitch. is now regarded by many as the standard plural (at least regarding fantasy \u2014 \"dwarfs\" is still the accepted plural for humans with dwarfism). Fantasy writers who use \"dwarfs\", like Terry Pratchett, are now the unusual ones. note\u00a0There is a small group that contends that the proper plural should be \"dwarrows,\" as \"dwarrow\" was the word from which \"dwarf\" originated. Linguists are quick to point out that that has never been a word used in modern English and its use is considered, at best, very non-standard. (Many \"Tolkienesque\" dwarves, however, are more like the Theme Park Version.) Since The Film of the Book(s), they now even all talk the same. A lot of dwarves are Scottish (or northern, rural, English, whose accents can sound indistinguishable from Scottish accents to most people), Irish, or Russian (oddly, despite the strong Norse influences, dwarves with any sort of Scandinavian accent are extremely rare in fiction). An entire race of miners and blacksmiths, with names like Dwarfaxe Dwarfbeard and Grimli Stonesack, who are overly sensitive about any perceived slight, always spoiling for a fight, unable to speak two sentences in a row without calling someone \"lad\" or \"lass,\" and possessed of a love of gold and jewels that drives them to live in Underground Cities where they dig deep and greedily (often with catastrophic results).\nIn the decades following Tolkien, they will often be depicted as more technologically minded than other fantasy races, verging on (and sometimes overtaking) Steam Punk, but this is in keeping with their engineering and crafting skills both from the classic Fantasy depictions and from actual mythology. Their societies tend strongly toward a Reasonable Authority Figure (usually a warrior king) ruling over a socially conservative but rather egalitarian society of soldiers, miners, and craftsmen. In most settings, dwarves and humans have enough in common to treat each other with respect. They are frequently allies against outside threats.\nThe dwarf will often serve as The Big Guy of a fantasy Five-Man Band, especially since his Weapon of Choice tends to be either an axe or a hammer. Ranged combat is not their preference, but if they aren't able to force enemies into close quarters, you can expect guns (Fantasy Gun Control permitting), throwing axes, or crossbows - in about that order. Dwarf rogues are rather uncommon in fiction, as their stocky frames make sneaking around look unconvincing, and their culture values honesty and openness; however dwarfs will usually know a thing or two about brawling and fighting dirty, which overlaps with the rogue archetype. Likewise, dwarven mages are vanishingly rare. In fact, it's not uncommon for the entire race to be at least somewhat magic-resistant. If a dwarf wants to use magic, he'll infuse it into a sword or an axe so he can physically beat the enemy with it instead. If legends speak of an Ultimate Blacksmith from a bygone age who once forged all manner of powerful enchanted weapons and equipment, then he was probably a dwarf. If you happen to come across any of this legendary equipment and discover that the centuries haven't been very kind to it, then the only guy in the world who can help you get it back into fighting shape is probably a dwarf too.\nOften they get treated as a functional One-Gender Race; one of the only widespread (but not universal) novelties is what the women look like. Even then, the most common ones seem to veer somewhere around \"Grandmother from The Old Country\"/\"adorable\" (depending on age) or \"you're looking at one now\" (with the Girls with Moustaches that implies).\nAn exception to this rule is the fantasy setting's Cutesy Dwarf, who is often based on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs; this variety shares traits with our kind of Dwarves, but will be less of a tough guy and more of a charming man-child, and will scrap the ale-drinking and ax-wielding to focus on craft and mining.\nSee also Five Races. Not to be confused with Little People Are Surreal or Depraved Dwarf \u2014 once again, dwarves are fantasy creatures; dwarfs are short humans (except in the Discworld and Warhammer), and nowadays the polite term for the latter is \"little people.\"\n"}
{"Sociopath": "The Sociopath is far from your ordinary criminal or villain. Combine a willingness to cross the Moral Event Horizon without a shred of guilt, a keen sense of other people's mental and emotional fault lines, and a Lack of Empathy, and you have the consummate evildoer.\nThe Sociopath displays these following qualities:\nUnder such circumstances, high-functioning examples will obey social norms to the extent necessary to sustain their hedonistic lifestyle while more low-functioning examples will react with unrestrained hostility towards anything resembling a challenge to their \"freedom\". Likewise, sociopaths are incapable of acknowledging personal responsibility for any failures or disappointments they encounter (i.e: events which they automatically attribute to those out to \"keep them down\" or unfortunate twists of fate entirely beyond their control).\nMany of these traits are shared with other disorders, but it's the combination of them all that creates the true Sociopath. And, like many other disorders, sociopathy falls on a spectrum. Some sociopaths are just unusually self-absorbed. On the other end of the scale are the ruthless, remorseless and totally insane monsters. Sociopaths also have varying levels of intelligence, and goals, which influences how their disorder manifests in everyday life. Some sociopaths just want a family - but the very best, most happy family, and only to reflect well on them and make them happy. At any cost. For example if another family member is 'spoiling' this dream, they may simply dispose of that person, and lack empathy and can't see why they might be at fault.\nThe high-functioning Sociopath will usually have better-than-average impulse control for someone with their condition, and may actually appear perfectly normal for years. They know murder is bad because they're told it's bad \u2014 and know murderers who are caught will get in trouble \u2014 but the action has no more emotional weight to them than brushing their teeth. They emulate the moral behaviour of society only because a failure to do so has negative consequences, and not because Good Feels Good. What You Are in the Dark exposes them for who they are, and they do not consider something wrong if they do not get caught. If killing advances their goals more easily and they can get away with it, they will often do so. And they will often seek positions of respectability within their communities in order to maintain the fa\u00e7ade of being just like everybody else.\nThey might even go their whole lives appearing almost normal... but there will always be something a little \"off\" about them; something cold and distant and fake. And they won't even care. This type can make a terrifying Knight Templar, liable to believe that Utopia Justifies the Means \u2014 some sociopathic serial killers claim they are simply a Necessary Evil removing undesirable elements from society or making a political statement. They may understand intellectually that their actions are undesirable in society at large, but feel that they should be rewarded, not punished, for acting to solve a perceived problem.\nThe low-functioning version is defined mostly by their impulse control being particularly shoddy, or having a personality type that predisposes them to violent behavior. For them, maintaining the fa\u00e7ade of \"fitting in\" is simply impossible, as their violent outbursts make them highly visible. But even a low-functioning Sociopath can be glib and charming, the perfect liar, allowing them to accrue loyal followers who perceive their behavior as revolutionary and secretly having a higher purpose. The sociopath will see these followers as useful pawns at best, however, and will not return any of their loyalty in kind, though they may pretend to when it suits them.\nNot all sociopaths lust for world domination, of course. Your every-day low-functioning sociopath may just want to get their next hit of crack, and not only will they go to any lengths but they won't feel bad about the distress they cause others by being an addict. Addicts do a lot to fund their addiction, but a non-sociopath will feel bad enough about it to eventually seek help to quit for the sake of others, while a sociopath doesn't give a crap. They're too great to overdose, they're not going to get caught (regardless of how little effort they put into not getting caught), and they don't get why others would get worried about what they're doing to their body or the whole family because they wouldn't care about them.\nOne important thing to note is that even family members and long-term 'friends' are not excused from these behaviors. Even their own children mean nothing to the Sociopath. They too are tools to be used and tossed aside as soon as they reflect poorly on the sociopath or get in their way. If a character cares about anybody other than themselves; if they can hesitate, they may be terrifyingly, murderously ambitious, but they have empathy for others, and by extension they are not a sociopath.\nIf the Sociopath has standards, there's a good chance those standards are either carefully calculated to manipulate others, or incidental to the sociopath's personality type. Often, their lack of emotional investment in any kind of moral code or ideology can strike a person with more typical psychological makeup as Blue and Orange Morality.\nThe canonical alignment for many Sociopaths is Chaotic Evil of the Type 4 variety, though some Neutral Evil examples exist under the Type 3 variety. Lawful Evil Sociopaths are possible.\nThe Sociopath has become a very popular villain-type in recent years; crime dramas and thrillers, for example, will inevitably feature one as a particularly merciless and evil antagonist. Some tropes that are frequently associated with The Sociopath include Serial Killer, Faux Affably Evil, Lack of Empathy, The Unfettered, Manipulative Bastard, The Chessmaster and The \u00dcbermensch. Many Psychos For Hire, The Soulless, and believers in For the Evulz are this as well. If the Sociopath happens to be a ruler, and considers themselves above the law, then expect them to be The Caligula. If a character qualifies as a Complete Monster, there's a good chance that this trope applies to them. Compare Sociopathic Hero, Comedic Sociopathy, Moral Sociopathy. Contrast the Narcissist, who has the grandiose ego and Lack of Empathy, but experiences the full range and intensity of human emotion, and is capable of love \u2014 even if it's a very one-sided, selfish kind of love.\nThe trope is named following an old edition of the DSM which used the term to refer to what is now classed as Antisocial personality disorder. Though the terms sociopathy and psychopathy are still recognized in some circles, they have no official standing. See Analysis and UsefulNotes.Lack Of Empathy for more detailed information.\nNote: very few fictional sociopaths \u2014 even the ones identified as such by the work itself \u2014 would be considered as such by a real-life psychiatrist. This is because, as Robert Hare points out in his book Without Conscience, sociopaths by definition are two-dimensional characters, lacking an ability to have anything resembling Character Development (not to mention that people who have the full range of human emotions may find it near impossible to conceive of a human being that truly lives without them). The biggest indication that a fictional character may score high on the psychopath checklist is antisocial behavior (whether violent or nonviolent) coupled with their loyalty or affection to other characters being dubious at best. So if a character has a Morality Pet, Morality Chain, or a deep attachment to a family member or leader that goes beyond simple practicality, it's a good bet this trope doesn't apply to the character.\n"}
{"NewGamePlus": "New Game Plus is the option of starting a new game by accessing a previous finished game, allowing you to start with improved stats, new costumes or items won beforehand.\nThe main reason for this can be so the player has a shot at things like multiple pathways and Multiple Endings. Indeed, playing through the game twice or thrice may be the best way to power up so you can face the Bonus Dungeon. A more basic reason is getting over the initial \"hump\" of the First Town playthrough. Another possibility is making the hopeless boss fight at the beginning of the game anything but, and getting a nice bonus reward for beating the Final Boss Preview. Plus it is always nice when you don't have to kill yourself playing a game to make the character the badass hero that they are supposed to already be. It also can be very satisfying when you can walk up to the character(s) who had you tearing your hair last time and crush them like a bug on a windshield.\nOf course, no matter how many special skills and items you can bring over to a new game, the characters almost never are able to remember the game's plot and fix any mistakes they may have made, or they are told that \"You Shouldn't Know This Already.\" You can also just pretend that New Game + mode is playing a new game while averting the With This Herring trope since you start off this time with much better gear. On the flipside, the early game becomes a cakewalk unless the enemies are beefed up accordingly.\nThis is named after the mode that is unlocked in Chrono Trigger.note\u00a0Where the majority of the game's multiple endings can be attained in this mode. It should be noted that while Chrono Trigger named this feature, the concept itself dates back at least as far as the The Legend of Zelda series.\nSubtrope of Macrogame and Post-End Game Content.\nWarning, there may be spoilers.\nFan Works\nLiterature\nTabletop Games\n"}
{"PuritySue": "The first Mary Sue archetype to gain wide recognition, from as early as King Arthur's Galahad of the Sangreal. Incorruptible Pure Pureness is the theme here.\nA Purity Sue can be male or female without significant difference, but in all but the earliest incarnations there's a strong tendency towards the latter. It is a character that is intentionally made by the author to be overly positive. They almost never have any flaws that actually affect them in a way that truly matters, usually going for endearing traits such as \"clumsiness\" or na\u00efvet\u00e9, instead getting overloaded with overwhelmingly positive but largely passive traits (i.e. beauty, innocence, etc.). The character will usually be soft-spoken, have a pleasant voice, and be mild-mannered. Often, the traits verge towards the ethereal, with auras, non-human lineage, and other such things. She may be a Barrier Maiden or a Miko. note\u00a0 Although not all Barrier Maidens or Miko are Mary Sues.  And the narrative will almost always go out of its way to describe her as a virgin. Bonus points if her modesty and virginity are what set her apart from \"all those other girls,\" and/or has no real bearing on the story or her role in it.\nLike all Mary Sues, she doesn't do enough to justify the positive response. And as usual it's the writer's fault. A character who would come off as wise and pure in the hands of a better writer, motivating the main characters in their down-time, turns into a smiling ditz who manages to convince people to do the right thing just because we are informed that she is wise and pure, and somehow she is the main character. She's usually cast as a passive motivator of other people, inspiring them to strive towards the author's goals by her very presence alone. Oh, sure, she might smile, offer encouragement, write articles, and other such things, but she gets such a disproportionately positive response that it soon breaks the Willing Suspension of Disbelief.\nShe often overlaps with a Fixer Sue. Almost never truly overlaps with God-Mode Sue because her overwhelming righteousness is usually the focus of the story and not her objective actions. Anti-Sue, Jerk Sue and Villain Sue are all antitheses to this character type (especially the last, since she's always a protagonist). This is the type that most often shows up as a Parody Sue.\nWhen considering if a character that overlaps with one or more of the other types belong here, keep in mind that Purity Sue pretty much exists to be loved by everybody for being (as the plot tries to suggest) \"perfect\" (or close enough) in every way that matters. If it's less about the character's actions and more just about everybody's fascination with the character, it belongs here. Note that merely being a Yamato Nadeshiko, Proper Lady, or The Woobie does not make one a Purity Sue.\nModern male Purity Sues are uncommon, but they're much more common in historic shows and texts. They tend to fall into four categories:\nSee also Mary Sue Classic, the fairly specific and extremely common plot format that uses this character type exclusively. This trope, along with that framework, is the oldest (widely accepted) form of Sue, being Older Than Steam and probably (depending on whether you believe Galahad was a Christ figure) Older Than Print.\nNo examples, please. This only defines the term.\n"}
{"SideQuest": "A sidequest (or optional quest, side mission, etc.) is any part of a video game that is not required to complete it. Sidequests come in a variety of forms, and completing them generally brings reward to the player such as additional equipment or abilities, areas to explore, supplemental plot related details, or fun unlockables.\nGoing out of your way and completing all sidequests results in 100% Completion.\nSome sidequests such as the Bonus Dungeon and Bonus Boss may provide challenges more difficult than any content available through the main storyline. This allows more casual players to still complete the game and see the plot resolved, while also giving gamers seeking an additional challenge something to go after.\nIt is important to note that this appears in practically every game which gives the player even a slight amount of free rein, and is one of the best way for a developer to add more content and extend the length of a game. If sidequests take up the majority of the game, it may be a Wide Open Sandbox.\nIn a lot of post-World of Warcraft MMOs (and games inspired by it), most sidequests fall into the Big Five templates: Kill Questsnote\u00a0\"kill a certain number of certain mobs\", Fetch Questsnote\u00a0\"bring me a specific thing\", FedEx Questsnote\u00a0\"deliver this thing to another place\", Collect Questsnote\u00a0\"find a certain number of certain things\", often rolled into Kill Quests, and Escort Questsnote\u00a0\"guide this vulnerable NPC to another place\"\u2014i.e. an extra frustrating variation of FedEx Quests. As discussed by Extra Credits, the prevalence of the Big Five is often a result of the common view among game designers that the only purpose of sidequests is to justify in-story the endless combat grind gameplay.\nRelated to Irrelevant Sidequest, Loads and Loads of Sidequests, That One Sidequest, and Sidequest Sidestory. Compare with Wacky Wayside Tribe, a non-interactive version. Also see Easter Egg, Infinity +1 Sword, and Quest Giver.\n"}
{"Fanfiction": "If you want something done right, do it yourself.\nFan Fiction is a form of Alternate or Expanded Universe created by the fans of a work, rather than the work's original creator. Fan Fiction, or \"Fanfics\" as they are often called, are written for any number of reasons, such as:\nDue to the inexperience of many fanfic writers, fan fiction has gained a reputation for being a source of horrible, horrible writing. However there are fanfics out there that are INCREDIBLY good. Sometimes being just as good as, if not better than, the original work.\nFan fiction is often the place where Epileptic Trees are planted and cultivated. Expect many, many, many more fics to star the Ensemble Dark Horse than The Hero.\nSaying \"It was a fanfic episode,\" though, is not usually a compliment.\nAlthough fanfic exploded along with the Internet, it existed well before the Net did. Such luminaries as John Stuart Mill contributed unauthorized, original stories set in a fictional universe. Before medieval French troubadours were shipping Lancelot and Guinevere, the ancient Greeks were writing plays about relationships between characters in The Iliad. In Plato's Symposium one character complains that a play by Aeschylus got the characterization of Achilles and Patroclus wrong. Namely, that it got the Lover and Beloved dynamic backwards.\nNot all fanfic is written, though that's the most common form. It can be in any format that can tell a story. In Japan, manga doujinshi (amateur \"comic books\") are a common vehicle; and with the increasing ease of their production on personal computers, fan videos (ranging from anime series, to Star Wars) have also appeared.\nThe distinction between fanfic and original fiction, as we know it today, is largely created by modern copyright law; much of classical writing is actually \"fanfiction\" based on older sources. The major distinction between fanfic and a story inspired by another story is that the story a fanfic is based on has one or more \"official\" versions, usually owned by a company, a creator, or both. Thus, things like The Infancy Gospel of Thomas, a piece of biblical apocrypha featuring Angry!Uber!Baby Jesus, or variations on Arthurian legend where there is no Holy Grail and Lancelot's affair with Guinevere never happens, would not \"count\" by this definition.\nNo statement on the legality of fanfic has ever been given in American formal law or in its courts. Some argue that it's a form of copyright infringement; however, see \"Legal Fictions: Copyright, Fan Fiction, and a New Common Law\", and note the above precedents. The two most common arguments for fanfic being legal involve either implied consent \u2014 companies and authors have every right to enact a Fanwork Ban as evidenced by fanfiction.net's banlist but are mostly tolerant \u2014 or fair use \u2014 the non-profit, educational and transformative use of the work justifies its existence. The latter is the main argument that sparked the development of the Organization of Transformative Works, a fan labor advocacy site.\nAuthors often have conflicted reactions to fan fiction set in \"their\" universe, which sometimes leads to the aforementioned Fanwork Ban. J. K. Rowling has largely embraced Harry Potter fanfics, albeit with certain limitations, for example, and Tamora Pierce advises aspiring writers that fan fiction can be a good way to hone one's writing skills. By contrast, Sir Terry Pratchett acknowledged it exists and was cool about it, pointing out that everything works so long as people are sensible about it. He added two caveats: anyone doing Discworld fanfics shouldn't even think of doing it for money, and authors should take care not to put it where he might see it. George R.R. Martin, author of the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire, expressed his disdain for the practice, saying that \"creating your own characters is a part of writing.\" He's even gone so far as to threaten legal action should he become aware of any fan fiction set in the Westeros universe. In contrast, writer/journalist James Bow makes a rather firm case for supporting fanfics, pointing out that it forms a stepping stone towards creating your own characters and setting. As far as media businesses are concerned, reactions have ranged from Archie Comics demanding immediate removal to Paramount taking some of the better Star Trek fanfics and having them published in print books.\nIt should probably be noted that several big-name authors are themselves writers of fanfics. Both Stephen King and Neil Gaiman have written (for example) stories dealing with Cthulhu, Dracula, and Sherlock Holmes, and label these stories fanfics. Contributors to franchises such as Doctor Who such as Paul Cornell have often posted wholly unofficial stories to their blogs and websites, above and beyond their fully licensed scripts and novels.\nSome franchises \u2014 such as Star Trek \u2014 have actually turned fan fiction into a profit center by creating Tie In Novels. These books are usually penned by young and upcoming authors, often former fanfic writers, and represent an intermediate state between fan fiction and completely original fiction.\nIn the end, more and more media outlets are recognizing that fanfiction and other fan works are a simple fact of life. And as art imitates life, it's now possible to find \"fake\" fanfiction created as part of a marketing campaign. For example, the 2010 season of Showtime's United States of Tara introduced a new character, an artist who had created and published a comic book character named \"Princess Valhalla Hawkwind\". As part of the promotional buildup for this, Showtime actually created a \"fan site\" complete with fanfic, fan art, and fan video.\nSome fanfiction becomes well-known enough to influence other fanfics, which themselves influence more fanfics, and so on in a domino effect. This can and does result in the creation and perpetuation of fanon, when one author comes up with a \"cool detail\" and others blindly copy it without realizing it was her invention. Furthermore, characters can become Flanderized by the feedback loops of fanfiction, sometimes changing dramatically from their original form.\nOne problem with fanfiction is sometimes writers don't do their research even when it is very simple. A common occurrence is when an author from a country other than the original work's country of origin writes characters as if they are from their own country. An example is Harry Potter where non-British writers (particularly American) make characters act and think like an American would; this also happens vice versa as seen in Fifty Shades of Grey.\nEventually, this accretion of fan-born details and mutations turns into things that \"everybody knows\" about the series. Those new to or unfamiliar with the original material are frequently confused into believing that it obviously must be canon if so many people mention it, even \"facts\" of the Epileptic Trees variety. This is especially the case with series that have long runs and which gloss over details which are unimportant to the plot but are of interest to the fans and the fan writers.\nOne famous example of this is the manga/anime Ranma \u00bd, released well before the Internet became ubiquitous and when many fans had no easy access to the original source material. All manner of details \u2014 including the explanation of Akane's mallet as either a ki attack or as residing in a hyperdimensional pocket, her Flanderization into a \"psychobitch\", her lethal cooking (rather than being just bad), and the names and fates of the many missing mothers \u2014 were never touched on in the show but became standardized in Ranma fan fiction over the course of approximately a decade. The process was accelerated and exacerbated by the appearance of fanfiction written by people who had never actually seen the show itself and whose only exposure to Ranma was other fanfiction.\nAnother famous example is the Harry Potter fanfic The Draco Trilogy, which was apparently so widely read that details such as Blaise Zabini being female and Ginny's name being Virginia were taken to be canon, although they were both refuted by later books.\nIt's not surprising that fans of some shows occasionally pen FAQs solely to reduce the accumulation of fanon in this way.\nCurrently, the largest source of fanfiction on the Net (and probably anywhere else) is the aptly named Fan Fiction Dot Net, which as of 2013, offers approximately nine million stories across all but a select few canons (which were banned due to creator request) and an automated system for posting. A newer site called Archive of Our Own is starting to nip at Fan Fiction Dot Net's heels, though, with over 1.7 million stories and less restrictions on what can and cannot be posted. And to top it all off, in mid-2013, Amazon.com joined in the act with its Kindle Worlds program, which allows for the publication and sale (!) of fan fiction from specific 'verses.\nSee also Memetic Mutation and Shipping. For fanfic-specific tropes, see Fanfic Tropes.\nOf course, the hive mind have a few favorites. There are also a few favorite unfavorites, if that doesn't confuse you too much. Some here have even written a few.\nNote that since this is intended to be an index of fics with pages, a Red Link will be frowned on and given a very brief (week or two) grace period before being removed by your fellow tropers.

{"AlanFridge": "A Print Media Trope. Ever notice that whenever the papers or the mags have a particularly spurious rumor about a person, TV show, upcoming movie the source of this rumor is never named?\nThey are usually credited as \"our source\", \"an insider\", or, in the case of Celebrity Gossip, \"a friend of X\". Why is this person never named? It could be because these sources' jobs or friendships could be in jeopardy if they are named, or they could open themselves to libel suits or worse...\n...Or, with the sillier rumors, they've either been made up, or they are an \"<Insert Network Here> Insider\" insofar as the \"insider\" is a coffee boy or some celebrity's hairdresser or something.\nThe trope name comes from Outpost Gallifrey Doctor Who Forums, where, due to the above quote, Alan Fridge was a Running Gag in general, but especially when it came to the daft Doctor Who rumors that the British tabloids are known to print. It should be noted that it was a different poster who came up with the name Alan Fridge, but it was Steven Moffat who linked the name to the trope.\nAlso applies to some stories in newspapers on other subjects, e.g. defense.\nCompare: Alan Smithee and Could Say It, But.... Contrast Greg Packer.\nAlan Fridge, oddly, is not known for his logic, his brilliance, or his horror.\n"}
{"WrestlingMonster": "Is he out to win championships? Does he live to entertain the fans? Is it all about the money? No, all he cares about is destruction, preferably the destruction of other living things. His shadow stretches far, his footsteps fall hard, he strikes swiftly, his Battlecry being the only warning, if you're lucky. He's as strong as he is fast, as tough as he is agile, he's savage and is likely from Parts Unknown. He's a monster!\nSome monsters are too dumb to understand anything other than fighting. Some are reasonably intelligent if a little disturbed, criminally psychotic by most standards outside of the wrestling world. Some turn out to not be that bad, simply misled by a depraved manager, but these are bad for the reigning champion, as the manager can give them a focus they would otherwise lack. A monster's strength and fury can be fueled by external forces like medicine that had unintended side effects on him. Some claim to have supernatural powers, some claim to be beasts that only take the guise of men.\nWhat all monsters have in common is incredible endurance. They may be huge, but being big isn't enough. They may be crazy or vicious, but that still isn't enough. Many have power contested only by the The Giant or the World's Strongest Man along with the agility of high fliers, but to be a monster, he must also be insanely tough. Some will teeter but not fall. Others will always get back up. The worst seemingly Feel No Pain at all: move them, bruise them, cut open their bodies, but it will do little to slow them down. After all, reducing his selling is the easiest way to convince the audience this guy is abnormal.\nThe biggest thing that makes a monster different from The Giant is movement. Monsters are tough, but being unmovable is not nearly as important to their psychology as for giants. Monsters are also more likely to chase down fleeing foes than giants. Wrestlers will often be given giant gimmicks to emphasize their appearance while distracting viewers from their lack of talent. Monsters may lack in some areas of Wrestling Psychology or charisma, but the gimmick is usually given so a wrestler can spend more time showcasing their offensive moves without having to slow down too much to sell. The Wild Samoan is a subtrope.\nThe term \"monster heel\" is often used to describe this kind of wrestler, however, since monster gimmicks are usually given to talented athletes it is not unknown for them to take the face role. Depending on how abnormal the gimmick is supposed to be the face examples may overlap with Monster Knight.\n Anime And Manga\n Live Action TV\nTabletop Game\nVideo Games\nWestern Animation\n"}

The older character could be an Aloof Older Brother or Mentor figure, or it could be a villain taunting his young foe.\nDiffers from You Got Spunk in that the latter refers to a villain taunting the captured heroine (or hero in some cases), although the words \"spunk\" and \"guts\" are interchangeable in either context. \"Guts\" may also be substituted with \"balls\" in some works.

Another third-person variant is often used for Black Comedy following a particularly gory scene.\n"}
{"DecontaminationShower": "A standard for any setting where there's a chance of contamination, usually by an alien virus.

{"SuperGenderBender": "A character needs to undergo a complete physical sex change, usually through magic or Applied Phlebotinum, in order for them to access their powers. It is used as a justification to give a gender change to a character who would not ordinarily want one.\nThis trope gives a new twist to the classic secret identity, as the character not only has to face the responsibility of having great power but also the hardships of living as a new gender.\nMight be used to (not-so-)subtly deliver An Aesop about how being yourself is greatly empowering.\n"}
{"NumbersStations": "\"Numbers stations\" are real-life phenomena that arose in the Cold War era and are far too bizarre for fiction to pass up on.\nSimply put, numbers stations are shortwave radio stations that broadcast long strings of numbers, usually read by a synthesized female (or occasionally male) voice. It is generally assumed that the numbers are messages encoded using the one time pad technique, sent by intelligence agencies to their agents in the field. No agency has acknowledged these transmissions, and decryption of a one-time-pad encoded message without the key is impossible. Mostly.\u00a0The susceptibility of an OTP-encrypted message to statistical analysis varies inversely with the degree of entropy, i.e. randomness, in the keystream. Since this weakness is a well known and elementary trait of the OTP algorithm, and can be overcome through the use of a high-quality entropy source, there's no reason to expect that it will exist in the keystreams used to encrypt messages broadcast via numbers stations. Further, anybody foolish enough to use a one-time pad for more than one message is probably going to get their message decrypted, as the strength of the One-Time-Pad system almost completely hinges on it being used only once.\nAside from their use in Spy Fiction, many works of fiction will try to explain these broadcasts as part of some secret plan by a government or other sinister organization, and the Conspiracy Theorist or radio hobbyist will be obsessed with decoding them. Beyond that, they can be used for the creepy effect of having a static-y radio with a lone automated voice repeating gibberish endlessly. One popular theory has it that the creepiness is their entire purpose: plant one next to a country you don't like, and their paranoid government will waste a lot of time and money decrypting total nonsense.\nThe Other Wiki has an article describing numbers stations in more detail.\n"}
{"WallPinOfLove": "It may not have been The Love Slap of Epiphany, but it does get the message out through and clear. Alice becomes more and more confused about how she sees Bob. Usually it results in a case of They Do.\nThis trope is better known to the Japanese public as the \"kabe don\" (wall pound). It's when a character (usually Always Male) physically corners a Love Interest using the body to block any chance of escape. It's often accompanied with a \"BAM!\" sound effect from pounding the wall (the \"don\" in kabe don). The Wall Pin Of Love is often Played for Drama and increases tension between the characters. It may be given with an Anguished Declaration of Love or a Forceful Kiss from the person doing the Wall Pin. May also lead to Wall Bang Her. A well-known parody of this originating in the Japanese Twitterverse was known as the \"semi don\" (cicada block), and was subject to much Memetic Mutation.\nThe Wall Pin of Love is a very popular staple in Shojo and Yaoi romance. Many news outlets have reported that it is the \"ideal\" scenario for many Japanese women. Despite this, the Wall Pin of Love can lead to Unfortunate Implications because the emotional and physical intimidation is common in domestic abuse. Because of how frequent and popular it is in Eastern works, there may be Values Dissonance involved in how it's accepted. People in the West are more likely to see the Wall Pin of Love as anything but romantic.\nOutside of a romantic context, the Wall Pin can simply be used to intimidate people. A Loan Shark might use it when he doesn't get his money. However, if it's simply a Neck Lift applied to a wall or shoving a person into the wall, then it doesn't count. The Wall Pin has to involve someone trapping another with the body. In less serious works, this may be Played for Laughs by having the victim assume they're being flirted with.\nUnlike Pinned to the Wall, this generally involves no pointy objects.\n"}
{"HeroProtagonist": "A Hero Protagonist is when The Hero and The Protagonist are the same person. This combination of roles is extremely common, to the point where it's considered true unless otherwise noted within any work. Simply put, the central character is also an established force for good within the universe. The Hero Protagonist is also a source of Escapism; the audience sympathizes with the character because he's who they want to be, rather than who they actually are. It's common to see Hero Protagonists tackle villains who either cause or are personifications of real-life issues, in order to fulfill the desire of the audience to see these problems dealt with.\nOn the other hand, these characters need to be treated carefully. Since the Hero Protagonist is the central character, the issues common in The Hero become very noticeable very quickly. Since it's inevitable that the character will win (usually), a lot of the drama in the story is removed. Good writing will therefore focus on how they win, or offer up an interesting character dilemma. Bad writing can turn the Hero Protagonist into an Invincible Hero. Several works avoid the problem altogether by averting the Hero Protagonist by having the two traits in different characters, or dropping one or both from the narrative completely. If The Hero is made into a supporting role, this allows them to be awesome and heroic without dragging down the narrative.\nA Hero Protagonist is most often found in works with Black and White Morality, where they will be opposed to the Villain Antagonist. This trope is easily one of The Oldest Ones in the Book, to the point where most of its aversions are likewise The Oldest Ones in the Book. For when The Hero is not The Protagonist, see Supporting Leader, Hero of Another Story and Hero Antagonist. For when The Protagonist is not The Hero, see Anti-Hero, Villain Protagonist and Supporting Protagonist. Not to be confused with Hiroaki \"Hiro\" Protagonist.\nAs this is an (almost) Omnipresent Trope, no examples please.\n"}

{"CastFromHitpoints": "You've just run out of your source of magic, whether it's Magic Points or other Phlebotinum, and you desperately need to cast a spell to save the day. What do you do? Spend your own Life Energy on the spell in place of whatever would normally power it. The spell is then Cast From Hit Points.\nThe cost of the life energy thus expended will vary. In extreme cases, a spell cast from HP may cost the caster their life, resulting in a Heroic Sacrifice; this is often done for the purpose of Taking You with Me. When done by multiple casters at once, this qualifies as a Combined Energy Attack. Lesser versions may result in a decreased lifespan, which is typically given in round numbers such as years. Whether this is cut from physical longevity or some kind of cosmic clock depends on the series. At its mildest, casting from HP leads to immediate physical effects such as fatigue or a Psychic Nosebleed. Casting from hit points in a way that causes irreversible/cumulative damage to the caster is Power Degeneration, while fueling a Super Mode from hit points is a Heroic RRoD.\nThe effects of this on the magic itself vary as well. A spell cast from HP may work normally, but more often than not the plot demands that the use of life itself must amplify the effect dramatically. If done well, this may represent the caster's Moment of Awesome.\nSome fantasy settings have this as their standard system of magic. In those cases, the process will typically exact a price significantly less than the life of the caster. Particularly common in settings featuring magic which has limits and obeys scientific (or pseudo-scientific) principles to some degree. A common form of the Dangerous Forbidden Technique if the costs are exceptionally steep.\nNot every spell used for Taking You with Me involves casting from HP. A parting shot may hurt the caster, but unless it is the act of casting that does this, it doesn't qualify as casting from HP. Usually, you can be healed after casting from HP \u2014 when there is no way to recover at all from the loss, it's Cast from Lifespan instead. When the sacrifice is of mental rather than physical health, see With Great Power Comes Great Insanity. A revival spell that harms the caster likely falls into Sacrificial Revival Spell.\nFor obvious reasons, this trope is particularly common for depictions of Blood Magic that just require blood and not death to function.\nCompare Living Battery, Cast from Calories, and Cast From Stamina. Polar opposite of Mana Shield.\nDo not confuse with Lovecraftian Superpower.\n"}
{"MacguffinSuperPerson": "A Living MacGuffin sought after for some supernatural ability or quality they have. Searching for the Apocalypse Maiden or Barrier Maiden is common, or perhaps they have some other power that would be useful, such as curing a disease.\nCharacters who are sought after due to their status go under Hostage MacGuffin. Characters with some mundane trait (beauty, intelligence, etc) that makes them a target go under Mundane MacGuffin Person, while ones who were originally literally objects go under MacGuffin Turned Human.\nOften a Person of Mass Destruction.\n"}
{"ThatOnePlayer": "That One Player describes someone who has played a game so much, discovered all the secrets, knows all the moves, hell, he might as well have gotten the timing down to the point where he plays with almost super human reflexes. However, this ruins the fun of everyone else who plays with or against that one guy because he's so skilled, he's either doing all the fun parts or able to take on an army of adversaries without breaking a sweat. However, sometimes being That One Guy can be a talent for entertainment, when he can show off his inhuman skills.\nThat One Player, though, may not necessarily mean a stop having fun guy or the other way around. Nor is he That One Boss, though if he was a boss, he would be. May possibly be a Challenge Gamer, which would certainly explain their ungodly skill. And chances are they are a munchkin, and their munchkinry is to blame for their annoyingness.\nSome video games have a \"handicap\" option to either make a certain player weaker or everyone else stronger, purely to keep That One Player from restricting other players' fun... or their own, for that matter.\nNot to be confused with The One Guy, a trope about one male character in an otherwise all female cast.\n"}
{"GoddamnedBats": "Weak enemies that exist primarily to annoy the player character. They probably aren't gonna kill you, but they're certainly going to harass you and slow you down, making it easier for something else to kill you.\nAlmost every video game has them. These are the enemies that are just a speed bump, even if they are not outright dangerous. They're not difficult to defeat, but because of the frequency with which they appear, they can become a significant hindrance to the player, and they usually don't give you enough of a reward to make fighting them truly worth it, either. Even the explosion made by killing them is paltry compared to other enemies.\nThey're the goddamn bats, man.\nA key trait is that they generally don't pose too large of a threat on their own; they're more annoying than deadly. When an enemy starts posing an actual threat, then it's a case of Demonic Spiders and, in extreme cases, the Boss in Mook Clothing.\nNote that this designation applies to any type of non-threatening enemy whose purpose is to stall and harass the player. Goddamned Bats are common in Platformers, where they enjoy disturbing precision jumping.\nThey don't have to be bats. The best definition of the Goddamned Bats trope is that they are not only common enemies that will swarm you, and they are not only pathetically easy to kill on their own, but they take no skill to defeat, in RPGs they don't provide much (if any) experience or gold when beaten, and are sometimes flat-out annoying. A famous example of this is Zubat in the Pokemon series which were found in nearly every cave in the first 4 generations and liked to inflict various Standard Status Effects on the player before going down.\nOther following factors can contribute to making an enemy a Goddamned Bat:\nOccasionally, Goddamned Bats can be a result of the setting; for example, a water level can inadvertently graft Goddamned Bats characteristics onto any enemy if the game has poor movement controls.\nThe Trope Namer is, well, actual video game bats. Bats in video games tend to have many the aforementioned traits; very common in caves and other dark areas yet are individually easy to defeat, their small size and fast movement makes them difficult to hit in real-time games (and turn-based games reflect this by giving them high evade rates), and since they fly the player is usually unable to hit them with melee attacks.\nSee Goddamned Boss for bosses with these characteristics. Compare The Swarm. For literal bats that God has damned, see Bat Out of Hell.\n Fan Works\nWeb Comics\nWeb Original\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"EvilNephew": "We know about the Evil Uncle. It looks like nephews in these families have a difficult time.\nBut don't think that uncles always have it fine. Sometimes they can be the ones who have trouble. This trope is for uncles who get badly treated, sometimes they are the Butt-Monkey, sometimes they are subject to avunculicide, the act of killing an uncle.\nThis can happen when the nephew is the one who succeeds to power and the uncle is still a member of court. But his nephew may be The Caligula and treat the uncle badly.\nOften associated with The Evil Prince.\n"}
{"EmergencyEnergyTank": "In many games, there are items that refill some of your health and energy. But sometimes, that's not enough. Sometimes, there's a special inventory item that completely refills your health and/or energy, as well as removing Standard Status Effects or even reviving a character from death. You'd better save it for the right moment, though, because once you use it, it's gone, and you'll have to find another one\u2014and there's often only a finite amount of them in the whole game.\nThis is the Emergency Energy Tank: the ultimate fully-revitalizing panic button. Whether locked in battle with That One Boss or desperate for healing in the Drought Level of Doom, the Emergency Energy Tank can give you a crucial second wind. Use it wisely.\nA very specific Sub-Trope of Too Awesome to Use and Healing Potion.\nCompare Auto-Revive, Heart Container, 1-Up.\n"}
{"Undead": "Dead folks who, whether due to dark magic, mad science, lack of a proper funeral or burial, some old problems they still haven't solved, a desire to get revenge on their killers or enemies, or just plain stubborn bloody-mindedness, do not rest in peace. Unable to move on to the afterlife, they still roam around in the mortal world, (poorly) trying to behave as if they're still alive.\nOne way undead vary is the nature of their mind, soul, and spirit. In some cases, including liches, most ghosts, and some vampires, they keep their original soul and personality. They can still remember the simple pleasures of life, but they can no longer experience them, a frustration which may fill them with hatred of the living, or simply make their existence an unliving hell. Heroic/sympathetic undead are most often from this category.\nIn other cases, including many traditional vampires and most zombies, the undead are actually animated by evil spirits or demonic entities. They may have access to the memory of the deceased person whose corpse they are wearing, but they are not truly the original person in question. These types are almost invariably evil, and are much more likely to be vulnerable to religious symbols and sacred rituals.\nThe remaining forms of undead may be little more than puppets of a Necromancer, or they may be powered by magic alone, but they have no animating spirit (at least, not a sentient one).\nSee the Undead Index to read more about all the related tropes; along with the Haunted Index, Tropes of the Living Dead, and Vampire Tropes. See also Night of the Living Mooks, Big Boo's Haunt, Clown-Car Grave, and Animate Dead.\n"}
{"TrueFinalBoss": "A hidden Boss Battle in a Video Game that shows up after (or instead of) the game's usual Final Boss battle, but only if certain conditions have been met. In terms of the narrative, they could be the regular Final Boss gone One-Winged Angel, The Man Behind the Man, a Greater-Scope Villain, The Dragon (having arrived late to the party), some side character nobody thought was important until right this moment, or (if the game is a fan of Mind Screw) a Giant Space Flea from Nowhere. Or maybe the regular Final Boss is The Dragon or a Giant Space Flea from Nowhere, and the Big Bad proper is the True Final Boss. Regardless of their identity, this is undoubtedly THE strongest, baddest opponent you can battle in the game (aside from maybe the Bonus Boss).\nExactly how to unlock this guy varies: It may be as simple as playing the game on a higher Difficulty Level, or it may involve achievements like a Speed Run, No-Damage Run, or some obscure Gotta Catch Them All Side Quest, or the boss may appear at the very end of an unlockable Boss Rush mode after the main story. Not every game will Foreshadow that this foe even exists in the first place or how to find him \u2014 Guide Dang It! \u2014 and sometimes even an official strategy guide will intentionally avoid spoiling this guy in advance. (But for that, there's always the Internet...)\nIf a game has Multiple Endings, expect the game's Golden Ending to be hidden behind this guy, especially if anything less yields only a Bittersweet Ending (at best) and/or provides little or no real thematic closure to the game's narrative. Outside of that, don't expect any tangible rewards for beating this guy, though.\nExpect an Oh, Crap! moment when a player unlocks this guy for their first time \u2014 bonus points if it happens while showing off their mad gameplay skills (or a Self-Imposed Challenge) to their nearby friends.\nContrast Post-Final Boss, which is an easier, post-climax fight that lets you cool down after the real climactic struggle, and Bonus Boss, which is an extra-hard secret unlockable boss that has no relevance to the game plot (or at least not to the immediate struggle) and only gives a Bragging Rights Reward for beating it.\nNaturally, the below examples are all spoilers. Read at your own risk!\n"}
{"CallAHitPointASmeerp": "As we all know, there are many conventions of video games, like Hit Points, extra lives, high scores, money systems, Energy Points, respawning, loot collection, and so on, which are almost universal.\nSome games, however, try to avoid some of these conventions because they don't fit in with the genre. For example, superheroes don't usually collect loot or use expendable items like healing potions, realistic characters don't function normally up until the brink of death and then suddenly die, resurrection doesn't exist in all settings, and lots of character types wouldn't use money to buy items. But what if the genre of game calls for something like that, or the designers want or need such a mechanic for balance?\nOne way to handle the issue is to keep the errant mechanic, but offer a simple (or not-so-simple) \"fluff\" explanation. Superheroes might collect \"flashbacks\" or \"trophies\" from defeated supervillains that act like standard loot; realistic characters might have \"Fatigue\" or \"Vitality\" that represents near-misses or luck; and death can be smoothed over as \"unconsciousness,\" with resurrected characters brought back to their feet by slightly more realistic restoratives.\nBe careful when employing this trope in your games. Using tasteful quantities of proprietary terminology can give the game a unique flavor that stands out, but overusing it can cause players to have to constantly refer to a guide just to figure out what all of your unique terms mean.\nThis trope has been around since the days of Dungeons and Dragons, usually by game systems switching up their terminology just to be not-Dungeons-and-Dragons.\nNamed after the trope Call a Rabbit a \"Smeerp\", which is when an in-universe concept has a silly name.\n"}
{"GradualRegeneration": "An item or ability used in recovering a small amount of Hit Points and/or Mana Points per a certain amount of time, or just increasing the effects of an already-existing regeneration mechanic. In games that are turn-based or have the passage of time marked by actions performed by the player, health or mana may recover based on turns or steps taken rather than in real time.\nMost Roguelikes let you recover HP and MP gradually over time without needing to do anything special, due to Hyperactive Metabolism.\nMay overlap with Regenerating Health and Regenerating Mana, if a Life Meter or Mana Meter, respectively, restores slowly, but not if there's spontaneous regeneration to the maximum, after a battle ends, for instance, as that's not gradual.\nMay also overlap with Healing Factor, a dramatic rather than a gameplay ability, when there is Gameplay and Story Integration.\n"}
{"MysteryArc": "The bases that must be touched in the traditional game of mystery storytelling. This arc is most commonly used in Mystery Fiction and Detective Fiction.\n"}
{"MixedArchetypes": "Many characters combine aspects of various archetypes to form more complex characterisations:\n"}
{"CutPhonelines": "Sometimes, the villains knows what the heroes are planning to do and where they will go. In this case, said villain knows when they will have access to a phone. So, to avoid having the police interfere, they will cut the phone line, often offscreen.\nFrequently a Horror or a Mystery movie trope. Since cell phones have made this largely obsolete, this is generally replaced by Cell Phones Are Useless in modern works.\nCompare The Radio Dies First and Lost in Transmission.\n"}
{"ObstructionistPacifist": "When a character or group is too utterly swept up in their own need of being a pacifist or making sure that everyone/anyone else is pacifist, to the point where it slightly or completely prevents the hero/party/group in progressing to their goal or weighs them down immensely.\nSub-Trope of Honor Before Reason. Compare Suicidal Pacifism and We Have Become Complacent. Similar to Thou Shalt Not Kill. May lead to Too Dumb to Live.\nAnime and Manga\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWestern Animation\nReal Life\n"}
{"GodEating": "The idea of cannibalism is one of the oldest taboos in our history. As such, it's unsurprising that many creation myths and stories about gods have stories on them indulging in this act. Some gods have a habit of eating other deities, for various reasons. Sometimes it's to gain the power of the consumed divinity, or it's a means of getting rid of the competition.\nOccasionally, the act of deicide will involve mortals eating gods, usually to gain their powers or as some kind of ritual. Often when a god eats another god, it's a sign that they're an Eldritch Abomination. Either way, Assimilation Backfire is a common result.\nCompare Monstrous Cannibalism (where monsters or other supernatural beings are not above eating each other) and Kill the God (usually has the same result as god eating, though without the cannibalism). Related to Divine Conflict, with one god eating each other being a possible end to the conflict. May occasionally lead to Too Spicy for Yog-Sothoth.\nHas nothing to do with God Eater.\n"}
{"SurpriseLitterOfPuppies": "Tropey's gone missing!!! Oh dear Lord, what am I gonna do? I mean, he's been acting so strangely. He's been wanting to get out of the house more, he won't eat, he won't sleep, he doesn't want me to pet him, I'm at a complete loss!\nWhat? Wait a minute... is that... Tropey with a girl dog? And gasp PUPPIES! And look, they're so cute!\nSee Your Tomcat Is Pregnant if they incorrectly thought the pet was a boy. Despite the trope name, this can apply to pets other than dogs\u2014in fact, it's just as common for it to involve kittens.\n"}
{"Sentai": "The Squad, Japanese style. The word can be translated as \"Task Force\" or \"Squadron.\" Usually come in teams, with color-keyed uniforms and a range of personalities/roles that usually follows some variation on the Five-Man Band. Known for their synchronized posing; also, a Standard Powerup Pose is often used in many Sentai works during the Transformation Sequence. A key concept is that the collective team are more important than the individual, and that more can be achieved by working together.\nAlthough there had been several superhero teams on Japanese television, the granddaddy of the whole \"color-coded superhero team\" concept is the live-action Super Sentai toku franchise which began in 1975, which is better known to western audiences as the source material for Power Rangers.\nA very western form of Sentai is to feature five teenagers receiving powers, with a transformation, i.e. it doesn't have to involve color-coding, or full body suits. They may not even transform at all, but have powers that combine to make a greater whole.\nContrary to popular belief, \"Sentai\" ONLY denotes to shows that have a squad of nigh-identical, color-coded superheroes, not every transforming superhero that comes from Japan (the proper term for that would be Henshin Hero, that belongs in the Tokusatsu genre).\nOlder Than Cable TV, the first usage of \"Sentai\" was for task forces in Imperial Japan, though variants existed as far back as feudal times. The JSDF currently doesn't use \"Sentai\", but does use the related term \"Kantai\".\nDo not confuse with Hentai, please. Even though there's definitely some unholy overlap somewhere.\n"}
{"CivilWarcraft": "In Real-Time Strategy games, the various factions are usually unified, monolithic entities. But fighting the same enemies in battle after battle gets boring. So the developers will often contrive some reason for fighting against your own side in single-player scenarios. Usually this involves betrayal or misunderstanding on one or both sides.\nAlso, the campaign mode in an RTS game often serves as an introduction to the multiplayer game. So the game is obligated to not only force you to play each side, but also to contrive reasons to encounter each possible matchup. Which includes fighting your own side.\nA storyline-motivated form of the Mirror Match. Compare Enemy Exchange Program and Enemy Civil War.\n"}
{"RemittanceMan": "\"That fop with the English Accent.\" An upper-crust younger son of an English lord with no prospect of inheriting, sent off to the Americas (or Australia, or South Africa, or anywhere on the map that happens to be painted pink during the time period) to get him out of the way. Usually given a small allowance (the \"remittance\"), that isn't quite sufficient to support him in the way he is accustomed but is enough to support him \u2014 if he'll just pare back his standards a bit. He also has an ingrained aversion to \"working in trade\", and he's not used to manual labor.\nIn Westerns, he's often connected somehow to the Cattle Baron; he may be the money-man or at least represent \"the money\", or be the \"manager\". Could also be a drunken wastrel with no visible means of support. In Canadian versions of the Old West he might be the local Mountie or the local criminal.\nIn Genteel Interbellum Setting mysteries, he's usually back from Australia or South Africa (occasionally South America, the US or Canada) and most of the family would prefer that he'd stayed gone.\nUsually only appears in fairly realistic Westerns, except in Canadian versions where he's a stock character. Permits the inclusion of a different version of the City Slicker type, more \"civilized\", more condescending, and generally just as incompetent.\nSometimes in other settings (like the South Pacific) where any European is likely an outcast, with many of the same tropes still applying.\nIf he's smart, he'll almost certainly overlap with the Gentleman Snarker.\n"}
{"InherentGift": "Magic that works. Maybe not exactly the way anyone wanted it to work, but it is not imaginary in the story and you may rely on it to do something. This style of phlebotinum is sometimes subject to magibabble, its own flavor of technobabble. Depending on the story, it may leave the Willing Suspension of Disbelief somewhat unstable.\nSome flavors of Functional Magic:\nIn many settings, whatever sort of magic is present, not everyone can work it, or some people can work it much better than others \u2014 so any of the other types can overlap with Inherent Gift magic. If such a gift only works, or works much better, if the gifted individual is properly trained, that's Training the Gift of Magic.\nWhile some magical systems allow it to do practically anything, restricted only by the user's power and imagination, in other systems the magic user is restricted to variations on a theme. Classic styles are:\nThese styles of magic crosscut the list of ways of doing magic above. While divining is often an inherent gift, there are also examples of pure diviners, unable to do any other style of magic, who see the future through theurgy, rule magic, device magic, or wild magic (or a combination). Whatevermancy is a common naming convention for fantasy magical styles. See Magic A Is Magic A. With all this wonderful diversity, you can expect some snobbish magicians to consider there are Unequal Rites. If practicing magic has a spiritual component, it may cross over with Enlightenment Superpowers. This Wiki has an article on writing Functional Magic systems.\nSee also Our Mages Are Different; this trope is Our Magic Is Different.\n"}
{"CaptureTheFlag": "Capture the Flag (CTF for short) is a game played by two or more sides, each of which is trying to capture the other's flag and return it to their base. The first side that accomplishes this a certain number of times, or scores the most captures within a designated period of time, wins. Variations include requiring that your flag be in your base before you can capture the enemy's, having a single flag that can only be captured by one team at a time, having multiple \"bases\" that must themselves be captured, and/or allowing players to be captured (or killed) as well as the flag.\nAs a game mode, this is found in nearly every First-Person Shooter with multiplayer capabilities, many Real-Time Strategy games, and even some MMORPGs. The objective being fought over isn't always a flag, but can be any object that can be picked up and moved by players. If the developers in an FPS or RTS game don't include a Capture the Flag mode, you can bet that the community will quickly whip one up via Game Mods. In fact, this is how CTF was first introduced to video games.\nThe flag generally has no capabilities of its own; it's not a weapon and brings no particular advantages to the team that holds it. In fact, many games will restrict the movement of the flag carrier, make him highly visible, make him unable to use a weapon while holding the flag, and/or increase the damage he takes, to encourage pursuit and discourage \"keep away\" tactics in which the carrier simply hides with the flag in order to deny victory to the enemy. In some games, the latter is even considered a form of Griefing.\nIf the \"flag\" moves on its own and one side is protecting it, that's an Escort Mission. When the flag brings instant victory to the team that captures it, it's a Golden Snitch.\n"}
{"SinglePowerSuperheroes": "There are many superheroes out there. Some, like Batman, do their super-heroing using years and years of training their bodies, showing human capability to a remarkable extent, possibly with the help from a utility belt as well. Others are like Superman, having a whole grab-bag of superpowers that needn't even be remotely related in some of the extreme cases. Then, there are superheroes like Cyclops. Beast Boy. Static. The middle-roaders. The ones that only have one listed superpower, but which they sometimes have many uses for.\nAs you can guess, this trope excuses unmentioned Required Secondary Powers, since they often aren't a power in their own right, though the line can get a little fuzzy at times. Elemental Powers are a sub-trope of this. In a show with Cast Speciation, this can easily become What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway?. (See Hawkman in the Superfriends cartoon.)\n"}
{"HumansAreAverage": "If you see any fantasy or science fiction setting involving humans and other sentient races, humans are highly likely to be average. Smart but not the smartest, strong but not the strongest, having ability to use magic but no affinity for it, have plenty of bastards among them but not necessarily Always Chaotic Evil. They live longer than mayflies but shorter than elves. In other words, humans are the literary Jack-of-All-Stats - as well as likely having average stats all around if this is an RPG-Mechanics Verse.\nConsidering Most Writers Are Human, you can expect to see that Humans Are Special in a specific way regardless. The closest thing to humanity's \"hat\" is diversity, adaptability and non-linear thinking. Humans might not be as good at magic as elves or as good at blacksmithing as dwarves, but they're still better than dwarves when it comes to magic and they may still be better blacksmiths than elves. They are frequently portrayed as more driven and adaptable than other races which are significantly more stagnant, which accounts for what they're able to accomplish in comparison to other races that have longer lifespans or greater skills in any given area, often eliciting some Fantastic Racism upon themselves in response. If left unchecked, humanity may leave everyone else in the dust as it progresses on the fast-track on Kardashev's scale; the end result is the End of an Age when humans inherit the world, but, sadly, The Magic Goes Away.\nA common justification is that \"Humans Are Baseline\" rather than \"Humans Are Average\". Since all readers can be expected to be reasonably familiar with the capabilities of a human, this can be used to define the abilities of other, non-human entities.\nCommon contrasts with humanity include spiritual Elves and phlegmatic Dwarves in Fantasy, mindless Bugs and soulless Robots in Sci-Fi, and purely good Angels and purely evil Demons in Mythology.\nCompare Rubber-Forehead Aliens (this tendency applied to alien looks), and contrast Humanity Is Superior (where humanity is... superior) and Puny Earthlings (where humanity is the worst).\n"}
{"VariationsOnAThemeSong": "A show's theme song is an important way that a show distinguishes itself and sets the tone for the series. It also gives a chance to feed the ego of the stars. But sometimes the regular theme song doesn't fit an abnormally serious episode, or the show is doing something special and wants to highlight it with a new arrangement.\nIn this case, the creators will replace the stock theme song. But the important thing that makes this different from Evolving Credits is that they then return to the original theme song. If the theme song changes for nearly every episode, then it's a Couch Gag. If the theme song is different from one season to the next, but is consistent within each season, it will fall under Anime Theme Song, Evolving Credits, or Rearrange the Song.\nCompare to Credits Gag, Theme Tune Cameo, Couch Gag, and (not to be confused with)Theme and Variations\nMay overlap with Variable Mix if the song changes mid-tune.\nMay also overlap with Leitmotif if the modification to the theme song has to do with the introduction, feature, or progression of a unique character associated with style of music used in the modification.\nMay overlap with Special Edition Title, which includes all modifications to normally consistent opening audio/visuals. (including studio logos, theme songs, etc.)\n"}
{"IThoughtYouWereDead": "Beloved major character is seemingly killed at the climax of the movie/episode, hearts are wrenched, four-year-olds are traumatized, grown men are reduced to tears, and then \u2014 oh look, the character is Not Quite Dead after all. \"I thought you were dead!\", they recite before walking off into the sunset.\nA variant is the Robot Disney Death where a Robot Buddy is seemingly destroyed in a Heroic Sacrifice. While at least one character mourns, the robot reappears fully repaired after an extensive period in Mr. Fixit's maintenance shop good as new and touched by all the concern.\nAnimated films seem destined to have these, considering the target audience is primarily young kids, and nobody wants to give a Downer Ending to them. Writers who are considering implementing it need to be extremely careful, as it can very easily come across as a tacky and cliched way to add some cheap drama to the ending. Over the years it has been done to \u2014 um \u2014 death, and audiences expect it. You run the risk of making your viewers remember they're watching television, even if it does shut up the Media Watchdogs.\nNamed after its frequent use in the Disney Animated Canon, though even Disney likes to kill 'em off for real now and then.\nSubtrope of Reports of My Death Were Greatly Exaggerated and First Law of Resurrection. Compare Sorting Algorithm of Deadness (how likely this is to happen), Our Hero Is Dead (when this is used as a Cliffhanger), Unexplained Recovery, World-Healing Wave (done on a massive scale), Only Mostly Dead, Plot Armor (you know he's going to live because he's the main character). Contrast Killed Off for Real. May involve Not Now, We're Too Busy Crying over You. A Premature Eulogy is likely to occur somewhere between the death and the return.\nNot to be confused with the related trope Disney Villain Death, which refers to a villain falling from a very high place, such as a cliff, although it can sometimes overlap with this trope when the antagonist doesn't actually die. Also not to be confused with Walt Disney's actual death.\nSince this trope requires both a death and an ending, be wary of large, unmarked spoilers.\n"}
{"TheFreakShow": "A Sideshow Act is a special show that involves people with strange or dangerous talents, and people with odd physical deformities or features.\nSome popular staples of sideshows include:\nSideshows can serve as interesting origin stories for characters. They can also be a hiding place for characters who have extraordinary powers, but were not accepted into society; after all, a traveling circus is just the place for an outcast to fit in without having to put down roots in a town.\nAt times, sideshow performers tend to be treated badly by the owners of the traveling circus or carnival. They often are paid little, abused, overworked, and dehumanized. They are gawked at by circus-goers, and treated as a spectacle. In real life, however, outright abusive management was much less common than in fiction - many wiser sideshow owners recognised that without their acts they had no income, and dealt with them more fairly. (A notable example of both is the real case of Joseph \"The Elephant Man\" Merrick: his London manager Tom Norman paid him well and treated him with respect, contrary to the Historical Villain Upgrade he gets in many dramatisations, but a subsequent manager stole his money and dumped him alone and penniless in the Netherlands.)\nCompare Circus of Fear; some \"sideshow freaks\" are not exactly the nicest guys, and may be very dangerous. (Having people taunting and staring at you all day long because of some aspect of your appearance or an unusual talent you have is stressful.) Watch your step. Not to be confused with Carnival of Killers, however, which is different.\nAlso compare Come to Gawk, which comes up frequently in works about Freakshows, as well as the Point-and-Laugh Show, which is the TV version of this trope.\n"}
{"Synchronisation": "Two people are linked together, or a person is linked to an object, such that whatever happens to one also happens to the other. Killing or harming one of them will lead to the death or equivalent harm of both. You wouldn't think this would be desirable, but it works the other way too; see Empathic Weapon.\nIf enemies are linked together, and are therefore forced to protect or aid each other to ensure their own safety, this becomes a form of Chained Heat.\nIdentical twins on TV often experience this, as with The Corsican Brothers of literature. It's also common with the Enemy Without.\nFrequently goes hand-in-hand with a Psychic Link, because Your Mind Makes It Real, and sometimes with Mindlink Mates or Twin Telepathy. Compare My Significance Sense Is Tingling. Can be exploited for very interesting effect. See also Shared Life Meter, a related video game trope. Reality Changing Miniature is a variant of this, where an object or person is linked this way with its representation.\nIf the link can ensure the death of a participant but doesn't otherwise transmit pain or other feelings, then it isn't a Synchronization but a case of Can't Live Without You. Compare Psychic Glimpse of Death, where one party experiences the death of another while connected to their mind but is able to survive.\n"}
{"TheRant": "The Rant, a.k.a. News Post, is a section of text below a webcomic strip that acts as a blog for the authors \u2014 sometimes, using actual blog software. They comment on their lives, beg for forgiveness for plot holes and irregular updates, and generally fill in the blanks.\nThis section is called \"the rant\" because it can be (and has been) used as a soap box to orate from. It's usually used more constructively than that. The rant helps improve the cross-media feel of webcomics, often acting as an easy-to-access Universe Compendium, built up slowly beneath each strip. It also allows the comic's creators to present themselves personally to the readers and shill The Merch.\nAlmost all webcomickers have a rant of some kind, whether it's called a newspost, blog, or something else. If more than one person works on the comic, such as a writer and an artist, they will each have their own rant section. Occasionally, other people, such as the person who hosts the website, the person who runs the forum, or random friends of the creators will chime in as well.\nIn some comics, it's taken as given that you'll read the rant, with the strip itself being an utterly incomprehensible non sequitur otherwise. Almost all strips of such a comic will have some explanation or extra detail in the rant, making it important as a frame for the strip. Others rarely update their rant, and only post philosophical musings and important announcements at irregular intervals.\nNot to be confused with the similar but usually more overt Author Tract, nor \"The Reason You Suck\" Speech.\n"}
{"PopCulturePunEpisodeTitle": "A subtype of Pun-Based Title which applies to individual episode titles, and not the fact that the pun is based upon some element of popular culture, such as the title of a film, book or song. Catch Phrases, song lyrics, adages and colloquialisms can also be riffed on.\nAlso a subtrope of Idiosyncratic Episode Naming. Related to Literary Allusion Title and can sometimes overlap.\nOften a sign of a Whole Plot Reference; indeed, many of the subtropes listed on that page (like Charlie and the Chocolate Parody) are examples themselves.\n"}
{"StrawAffiliation": "Bob belongs to a lot of groups. For example, he might be a man, an atheist, a heterosexual, and he might also have black skin.\nNow, Alice picks one of these many groups, and simply assumes that because of that Bob has certain opinions, beliefs, even needs. If Bob doesn't agree, it's because Bob doesn't know what's good for him, or maybe doesn't even know what he really wants. She might even go so far as accusing him of being a Category Traitor. Or simply dismiss him as not being a ''real'' man/atheist/heterosexual/black/whatever.\nThe specific attitude toward this type of person can vary depending on the real or supposed affiliation of their accuser. While someone of their same (superficial) group will probably play the \"traitor\" card, someone in a different group (or who has voluntarily joined a different group not because they wanted to, but because they felt they had to, which is itself an example of this trope) might well respond with resentment rather than disgust. A white moderate or (guilty-conscience) liberal, for example, might feel anger toward a conservative of color because of their supposed unfair advantage: \"If I said the things you said, you people would call me a redneck!\"\nWhen a character does this kind of stereotyping, it is Straw Affiliation. When it's the author who does this, it's something else... typically a Strawman Political, maybe in an Author Tract.\nSee also Gay Conservative, Blonde Republican Sex Kitten, No True Scotsman, Cultural Rebel, Uncle Tom Foolery. Contrast Mars-and-Venus Gender Contrast, where gender-based Straw Affiliation is justified by the narrative.\n"}
{"TheGoodQueen": "When it comes to women in positions of power with royal lineage, there are two flavors. On one hand, you have the evil, power-hungry bitches. And on the other hand, you have this trope.\nA woman of wealth, power, and near-impossible beauty. She always has a calm demeanor and regal bearing. Her very voice, even if it doesn't ring with power (and it often does), still lets you know that, in some way, she's probably better than you, even if the lady herself doesn't look down on you at all.\nHer beauty can often be so great, even simple robes look majestic on her.\nHer beauty and goodness are usually to be admired passionately but from some distance. The High Queen is rarely a love interest, but the few times she is, expect a little warming up due to the charms of the hero.\nA common characterization for non-evil regnant queens, princesses (the more mature ones) and goddesses (especially the non-evil/bastardy ones). May also be the polar opposite of the Rich Bitch. This is what The Ojou and Princess Classic want to be when they grow up. If she can fight, she's a Lady of War. Sometimes we get to see glimpses \u2014 or the whole story from the POV \u2014 of The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask. She's also very likely to have a Lady and Knight relationship with one of her subjects at some point. For the others, she typically commands such high respect and devotion that her subjects will march to and fight at the Gates of Hell without question if she needed them to.\nLike other \u00dcber-character types, The High Queen runs a risk of becoming a Mary Sue, though mostly an acceptable one at that.\nThe presence of a High Queen is sometimes an indication of a Matriarchy.\nThe Iron Lady is the non-royal version of this trope; because non-royals are not born with their position, they have to fight for them and such characters generally combine elements of The High Queen and God Save Us from the Queen!. If she literally fights, she, too, is a Lady of War. If her fighting is more indirect and subtle, she is Silk Hiding Steel.\nDespite the name, this unrelated to The High King. In terms of the ranks of Authority Tropes, the tropes that are equal are God Save Us from the Queen! (her Evil Counterpart), The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask, She Is the King, Iron Lady, The Good King(her Spear Counterpart) and President Evil. The next steps down are Princely Tropes (Prince Charming being its ground zero) and Princess Tropes (ditto Princess Classic). The next step up is The Emperor.\n"}
{"AlphaCouple": "This is when the main characters in any given story are undeniably a couple. (Thus, in heroic stories The Hero and The Chick are the usual couple, though it isn't always them.) The important thing to know about this trope is that the characters are overtly paired off, so even if they never kiss on screen or even flirt with other characters, it's understood by the cast (and hopefully the audience) that the two are an item. Naturally, this does absolutely nothing to offset Shipping.\nSometimes, there's another couple that sometimes serves as a Foil and/or companion to the \"official\" couple that involves The Hero. This other couple usually involves The Lancer and a minor female. This couple is called the Beta Couple.\nExpect: She Is Not My Girlfriend, Just Friends, Everyone Can See It, Like Brother and Sister, and Lampshade Hanging.\nIf this trope breaks up a Fan-Preferred Couple, expect Ship-to-Ship Combat to ensue.\nSide-Story Bonus Art often has the couple getting married. Speaking of which, if this the path that the couple ends up taking, it is very likely to fall under being Happily Married.\nSee also Love Chart. Contrast One True Pairing, Fan-Preferred Couple. If the plot tortures the official couple, then that's Official Couple Ordeal Syndrome.\nA REMINDER: A couple is an official couple only if they acknowledge their feelings and enter into a relationship in Canon. Ship Teasing and Unresolved Sexual Tension do not count, nor does your favorite Fan Fic or Doujinshi. Do not use this page as a proxy for Ship-to-Ship Combat.\n"}
{"MassiveRaceSelection": "This is the game subtrope of Loads and Loads of Races, involving races you can play as. Sometimes, a Tabletop Game or Video Game setting just has a metric boatload of playable races \u2014 even more than the standard Five Races. Once the number of options reaches six or more, you end up with this trope.\nNote that \"race\" here means intelligent species or subspecies \u2014 not skin colors, cultures, or factions, and certainly not racing games. Sometimes a \"race\" is less a biological distinct species, and more of a mutation or modification (such as werewolves, zombies, cyborgs, vampires), but the important part here is whether they're mechanically distinct or not. If they have separate stats, separate starting zones and quests, or otherwise work differently then they count; if the difference is purely cosmetic then they don't.\nThe trope happens in three ways:\nIn this trope, a playable race is one that exists as a separate option for the player. In Strategy Games where you pick a faction instead of making one character, the playable races are the main species of each faction \u2014 if a faction has some odd members of some other species, those don't constitute a separate playable race.\nThis is a medium-specific subtrope of Loads and Loads of Races.\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nIn Fiction\n"}
{"SlowLoadingInternetImage": "When someone is browsing the Internet for a date, or finally gets the picture of that sweet person they've been talking to in the chatbox. When the picture loads, it loads from the bottom up (instead of normal from the top down loading). You see beautiful long legs, nice clothes, long hair etc. The person looking at it will comment in excitement until they see the face and realize their dreamgirl turns out to be a lot less desirable. They are either ugly, a relative or someone they really hate.\nReal slow loading internet images tend to load from the top, although uncompressed Windows bitmap (.bmp) files will start loading from the bottom. Being uncompressed, they can be hundreds of times larger than an equivalent compressed image, and for some reason, are stored bottom-up (at least traditionally). However, BMP files are almost never used on the Internet (and in fact, forbidden on standards-compliant web pages).\nCan also apply to various other things. But the key is the Slow Loading Internet Image promising something sweet but getting a twist when done loading. The loading can also occur horizontal, basically any way the show wants it to make the scene funny/exciting.\nSomething of a Discredited Trope in light of just how much Technology Marches On; most internet connections these days are more than capable of handling adequately-sized images. A more modern equivalent is slow or choppy video buffering, which is still very much an issue for most.\n"}
{"RespawningEnemies": "Hooray, you have managed to defeat the enemies that attacked you in this room. Don't get too cocky! Because when you return to this room later on, the enemies are fine and well again.\nMay even happen in games where levels aren't based on rooms, but set in one big area; in this case, the enemies respawn in a set position after a set period of time. Or possibly as soon as you move out of sight/attack range.\nRespawning enemies come in several varieties:\nBosses are exempt from this. Bonus and other items usually don't respawn this way, unless something Randomly Drops, then you're expected to come back and fight the same enemy over and over until the Random Number God smiles in your favor.\nThis could be pleasurable for people who like to endlessly slaughter things, mildly to extremely tedious for most people, and absolutely horrible for people who feel guilty about killing them (which prompts the question: why are you playing a game that requires you to do exactly that?).\nWith very few exceptions, this applies to every online combat game ever created. (One of those exceptions: some early MUDs removed slain enemies from the game semi-permanently; they would only return when the game was reset.)\nCompare Puzzle Reset, which applies to more than just enemies. Contrast Reviving Enemy, in which an enemy gets back up rather than replaced. See also Mook Maker.\n"}
{"StrategyVersusTactics": "To get what you want from a war, you need to know exactly what you want and how to get it, including whether a war is a good/the best way to get what you want in the first place! But many people aren't well-informed about how it all works out.\nOr, according to 19th/20th century Anglo-American understandings of warfare:\nEnglish-language scholarship was slow to accept the existence of the other levels of warfare, only recognizing them fifty years after both were conceived of in their totality (the 1920s). This was largely because the small scale and scope of Anglo-American military operations in wartime and their highly unusual glut of logistical resources allowed British Commonwealth and US forces to improvise ad hoc campaigns which were generally passable despite the lack of intellectual and planning framework for them. Military studies of \"Strategy\" were largely or even entirely subsumed into the realm of \"Politics\" and therefore only had vague and limited military connotations, leaving military theory to a heavy focus upon Tactics.\nInterestingly, \"Operations/Campaigns\" actually failed to jump the German-English and Russian-English language barriers until the concept itself was recognized. German theorists under von Schlieffen developed the first, tentative beginnings of the Operation (\"Operativ\") in the early 1900s and the concept of \"Operational Art\" was only fully realised by Soviet theorists including Isserson & Triandfillov in the late 1920s. Ignoring the actual concepts being proposed in those texts, all contemporary and subsequent US translations of these texts translated the term \"Operation\" as \"Strategy\". Curiously, and to their credit, the British actually managed to develop a flawed but semi-coherent concept of Operations as 'Minor Strategy' from their World War I experiences... until US theory came to dominate the NATO military theory in the 1950s.\nFocusing only on the short-term often ends up screwing you over in the long-term. In storytelling this is sometimes ignored or glossed over; the immediate result is all that matters. Then there are the stories about how tough it can be to stick to the strategy when it might be simpler and more gratifying to do the thing that looks more honorable or piles up more meaningless victories. As long as there is a polarity of this sort, the story will be able to mine some good conflict.\nThe trope often takes the form of An Aesop along the lines of \"he won the battle but lost the war\" (or the other way around). Related to Won the War, Lost the Peace (which is a strategic victory, but a grand-strategic defeat). Also, compare Hollywood Tactics which shows unrealistic battle plans that, logically, should fail but don't. Strategy itself is often dealt with by The Strategist who may or may not also be proficient in tactical thinking. See also We Win... Because You Didn't.\n"}
{"LabCoatOfScienceAndMedicine": "In media, there are two sorts of people who wear labcoats: scientists and medical doctors. As such, a character wearing a lab coat is a good indication that they're involved in either science (and/or Mad Science!), or a medical field. This is despite the fact that in real life doctors and scientists do not normally wear such coats unless there is a reason that they need to keep their clothes clean, and should definitely not wear them in public because they might expose people to dangerous substances. In media, this coat is almost always white.\nA subtrope of the Labcoat of Science and Medicine is the Mad Scientist Lab Coat which is typically the Howie-style lab coat with the asymmetrical front panel and the high, stiff collar. This style of full-coverage lab coat, designed to minimize pathogen contact with street clothing, has long been associated with esoterically-minded scientists from Dr. Frankenstein to Dr. Horrible, and is pretty much a clear sign that its wearer doesn't care about such silly things as medical ethics boards while he Gets Shit Done. Another marker of Science-Related Memetic Disorder is when the coat (Howie-style, or otherwise) is particularly ragged, tattered, stained with unknown substances and full of holes burned by acid, lightning or god knows what else; this is a clear sign that the wearer experiments with dangerous stuff, doesn't care about either safety or appearance. note\u00a0In Real Life, scientists tend to replace damaged coats with new ones as soon as possible. However, if the coat is only stained with a non-dangerous substance, it can remain for quite some time.\nSupertrope to Dressed to Heal which also requires a stethoscope and a head mirror. Compare Einstein Hair, another classic visual cue that screams \"Science person!\"\n"}
{"MusicBoxIntervals": "A song (the genre of the song can be rock and roll, heavy metal, pop, country, alternative rock, etc.) has intervals of music that sound like they came from a music box. These music box intervals may sound light-hearted, nostalgic, or calming compared to the rest of the song. Sometimes it can serve as a creepy contrast to the actual song, or it may actually go well with the general theme/sound of the song.\nCompare Ominous Music Box Tune.\n"}
{"ArtifactCollectionAgency": "An Artifact Collection Agency is a group of people who make it their business to collect mysterious artifacts. Sometimes this is done to protect the artifacts from misuse, or to protect the world from the artifacts which are considered inherently dangerous. Of course, collectors can have ulterior motives, too.\nThough they are more often run by the government, sometimes private citizens form Artifact Collection Agencies and create fabulous repositories for them in the form of the Bazaar of the Bizarre, Trophy Room or Superhero Trophy Shelf. Governmental artifact collectors will often have a Secret Government Warehouse where recovered artifacts are kept under lock and key.\nOf course, they Gotta Catch Them All.\n"}
{"PrimaryColorChampion": "We know that Red Is Heroic. And sometimes even Blue Is Heroic. There's almost no better way to say your character is a hero than giving them a costume that is primarily red, blue and sometimes yellow for good measure.\nIf you see a character wearing both red and blue prominently, chances are they are The Hero, the main character, or at least playing for the good guys' side. With blue typically symbolizing heroic resolve and caring, while the red stands for righteous passion and strength, it is a good visual shorthand to the audience that this is a person you can trust.\nRed and blue are both strong colors that balance well and are commonly paired together. Usually blue below the belt and red above whether wearing armor, dresses, superhero tights, or as simple as blue jeans and a red t-shirt. Yellow is the go to for a third color (with white being a fourth option). The other typical set up is that most of costume will be blue, an iconic piece of it (such as a hat or a cape) will be red, and yellow will be used for accents, trims, buttons, logos, and other accessories.\nSometimes a heroic institution may make a point of giving its members red, blue and yellow uniforms. If it's just a small group, however, you may be looking for Chromatic Arrangement or Color-Coded Characters.\nThis trope may have stemmed from the early days of comicbooks in which heroic characters typically had color schemes that sported Primary Colors (Red, blue, yellow, like Superman) while villains typically had secondary colors (Purple, green, orange, gray - think The Joker, Green Goblin or Lex Luthor's iconic Powered Armor).\nA Sub-Trope of Good Colors, Evil Colors, Red Is Heroic and Blue Is Heroic.\nContrast Red and Black and Evil All Over. The inverse is a Secondary Color Nemesis.\n"}
{"OnlyWorksOnce": "...and if it fails, too bad. You only get the one shot.\nIt Only Works Once is a method of defeating the bad guy which is completely useless in the following episodes. It could be something where you literally have only one shot, like a Forgotten Superweapon or other Applied Phlebotinum that cannot be replaced once it's used up. It might be a tactic that relies on the element of surprise, like an attempt to exploit an Achilles' Heel vulnerability that the enemy will correct or at least guard more carefully once it's brought to his attention.\nReversed, it is a common trope of cartoon series. The Big Bad will come up with some undefeatable plan that almost works save for some streak of luck on the part of the heroes (see the Road Runner shorts for some especially lucky breaks), but will never think of trying it again after being foiled the first time.\nOccasionally a special attack that Only Works Once will end up being used in The Worf Barrage.\nWhen you're getting near the end of a show or film and you know the trope will be averted because it's near the end and not a tragedy work, you're being Spoiled by the Format.\nNever Recycle Your Schemes is a subtrope. Compare So Last Season, Forgotten Phlebotinum, Holding Back the Phlebotinum, No Plans, No Prototype, No Backup. See also Adaptive Ability, Reed Richards Is Useless, and the Disposable Superhero Maker. Most Wave Motion Guns apply a limited form of this trope by making its use prohibitively slow and energy-intensive, but the usual dramatic application is rather different. Often overlaps with Death-or-Glory Attack.\n"}
{"Phobia": "A seemingly invulnerable character reveals that they are deathly afraid of X... therefore, X is certainly going to be a recurring obstacle, no matter how unlikely. The Trope Namer is a line in Raiders of the Lost Ark, reminding us that Indiana Jones hates snakes (ophidiophobia) when he discovers that the Well of Souls is crawling with them.\nA subset of Fatal Flaw. Fear of Thunder (also known as brontophobia), Spiders Are Scary (arachnophobia), Claustrophobia, Afraid of Blood (hemophobia), Afraid of Doctors (iatrophobia), and Afraid of Needles (trypanophobia) are specific sub-tropes of this.\nThis is common in horror/sci-fi stories dealing with a \"master of fear\" (such as boggarts, Freddy, Pennywise, or the Scarecrow), in which the monster uses his powers to guess his victim's worst fear, and then use it against him/her to make them a quivering heap. Enemies who know about this weakness are prone to use Flaw Exploitation and as a way of coercing the hero. It can also overlap with The Dreaded. If an innocuous object causes fear that renders someone helpless, it may overlap with Weaksauce Weakness. Also compare Absurd Phobia, where an unusual (and usually non-plot relevant) fear is Played for Laughs.\nAs you can imagine, Truth in Television. Compare Primal Fear for examples where common phobias are gleefully exploited in horror fiction. No personal examples, please. Not to be confused with Reptiles Are Abhorrent, but it helps to explain it some.\n"}
{"StonePunk": "Stonepunk is a sub-genre of the Punk Punk science fiction genre. Stonepunk focuses on pre-technological developments in pre-historic times, its juxtapositions of the modern world with the primitive, and the effects of an early form of 'advanced' technology on society, like The Flintstones, based on primitive materials such as rock, fire, clay, rope, wood and water. Unlike most classic Cyber Punk or Steam Punk influenced fiction like Clock Punk, the Stone Age supplies the inspiration behind a modified form of technology based on the materials provided by the natural elements and surrounding environment. Bamboo Technology is common. Depending on the setting, there may be Sufficiently Advanced Bamboo Technology as well.\nThe defining feature of Stone Punk is the representation of modern inventions and technology but made with primitive materials. The idea here is that road signs and furnishings would not have existed, but as a Rule of Funny and in order to further highlight the primary societal differences they have been included. Having the familiar aspects can make the foreign aspects seem even more foreign to the audience, which is used as a method of storytelling as a sort of constant reminder that \"this work is set in a completely different world\".\n"}
{"PowerCrutch": "A Power Crutch is some object which enables a character to use his or her superpowers, or at least assists in their use. It differs from a Magic Feather in that the Magic Feather is a placebo, while the Power Crutch is not. A Power Crutch has some in-story justification for why it works.\nWithout the Power Crutch, the character will find it difficult, if not impossible to use his or her powers. Characters who use Power Crutches may eventually learn to use their abilities without them. The power user, or sometimes others, may even mistake the Power Crutch for the source of his powers\u2014 though it isn't. Often, especially in sequential works like comics, a Power Crutch will be revealed (or retconned) to have been a Magic Feather all along.\nMay be an Amplifier Artifact raising the power level from \"sometimes noticeable\" to useful. Compare Transformation Trinket, a different sort of superpower enabler.\nContrast its inversion, Power Limiter. They are not mutually exclusive, however; some characters may have uncontrollable powers that they need some device that limits their power AND allows them to control it reliably.\n"}
{"CerebusRollerCoaster": "There are many reasons why the tone of a story may change. Sometimes a happy, joke-based show goes into a much more serious and darker direction. Sometimes a once dark and deadly serious series turns into a comedy. Sometimes the work completely changes its genre. Sometimes writers run out of ideas and just try to put out anything they can or the exact opposite \u2014 they find what they really want to do. Sometimes Executive Meddling or Creator Breakdown takes the story in a new direction and turns it into something completely unrecognizable from its source material.\nAnd sometimes all of it happens at the same time.\nCerebus Rollercoaster is what happens when Cerebus Syndrome gets zig-zagged \u2014 the series goes back and forth through different tones, jumps from genre to genre or dances on the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism. If this ends well, the series can end up Growing the Beard by absorbing the best elements of all the phases it went through. If not, it may end up Jumping the Shark.\nThis may occur for different reasons. Sometimes creators just plain don't know exactly what tone they want to give their work. Maybe the story went too far into Cerebus Syndrome, and the writer is tired and horrified of the Crapsack World it has become, but while trying to reverse the process, he finds out that new, Darker and Edgier settings have a lot of fans, so he desperately tries to balance drama and comedy to keep both fanbases happy. Sometimes the new writer decides to take the series in a new direction, then into another direction and so on, until fans who have grown to be writers themselves take the series back to its original roots. Some people may just Follow the Leader too much, and when the leader changes, so too does the direction of their story. And sometimes they just don't want to stick to one setting and are forced to discard all story ideas which are too dark or too light for basic settings. Tropes Are Tools \u2014 when played right, it may give a series a unique, recognizable style and keep it fresh. If done badly, however, this will pretty much turn the story into a train wreck.\nCompare Mood Whiplash, which is a smaller version of this taking place within a single story rather than spaced out among multiple installments. Dude, Not Funny! may occur if one character is lagging between transitions.\n"}
{"EvilLaughter": "Your Applied Phlebotinum doomsday device has been activated. The MacGuffin is within your grasp. The good guys are locked away in the Death Trap. Your circuitous Evil Plan is three-quarters complete! You know what, screw being the Evil Overlord of the world \u2014 you're already a god! There is only one thing left for you to do \u2014 but first things first:\nMuahahahahaha... Muahahahahahaha... Muahahahahahaha!\nThe Evil Laugh. Don't knock it 'til you tried it, folks.\nThis became an Undead Horse Trope long ago and usually will produce nothing but pure Narm. There are only a few characters who are able to get away with this in modern media:\nIn any case, it has since devolved to the occasional evil chuckle (which may or may not be a bit scarier) or so every once in a while, except in certain cases, and the trope of laughing while your victim is helpless is definitely dead, as modern villains usually laugh while they work (to much better effect). A common subversion is to have a villain have an Un-Evil Laugh, with snorting, chuckling, and squeaking, especially if they are a villain in a comedy series.\nJust remember, you Genre Savvy villains, the Evil Overlord List:\nTruth in Television: Passionate laughter, like screaming, is a great relief for stress and adrenaline, with the added benefit of embarrassing and taunting self-conscious opponents. Just don't take it too far in public.\nCompare Noblewoman's Laugh, Evil Is Hammy, Evil Gloating, Evil Has a Bad Sense of Humor, Drunk on the Dark Side, Laughing Mad, and Laugh with Me!. When it looks like the villain is defeated, but then they pull this out, it's Ominous Adversarial Amusement. It's even more jarring (and awesome) when the villain in question is an emotionless character.\nSee here for a huge compilation of this trope.\n"}
{"CantTakeCriticism": "It's hard to listen to criticism, whether it's being put down in a blunt manner because we aren't doing certain things correctly or it's being criticized for our decision making, especially if it's moral. Instead of taking heed to it, some would break down miserably and are unable or unwilling to make themselves better. Then there are some would go as far as to become unexpectedly enraged by it. This character hates being criticized in every way possible. At best, they often mistake the criticism for an insult more than Constructive Criticism, or maybe the criticism was too unpleasant and harsh for them to handle. At worst, the character just naturally hates criticism period and would rather listen to something they want to hear. Even gentle criticism will cause the character to dish out Disproportionate Retribution. Not even a Compassionate Critic or an Honest Advisor can deal with this character.\nIn moral situations, a character who resents being rebuked for taking a dark turn (usually a hero bordering to Anti-Hero territory) can make him worse than ever. If the character is a villain, showing displeasure in criticism for his wickedness can demonstrate how they cannot comprehend good. This can be seen as a character getting revenge on those who had a justifiable reason to criticize them, which makes them petty.\nThis encompasses narcissistic characters like the Insufferable Genius, Entitled Bastard, and The Prima Donna. It is also the hallmark of a Small Name, Big Ego character. Can easily make the character prone to Wangst.\nCompare Minor Insult Meltdown if it's one single criticism that shakes up a character. A Fragile Flower can easily be prone to this, though they would break down in tears instead of reacting angrily. Often overlaps into With Due Respect. The trademark method of ensuring a Bad Boss will be set on destroying you is to commit this trope. Can be a response to a complainer who actually is right for once. If someone's constructive criticism ends up being a Fisticuff-Provoking Comment, it's a sure sign that person's attempt has failed. Contrast Heroic Self-Deprecation. A Straw Critic character might stem from this flaw on part of the author. This is unfortunately Truth in Television (and got many messengers shot).\n"}
{"SparkFairy": "Often in fiction, fairy creatures, fireflies or other magical insects get depicted as simple little points of light rather than going for a full design for something so tiny we'll never get a good look at it.\nThe obvious inspiration is fireflies. It's funny how fireflies often end up behaving in unusual and rather magical ways. In a way, it's an example of the connection between light and magic.\nDo not confuse with By the Lights of Their Eyes; this trope is about Energy Beings or Faceless Masses that may or may not sparkle. See also Will-o'-the-Wisp (point of light that leads unwary travelers into danger) and Hitodama Light (floating flame that represent ghosts).\n"}
{"TheChurch": "Organized religion serves as a major source of authority figures. Fiction can build on this by attributing to The Church an absurd amount of power, official or not, and organization, or go the other direction and portray its members as harmless old men sipping tea.\nSubtropes include Saintly Church, Corrupt Church, Scam Religion, Path of Inspiration, and Religion of Evil.\n"}
{"SomeDayThisWillComeInHandy": "Some characters are vast stores of useless knowledge. Now, normally, you'd think that useless knowledge would never come in handy, right?\nYou'd be wrong.\nBecause, by Law of Conservation of Detail, or maybe because of some usage of the Idiot Ball, there will rise an exact situation where their trivial knowledge will come to the rescue. Sometimes it requires a Plot Tailored to the Party to happen, other times it just happens naturally. In any case, their so-called \"useless knowledge\" will save the day. Of course, this is pretty much the mantra of the Crazy-Prepared.\nThis is the subtrope of Chekhov's Gun when the object is something a character knows, though occasionally it is a Deus ex Machina. May lead to This Is No Time for Knitting. Compare This Looks Like a Job for Aquaman, where it's a useless superpower that comes in handy. When it's a seemingly useless item or knick-knack, It May Help You on Your Quest.\nChekhov's Hobby and Chekhov's Classroom leads to this. Compare Figure It Out Yourself, You Will Know What to Do.\n"}
{"StoryBookOpening": "A common device for starting a story, especially fairy tales, is to begin with a book opening. The Opening Narration goes on as normal, but as it goes on the book opens and we fade to see the story itself being played out. Just as if it came from the book itself. Usually the story will finish with the book being closed.\nThe Trope Maker here is the Disney Animated Canon, which has used it since the very beginning with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\nA subtrope of Framing Device. A sister trope of the one where the book is shown as it is being written.\n"}
{"SleuthDatesCop": "Romance between Police Forces and unofficial investigators (Amateur Sleuth, Private Detective, Magician Detective, etc) can be complicated. Expect the couple to go back-and-forth between helping each other with their work and getting in each other's way. Sometimes they'll have a Friend on the Force situation going on, where the cop provides the sleuth with information about a case, maybe even with access to the crime scene, and the sleuth, after discovering a culprit, will let the cop make the arrest. Other times, one or both may be sabotaging their partner's investigation, usually to keep them safe from finding the truth.\nThe relationship between these law enforcers and unofficial investigators is strained by many factors. They're often working towards the same goals and have a lot in common, but the police officer has rules and regulations to follow, which the independent sleuth often ignores and gets in the way of. The cop also has a duty to protect citizens from harm, a job not made any easier by their sleuth friend throwing themselves into dangerous situations. The cop may worry that their significant other will get hurt or killed one of these days, and try to dissuade their partner from sleuthing. It's not uncommon for the cop to come to the rescue when the sleuth gets in over their heads, resulting in a Rescue Romance. In some cases, the cop isn't even aware the person they're dating is an independent sleuth, forcing the sleuth to act like they're just really interested in their partner's work so they can get information to fuel their own investigation. Expect this secret to put a big strain on the relationship, with a dramatic confrontation when the cop inevitably finds out.\nWhile this sort of relationship can theoretically exist in a Cop Show, most often the sleuth is the lead character and the cop is their Love Interest. As such, we're usually not meant to agree with the cop's objections to the sleuth's involvement in the case, and if the relationship goes on long enough, the cop will eventually come around.\n"}
{"EvilPrincess": "She's the daughter/niece/granddaughter/etc of an Evil Overlord, who shares her parent's ambition, cunning, and cruelty. She could be anything from a simple Spoiled Brat to an Overlord in waiting. She's also likely to be a Princess (since even villainy is improved with that), although she will still prefer wearing black or dark colors over pink.\nViewers should neither expect her to be The Ingenue nor expect a Heel\u2013Face Turn from her, even if she falls for the hero. That would more be her just wanting him for herself than willingly joining his side; she'll want him to willingly join her side (and his refusal is likely to inspire Woman Scorned, however little reason she had to believe that he might accept).\nShe is more likely to be a Dark Action Girl than a Dark Magical Girl, because the latter has a high chance of becoming good after her Magical Girl counterpart defeats her in combat or otherwise convinces her to switch sides with The Power of Friendship. On the other hand, she is prone to Revenge by Proxy subjected by an Anti-Hero in a darker setting.\nShe might team up with the heroes, but only for the same reason any other dragon would team up with them. Then it's enemies again.\nIf she's above a certain age, she is going to be hot, often a cooler character than the female lead, and might wear less. If the bad guys are the Yellow Peril or otherwise \"Asian-themed\", expect her to be a Dragon Lady.\nIf her father is defeated, she will be the one doing the avenging. On the other hand, she might get impatient waiting for Mommy and Daddy to die so she can take their place. In this case, she might decide to become a Self-Made Orphan and The Usurper all at once. In the meantime, mom or dad might give her a first rate education by sending her to the Academy of Evil. If it turns out her Evil Parents Want Good Kids, expect a disappointment. To correct this acquired morality they may send her to a Superhero School.\nA (literal) Sister Trope to Overlord Jr. (the Spear Counterpart to this).\nCompare Mad Scientist's Beautiful Daughter (who may or may not be evil), The Evil Prince, Protected by a Child, Dark Mistress, and Even Bad Men Love Their Mamas.\nContrast Princess Classic, Defecting for Love, Evil Parents Want Good Kids, and Mafia Princess (unless, of course, she's being groomed to take over the family business).\n"}
{"FinalBossNewDimension": "You're off to fight the Final Boss, so you end up having to go to another dimension. A Video Game trope, probably caused because the developers want it to be memorable, impressive, and/or awesome. May very well have an Amazing Technicolor Battlefield or be a High-Altitude Battle. It might also come with a Surreal Theme Tune. The main thing, however, is that it's in its own dimension, universe, or whatever. Fighting the boss in a different time period also counts. May also be applied to Bonus Bosses, even though they're not the final boss. A common part of Trippy Finale Syndrome, it is usually to be found in The Very Definitely Final Dungeon. Depending on the characteristics of the new dimension, it may or may not invoke Interesting Situation Duel. Sister trope to Amazing Technicolor Battlefield.\nA particularly common variant involves going To Hell and Back, usually to defeat a baddie planning to unleash Hell on Earth.\n"}
{"TwoShorts": "A once popular format in which to present a cartoon show. The half hour, 22 minutes of program time, is used to show three six-minute short cartoons. The remaining time is used for short framing segments or one-minute gags.\nMany shows follow an A-B-A form for this format, meaning one series has a short in the first slot and in the last. This \"A\" series is generally the one that gives the whole show its name. The middle slot is filled by a second \"B\" series, that may or may not get billing in the Title Sequence. The \"B\" series is often in the same universe as the \"A\" series, and the two can often Crossover, with the virtue that everyone who has seen the one will almost inevitably see the other. Hanna-Barbera liked this format for its Cartoon Network original shows, and many of its older productions.\nThis form has some advantages. The short episodes are easier to produce in parallel, since writing and animation tasks can be farmed out to a bigger staff, resulting in higher productivity. This, and carrying a comedic story for 22 minutes can be tricky. A six-minute short doesn't give the premise of a joke enough time to run out of steam.\nThis is different from an Animated Anthology, in that a specific two or three series are used, and both are made new for this format. Animated Anthologies have widely variable structures within a given episode, while Three Shorts shows are usually locked into the exact form.\nThe Three Shorts format became eclipsed by the Two Shorts format around the turn of the century, this being a pair of eleven-minute episodes. Originally very rare, it's now the standard for comedy animation, as it allows for more complex stories to be told while still not having the aforementioned hurdles that come with writing a half-hour story. In addition, some half-hour animated shows will have a few Two Shorts episodes, any half of which can be used as emergency schedule filler around odd-length specials or movies.\nSometimes, in between the shorts are super-short one-joke bits. Garfield and Friends called these \"Quickies\", and they were often adapted from a single Sunday strip.\nCompare Quarter Hour Short, where an eleven-minute short isn't paired with a companion short. Cartoon Network is especially fond of airing new episodes of their shows in this format, later showcasing them in their Two Shorts form during re-runs.\nThe granddaddy of this trope, Western Animation, has so many examples that it got its own page.\n"}
{"RagtagBunchofMisfits": "This mission is important. The fate of the battle, nay, the war, nay, the entire world rests on the outcome. Who has the capability to stick it out, to give the good guys the victory they desperately need? This calls for a special team. The group of experienced, highly skilled, professional, team-oriented experts? Not them. The assorted group of ex-con lowlife inexperienced jerkasses who are trying to off their commander when they aren't going at each other? Yeah, them.\nThis is usually justified in one of several ways:\nOf course, the Ragtag Bunch of Misfits will eventually have a Misfit Mobilization Moment to get their act together and win the day. Most often it produces casualties: typically, the guy forced to go on the mission despite being the Convicted Innocent, or the Officer and a Gentleman who's been stodgy and uptight just before making a Heroic Sacrifice.\nIf the characters were not forced on the team\u2014Condemned Contestant, Boxed Crook\u2014they often join to be Lonely Together. To contrast their diversity, their enemies will likely be all homogenous in one way, typically by being highly collaborative professionals.\nCompare with Character-Magnetic Team and Hitchhiker Heroes.\nIn the world of sports, this trope counts double. Last year's Super Bowl champions don't stand a chance against a random group of ex-cons, couch potatoes, and farm animals, with Improvised Training, who are almost guaranteed to pull out a last-minute win.\nAlso where the trope is shown in the context of sports (or dance teams), you will typically find a three-game arc of progress. In the first game, it's Murphy's Law. The game is a comedy of errors for our ragtag gang of misfits, and they lose. Bad. Ridiculously bad. In the second game, the team sees notable improvement; usually they'll play well enough, only to lose at the last minute. Occasionally, they might even win on a freak play. By the third game, however, everyone has clicked and is playing at the top of their game. From that point on, it's all smooth sailing until The Big Game. (Often times, their opponent in The Big Game will be the same team that blew them out in the first game, just as a ways to show how far they've come.)\nSubtrope to The Team. Similarly, Ragtag Bunches Of Misfits come in any size, the Power Trio, Five-Man Band, Magnificent Seven Samurai and even Army of Thieves and Whores for when this trope is magnified to the size of an army. Recruit Teenagers with Attitude is a frequent subtrope.\n"}
{"NewContentCountdownClock": "Now that the age of internet is upon us, and cable and satellite have made TV a 24 hour active paradigm, viewers, readers and surfers don't necessarily sit around stuck to one location once they've finished consuming their medium of choice.\nTelevision shows have a finite number of episodes, and when they're out, many channels either fill up the slot with new content, filler, or just play the same episodes over and over again until the new season is ready. When a book is done, there's usually a year or more until the next installment. Web content updates depending on the style of the page.\nTo drum up excitement and anticipation for the release of new material, popular media will have a New Content Countdown Clock which sits (not at all unobtrusively) in the corner of the screen counting down the hours and minutes until the most anticipated new material.\nParticularly egregious cases (at least in the case of TV) will have the clock fixed in place so that it's even present in the corner of the screen during the commercial breaks.\nMay often appear \u2014 on TV at least \u2014 at the end of a Theme Week or Marathon.\nSister Trope to Commercial Pop-Up.\n"}
{"ItsAWonderfulFailure": "Some particularly cruel game developers aren't satisfied with just telling them how badly they lost \u2014 they have to show that the player failed through an alternate Downer Ending in which players are forced to endure the terrible fate that awaits the characters they were supposed to be helping. They didn't just get a Game Over where they can reload and everything's fine - they FAILED. They failed and now they will live just long enough to see the Big Bad claim victory and to see the END OF THEIR CIVILIZATION. This has the effect of getting players so upset that they are inclined to Set Right What Once Went Wrong and retry the game.\nIf done right, it will end up being very, very depressing, especially for younger gamers, and thus a very strong incentive to not die. If it's a cartoon action game that features cute, playable characters, be warned: The Game Over scene may show them in a pitiful, humiliating state of powerless defeat. It may, however, become very annoying when the game is hard and requires the player to try and fail over and over. Either way, there's no shaking that sense that the game developers just stuck their big pointing fingers at the gamer, saying \"You Bastard!. Look what you did to your favorite character... take a good, long look. You caused this - not us.\"\nThis is often a Non-Standard Game Over, though a few games use this trope as the standard failure. Compare Have a Nice Death, Shoot the Shaggy Dog and The Bad Guy Wins. Not to be confused with Fission Mailed, which is non-sarcastically wonderful. This is for game overs, for just dying see The Many Deaths of You. See also Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!, a situation where the hero failed to do his heroism the right way. Earn Your Bad Ending may mix with this if the player has to go out of his/her way to watch this.\nThis is a death trope. Expect lots of marked and unmarked spoilers ahead.\n"}

{"AreaOfEffect": "Some effects, rather than having a single target, affect everything within a given area. This area is the \"area of effect\", and attacks/buffs that work this way are called area of effect attacks/buffs. Popular in Tabletop Games and Strategy Games, area of effect attacks are very useful for taking out large numbers of weak enemies simultaneously. However, they'll usually avert Friendly Fireproof, adding another layer of strategy to their use. They aren't necessarily offensive in nature, either \u2014 healing or protection abilities often work in an area of effect as well.\nSuper Trope to Splash Damage, but while splash damage falls off the farther away you get from the center of the attack, area of effect attacks affect everything in its area equally. Supertrope to Herd-Hitting Attack. See also Splash Damage Abuse, when an Area Of Effect is abused to get enhanced performance out of the ability.

{"CliffhangerCopOut": "Cliffhangers tend to be a vital part of any serial story. They stop the action or drama right when tension is at its highest, leaving an audience on the edge of their seats in anticipation of a conflict resolution and wanting to stick around to see what happens next.\nThe best cliffhangers pick up the story right where it left off and provide a clear resolution based off of everything that was shown to have occurred to viewers in the previous installment. And then there's these...\nUnfortunately, sometimes writers may discover that they've written themselves into a corner with no way to resolve a cliffhanger based on how the prior episode, chapter, film, or story ended. When this problem arises, the writer may make a saving throw to cheat his way out of the problem in one of a few ways:\nIf handled well enough, most viewers may not notice it, or even care all that much if they take the MST3K Mantra to heart. If not, a lot of people are going to feel duped and not very pleased with what they were rewarded with for their dedicated viewership.\nCan be observed frequently in old Film Serials of the 1930s-40s, as the quote at the top of the page might suggest; it also makes this trope just slightly Older Than Television.\nSee also What Cliffhanger, when circumstances surrounding the cliffhanger are deliberately vague and without any sense of drama or suspense to motivate viewers to stick around for more.\nCompare Red Herring Twist. Pseudo Crisis is a subtrope. Contrast Once More, with Clarity!, in which new facts about the situation are revealed without retroactively changing the old ones. Has nothing to do with the movies Cliffhanger or Cop Out.\nAlso, this being an Ending Trope, be prepared for **Spoilers Ahead!**\n"}
{"BlackAndWhiteMagic": "Okay, you're designing an RPG, and you've got your Fighter, Mage, Thief, but something's missing. The magic adds a lot of strategic elements to the combat system, and you don't want to have just one magic user. You want to add more variety. But you can't just create a copy of the mage; it has to be different somehow. So how to make the two mages distinct? Simple. Have one attack and the other heal!\nBlack And White Magic is a common way of having more than one magician character or class while having them remain distinct. One of the mages specializes in offensive magic which causes damage, negative status, or otherwise harms the enemy, while the other specializes in defensive magic to cure their allies, remove negative status, or increase their own stats. They are often referred to as \"wizard\" and \"cleric\" (or some variation) respectively.\nNot to be confused with Black Magic and White Magic, which are distinct tropes and don't usually overlap with this. If a character can do both, then he's The Red Mage. Characters who use black magic are Black Mages, characters who use white magic are White Mages.\n"}
{"UnusuallyUninterestingName": "When something is generally implied to be more important or special because someone went out of their way to make the name as uninteresting and nondescriptive as possible. This might be because they want to avoid drawing attention to the unit, hiding it in the sea of boring names for various unimportant agencies, or just because the sort of badass who works there finds the bravado-filled names of many elite units to be distasteful. For various reasons, very common in many modern Western armed forces.\nA savvy character might try to bluff his way past an obstacle by identifying themselves as a member of some completely fictional agency, as long as the name is intimidatingly vague enough to make the other person think better than to investigate.\nOf course, sometimes an agency has such a bland name because it really isn't all that important, and nobody involved could be bothered to try and come up with a good name for it.\nA Super Trope to Room 101 and The Group; Related to Maximum Fun Chamber.

{"TooManyMouths": "In the same way that having extra eyes in unusual places can be unnerving, a creature with extra mouths can also be horrific, in a different way. The mouth is the organ of consumption, so a creature can be given extra mouths to show that it is a ravenous, hungry monstrosity. A massive paunch and lack of other sensory organs will create the image of an organism with no intelligence or purpose other than to eat.\nTo enhance the effect of the mouths, they may be equipped with More Teeth than the Osmond Family, or alternatively, might be gross and wide orifices with a thick tongue and smacking lips.\nBut there are many other ways to add mouths, and many places. They can be obvious or discreet, even hidden. They may even have special properties or powers. Their owner can be an Eldritch Abomination or a seemingly-normal human, or anything in between.\nSometimes the extra mouths will be able to speak separately, which probably isn't very useful for communicating, but allow Magical Incantations to be performed several at once.\nA Super Trope to Belly Mouth, Vagina Dentata, Nested Mouths. Compare Two-Faced, contrast No Mouth.\n"}
{"MagicPoweredPseudoscience": "Phlebotinum thought by its creators to work on scientific principles, at least according to their Techno Babble. Actually, it's powered by some supernatural or magical ability of the creator and cannot be duplicated. Also, if the creator dies, it stops working or malfunctions. Often, these gizmos can only be created by someone who possess The Spark of Genius.\nBecoming an increasingly popular way to explain science-fiction style super-gizmos in Speculative Fiction settings. It's a good way to justify why Reed Richards Is Useless and there's No Plans, No Prototype, No Backup. These wondrous inventions cannot be mass-produced to improve mankind or make their creator a profit because they're not actual inventions so much as temporary manifestations of their subconscious superhuman abilities. Thus, application of them will usually boil down to either fighting crime or committing it. The setting maintains the status quo of the real-world's level of technology and the Gadgeteer Genius gets to keep all of their Phlebotinum to themselves and not risk becoming less unique because the Jones family can purchase his powers from Walmart.\nA subtrope of Doing In the Scientist.\nRelated to Clap Your Hands If You Believe, Magitek and Placebotinum Effect.

For that matter, why are you still alive, after being whacked in the head with his axe a few times? It seems all that stuff saying you should Never Bring a Knife to a Fist Fight was complete baloney. (Well, except for the not dying part.)\nCompare Strong Flesh, Weak Steel, As Lethal as It Needs to Be and Made of Iron. Contrast Nerf Arm.\n"}
{"SoloTabletopGame": "In general, Tabletop Games are designed with at least 2-3 players in mind. Often there's no way to automate the physical base game, needing human players to make the decisions for each side. In the case of many Tabletop RPGs, a Game Master is required to full the various roles that the players could not, otherwise the story would be spoiled.\nBut Solo Tabletop Games avert this - they could be played with just one player.\nSo why would anyone play them alone? Well, someone could be they live in a small town where few share their interest in Tabletop Gaming. Others just want to be alone. Though many probably just want to get the most use out of their purchases (Most hobby Tabletop games cost at least $20-60, with some being $100+).\nWhatever the reason, games can make this possible because of their mechanics: dice rolling and separate card decks that determine what sort of challenges or effects that occur. Others provide a solitaire variant, turning a game into a self imposed challenge. Another way is the game comes with an \"AI\" - in this case, a set of actions and rules that trigger based on what card is drawn, roll results, or player decisions.\nThere's plenty of House Rules by fans to allow their favorite games for solo play. To help narrow things down, examples listed as variants should be official.\n"}
{"Subject101": "In many academic systems, introductory courses for a field of study are designated \"101\". That the course is \"100-level\" indicates that it is intended for beginning or first-year students. That the course is numbered \"101\" (or occasionally \"100\") indicates that it is the first such course.\nMany subjects actually taught will have at least one 100-level course, especially in fiction. The ones that don't are usually specialized subjects. Occasionally, a fictional 101 course will be way more or less advanced than the course number justifies. Not infrequently 101 will be the only class level ever mentioned. Its ubiquity even allows a character to mark himself as a university student or professor by mentioning (Subject) 101.\nThe notation of a course as 101 means that it is expected that anyone with normal intelligence and work ethic and minimal talent in the field can successfully complete it, and will thereby acquire the basics of the discipline; also, that anyone with the basics of the discipline will know any fact labeled \"subject 101\". This connotation leads to the common subtrope \"Arcana 101\", in which a writer tries to give an accessible flavor to some exotic discipline through introducing it by means of a (usually fictional) 101 course. The sarcastic variant is \"Inanity 101\", in which the 101 course is in some subject for which it would be unreasonable to expect training to be necessary or useful. The trope title falls more or less under this variant.\nDue to Eagleland Osmosis, \"(Subject) 101\" is often used by non-Americans who have no idea where the phrase comes from \u2014 though some British universities have adopted the system, and it is used in Australia.\nNot to be confused with Always in Class One (the equivalent would be the earliest offering of the week for (Subject) 101) or Room 101 (no matter how much you might hate the class).\n"}
{"EvilIsCold": "Evil is not only dark, it is also cold and deadly, while good embodies warmth and life as well as light.\nMuch more likely for the Big Bad or Evil Overlord than pettier sorts of villains. Tends to factor into Fisher King. Whereas Good is probably located in the Ghibli Hills or Arcadia, Evil is invariably located in the Grim Up North or the \"icy wasteland\" version of Mordor.\nVery common for the Undead. Even ghosts leave conspicuous cold spots where they wander.\nCan feature with a Winter Royal Lady or An Ice Person, but does not have to; ice can also be an elemental power unrelated to good vs. evil. The key is whether the cold is used as an indicator of evil and death. It will be more destructive than other elemental powers in this trope. Evil items like the Artifact of Doom may exhibit this as Thermal Dissonance; they're always cold no matter where you put them.\nThe obvious foil to Fertile Feet. Indeed, it may not be clear in a story whether the return of sunshine, life, and warmth is owning to the hero's influence or because the Big Bad's has No Ontological Inertia. (Babies Ever After may coincide with this \u2014 or function as a mundane alternative.)\nThe elemental opposite is Evil Is Burning Hot.\nMay be a factor in why Spring Is Late is such a dangerous trope.\nNot to be confused with Evil Is Cool.\n"}
{"LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards": "Melee classes gain power at a linear rate as they level up. Magic users gain power quadratically as they level up.\nA quirk some Video Game and Tabletop RPG game systems share is that melee classes are more powerful, versatile or useful at lower levels than casters or magic-using classes. However, the trend reverses at higher levels, when the magic users gain a breadth of both versatility and pure power over simplistic hack and slash heroes.\nThe divide is usually exacerbated by the ease with which a young warrior can go wading into combat compared to a novice mage. The fighter just needs decent armor and a weapon, and with their marvelous Hit Points, they can get into the thick of things and do reasonably well. Magical weapons aren't required but can (usually) be used immediately and give amazing bonuses. Wizards, on the other hand (especially young/low level ones), have no such easy shortcuts to massive magical power; they have to study, find or invent spells, and discover magic items that aren't so powerful they cause them to go into a Superpower Meltdown. In the meantime, they are nearly defenseless in a fight.\nYet the trend reverses at higher levels. As the trope name says, the power of a warrior is linear. It grows at a steady pace whose increase can be predicted by simple arithmetic. But a wizard's power is quadratic or even exponential: as it grows, the rate of growth also gets multiplied. For example, learning something such as a spell leads to multiple, often unpredictable, varieties of more things to learn, in a manner similar to how a single infected person can infect multiple people unpredictably, or how a Wiki Walk on TV Tropes or The Other Wiki forces you to follow more links which lead to discovery of more varieties of knowledge and tropes which have lots of interesting links themselves that lead to more countless instances of discovering tropes, and so on. Thus, in the end wizards must at some point become the more powerful class. For example, while warriors are still stuck at physical hacking and slashing, wizards have discovered how to warp reality itself.\nWhether it's the game designers intentionally \"making up\" for lots of frailty for many levels, or a quirk that comes up during play, the wizard simply outpaces all but the most Min Maxed and Munchkined out warriors.\nThis isn't just a Sour Grapes complaint against Squishy Wizards or a lack of Competitive Balance throughout the game, but can be a deliberate thematic choice.\nFirst off, the idea that Reality Ensues for warriors at some point. They hit the limits of human (or near-human) ability and can't bend physics any farther. Since warriors don't have magic, how is physical force supposed to beat, say, an intangible ghost or some supernatural baddie with the magical ability to ignore it? Basically, warriors can only be so fantastic, so even as they improve, those improvements mean less.\nSecondly, in such a setting, there may be dozens if not hundreds of small-time mystic dabblers, but they quickly thin in numbers, only to resurface as potent adventuring wizards, culminating in the classic mystic powerhouse like Gandalf or Elminster, or the Evil Sorcerer in the Evil Tower of Ominousness. Meanwhile, the Conans and Beowulfs have the run of the place, being able to both solo and group. In essence, the mages study under the promise of a dull and complex path with great profits at the end.\nThirdly, there's more than a bit of Wish Fulfillment here. Gamers, and by extension game designers, tend to be nerds by definition. The notion that a wizard (generally something of a brainy bookworm) may start out weaker than the Dumb Muscle, but surpass them entirely in the endgame, proving that knowledge is power that can modify the environment itself, thus making large muscles redundant in comparison? This account holds a lot of inherent appeal to them.\nHowever, if this results from a development mistake, or enough complaints convince the author/programmer to change things, there are ways to limit the awesomeness of wizards. These include restrictions on magic itself, the two classic examples being the Mana mechanic or the even more restrictive Vancian Magic. Both of these serve to cap how often a wizard can cast spells. Preventing casting spells while wearing armour is another, though this is often partially countered by providing a range of protective magics that work much like normal armour only better, but of course for a limited time. Other restrictions also exist; a common one is simply to make the wizard Squishy. Others involve sanity and corruption systems, or making the casting of a spell a tactically debilitating act.\nAs you can imagine, players who specifically chose wizards and worked hard to keep them alive with the promise of great power for their effort can be...upset by this game balancing Nerfing, unless (and sometimes especially because) it also beefs up wizards at low levels. The solution is rarely to power up warriors while only slightly depowering wizards generally because, at least in the West, there's an expectation that the warrior be a Badass Normal that you can more easily imagine that you could become with enough effort.\nThese fixes can result in or from some pretty strange logic and situations. Sure, the wizard can do more amazing and effective stuff than the warrior can, but the warrior can do his less impressive things indefinitely! That makes up for it, right?... Well, sometimes. A tough flurry of Random Encounters can suck a mage's supply of game breaking magic, which will force them to save a bit of juice for that final boss, and not waste their power. But in some games, wizards can recover their magic faster as they level up, and other games have infinitely available elixirs that recover magic quickly. Still other times, you end up with the opposite problem, wizards whose capacity to fight is so restricted that you wonder why the warriors even bother to bring them along (when this makes sense, it's because of the Inverse Law of Utility and Lethality being applied).\nIn games that involve both PvP and singleplayer vs AI gameplay, especially the ones that require you to play both to advance on either, the base game theory and thus Metagame can be completely different from if they were seperated, which makes\nfanbases even less pleasable. \nTropes Are Not Bad is still in effect however, and some well-thought out games encourage a party to have Warriors to pull them through the early levels and then sit back and watch the mages repay them later on and neither a all-warrior or all-mage team would have succeeded. The problem largely lies in how many times the Mage overshoots the warrior rather early on, rather than say, halfway through.\nAttempts to keep warriors' capabilities \"normal\" are far less prevalent in works of Eastern origin which are more likely to give their warriors Charles Atlas Superpower, and so the trope has weakened slightly in the minds of the younger generation. Other character types, such as the Magic Knight, the Kung-Fu Wizard, and practitioners of Full-Contact Magic, mingle both styles of fighting to their own advantage by either using magic to augment raw strength or training their physical abilities to \"power up\" their magical attacks.\nA subtrope of Changing Gameplay Priorities. See also Magikarp Power for cases of weak things that become stronger after enough effort, like the wizard in this case. If the game itself scales alongside the quadratic wizard growth, then it can sometimes result in a Parabolic Power Curve for other classes, since they'll fall further and further behind the more levels they gain.\nThere are quite a few cases where this is the inverse: \"Wizards don't need equipment to be more useful\" turns into \"Wizards can't use equipment to be more useful\", and Fighters with their attack speed, critical strikes, weapons that deal higher damage, and so on, eventually outpace Wizards, whose power comes simply from the spell's level that cannot be increased any further. A curious recurring inversion that's exclusive almost entirely to JRPGs owes its existence to the concept of a damage cap: in attempt to help the Fighters overcome this trope, games sometimes (if their Agility or a similar stat is high enough) allow them to deal several attacks in one turn by pressing \"Attack\" once - and if every instance of damage is capped out at 999, it doesn't matter how powerful and flashy a Wizard's spell is, since it only hits once, compared to a Fighter's twenty attacks.\n"}
{"InfanticideBackfire": "The Big Bad (often an Evil Overlord) has just learned that a child that can defeat them has been or soon will be born. The obvious solution to this problem is to Screw Destiny. Nip this danger in the bud and kill the infant Hero before they can become any kind of threat. This is the stage where the problems crop up. Either the Big Bad has no idea who this child actually is, or other characters also aware of this destiny have taken the initiative to hide and protect the child before the Big Bad can actually reach them. Or the would-be killer thinks they've done the deed, but unbeknownst to them, some force or benevolent person intervenes and the child is actually Not Quite Dead. Or, the Big Bad sent a mook to do it, but the mook either can't go through with it, or botches the whole thing through incompetence. Whatever the mechanism, the upshot is that You Can't Fight Fate.\nOften the only thing to do in cases where they can't identify the child is to attempt to track down the newborn hero, baby-by-baby if necessary. The Big Bad will investigate or, if impatient, simply kill any child in the proper age range to attempt to secure their safety \u2014 this may result in a Childless Dystopia if he's thorough enough. Inevitably, it never works, and if innocent children are killed, the resultant crossing of the Moral Event Horizon makes clear just how bad the villain is - and of course karmically seals their fate. Worse yet, this act often directly backfires, giving the hunted newborn a reason beyond mere prophecy to go after the Big Bad after he's grown up enough to take him on; this is a common Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.\nThis being a form of Villain Ball, it almost never occurs to anyone that a wiser thought might be to try to find and raise the child himself. Though you might occasionally see it among smarter villains, who take the view that the kid might love him too much to finish him or, in the worst case scenario, will be close at hand if he does Heel\u2013Face Turn. This often doesn't work either, though, and is irrelevant if the prophecy is that the child will defeat him. Then again, all that's needed for the Prophecy to be fulfilled is for the would-be slayer turned protege to become The Starscream (and be successful).\nSister Trope to Genocide Backfire, with which it can and does overlap. The primary difference is that this trope is specific to a Big Bad trying to find a newborn Hero before they can be a threat. No more, no less. Genocide need not be a part of the method. The main factor for whether or not such a situation is this trope is if the genocide is merely a means to an end (Kill Tribe A to prevent the rise of Child B) or an end in itself (Kill Tribe A to stop any rising, period).\nAlso compare Offing the Offspring for those occasions when the child is the son or daughter of the Big Bad. See also Infant Immortality, which is, in writing terms, one of the primary reasons this rarely succeeds. If Time Travel is involved, see Make Wrong What Once Went Right.\nNot to be confused with Nice Job Breaking It, Hero! However, it can be related to Nice Job Fixing It, Villain!\n"}
{"PressXToDie": "The player is given the option to perform an action that can only ever result in failure or otherwise hinder progress. Rather than simply disabling the action, the developers instead let the player try it, and then punish them for it. Most of the time it's just Schmuck Bait included as a joke, but some especially sadistic developers add such things with no, or little, warning in games where Continuing Is Painful.\nSome games provide such a command as a suicide command for fun, quick level resets or when the current level is left in an unsolvable state. Often a Puzzle Reset, but in MMORPGs may provide a bug workaround.\nOverlaps with No Fair Cheating in cases where X used to be a cheat code in an earlier game.\nSome games (mostly puzzle games) also use this as a sort of Reset Button so the player can suicide (or rather, lose some progress) and restart if they get stuck.\nSometimes results from a Leap of Faith, and often results in Yet Another Stupid Death or possibly Nonstandard Game Over. When you're instead rewarded for taking an obviously stupid action, that's a Violation of Common Sense. If the stupid action is required in order to solve a puzzle or advance the plot, then Stupidity Is the Only Option. See Press Start to Game Over for when the Trolling Creator puts a suicidal option right at the beginning of the game. Contrast Press X to Not Die.\nSub trope of Forbidden Chekhov's Gun.\n"}
{"TheMinionMaster": "Whereas Beastmasters usually focus on quality of minions, often restricting themselves to one or two (or at least one at a time), The Minion Master on the other hand focuses on sheer, undiluted numbers. This often makes for an unusual and difficult-to-balance character build- a character whose power comes from brutally outnumbering his opponents often leaves himself as the squishiest of Squishy Wizards, and enemies either succumb quickly to the Death of a Thousand Cuts or perform a minion version of a Total Party Wipe with area of effect attacks. They may also possess skills to control and buff their minions. The Minion Master tends to, of course, to be the keystone in his Keystone Army that is the prime target to finish first.\nThe key factor in determining if a particular character, class, unit or build is The Minion Master is this: Can the character outnumber a typical squad of Mooks on their own? If the answer is yes, then the character is The Minion Master.\nZerg Rush often describes the most common combat method of The Minion Master. Because of their tactics, they often fall under Anti-Hero and Dark Is Not Evil characterization. Can occasionally be Game Breakers, occasionally Crutch Characters. If the minions are copies of the master, it's a Doppleganger Attack.\nA subtrope of The Beastmaster, and supertrope to Pest Controller.\nCompare Assist Character, an NPC in Fighting Games that can be briefly summoned to assist the Player Character; Drone Deployer, a character that carries their minions upon their person and \"deploys\" them when they're to be used; Enemy Summoner, a video-game enemy that summons other enemies while also directly fighting the player; Mook Commander, a mook with the ability to strengthen other mooks just by their presence; Mook Maker, where the producer of mooks may be an inanimate device rather than an actual character; and The Turret Master, who instead of minions uses technology.\n"}
{"BookShelfDominoes": "In the library or archive, there are always stacks upon stacks of books, and so many bookcases in so many rows. The fight begins, and a bookcase falls... into its neighbor, which falls onto its neighbor, and causes a chain reaction that levels the whole library.\nSee also: Disaster Dominoes, the Super Trope.\nThis is not possible in Real Life, as bookcases are both designed to be very stable, and when loaded with books, are very heavy. Also, most library bookcases are anchored.\n"}
{"SuperpowerRussianRoulette": "Who wants to be a superhero? Everyone, duh...as long as he's not a superhero already, anyway. Kids who idolize them, teens desperate for a change in their lives, adults who think they could make the world a better place... and, of course, those with less savory motives.\nFor any of these people, the day they get caught in a Mass Super-Empowering Event and win the Superpower Lottery would probably be the happiest day of their lives. But sometimes a Mass Super Empowering Event isn't a lottery. Sometimes it's a deadly game of Russian Roulette, where only a handful of people affected walk away with superpowers \u2014 the rest become crippled, horribly deformed, killed, or worse.\nThe roulette has different kinds of ammunition to hit the contestants with, often they compound:\n"}
{"SapientFurTrade": "People can find hundreds of reasons to kill other people. Most of them are emotional, like hatred and anger, while some, like money, are more pragmatic.\nThis practice, though, takes pragmatism to a whole new level: people are killed, usually on a race-wide scale, because their dead bodies provide useful raw materials.\nThis will be most common and obvious in a fur trade, where the skins of another race of people are bought and sold for material or trophies, but as people tend to be creative beings potential uses are limited only by their imagination.\nThis will usually not be perpetrated within a race, or people who believe themselves to be the same race. Normally the hunter race will believe for some reason that the hunted race aren't actually people, either from misunderstanding or because it suits them to make artificial distinctions.\nOn the other hand, if they do know precisely what they're doing, expect either for the two races to be mortal enemies or for the hunter race to be portrayed as morally irredeemable.\nA Sub-Trope of Fur and Loathing.\nA Super Trope to Genuine Human Hide.\nCompare I'm a Humanitarian (particularly if the raw material people are being killed for is food), Cruella to Animals (being cruel whether or not the animals are sapient), Desecrating the Dead, Organ Theft.\nContrast Live Mink Coat (an animal is worn, but not harmed).\n"}
{"LimitedUseMagicalDevice": "The limited-serving, Fun Size version of a Spell Book, a Limited Use Magical Device generally contains a single spell or a handful of spells or \"uses\" of a single spell, that is cast instantly on being activated, after which the item either becomes inert or is destroyed. They most often take the form of a scroll, but are not necessarily limited to them.\nThis is most often seen in Video Games and Tabletop Games using Vancian Magic systems; such an item often bypasses the usual spellcasting requirements such as material components, spell slots, and/or Mana costs, and sometimes even allows non-spellcasters to cast the contained spell.\nCompare and contrast Spell Book, which is usually non-consumable and permanently teaches the reader one or more spells. Compare Breakable Weapons for melee weapons with this trait.\nThis is not necessarily the same as a magical object that can only be used for one purpose, but there can be some overlap.\n"}
{"AppealToVanity": "The Appeal to Vanity is a logical fallacy that consists of, well, Exactly What It Says on the Tin: appealing to the vanity, pride, or self-esteem of the person being spoken to, in order to get them to do something, buy something, or give something up.\nIt's widely used in advertising, most often by products perceived or presented as \"elite\" or \"high end\", but also by cutting edge technology, where implications that owning the product will act as an indicator of one's status in the social order are used. An integral part of Up Marketing.\nHowever, it's not limited only to advertising. The Appeal to Vanity is an integral part of the Yes-Man's tool box and it's a common trope in folk tales, where a person is persuaded to do something against their best interests by another character who flatters them. In fact, it's Older Than Feudalism, with one of the earliest known examples, \"The Fable of The Fox and The Crow\", existing in its current form at least as far back as the 1st Century CE. It might even be Older Than Dirt, since a vase illustrated with what appears to be the story was found in an archaeological dig in India of a civilization that dates to around 2400 BCE.\n"}
{"TeamNormal": "In a nutshell, any team of superpowered people will often have members without powers.\nSo when the majority of the members are a Flying Brick, have mystical skills, wear Powered Armor, wear a Ring of Power, have a Charles Atlas Superpower, or even heart, The Team Normal has nothing. Okay, they can be really smart and have gadgets, but nothing that could confuse them for superpowered people (at least not unless that's what they want you to think).\nThese Sister Tropes are the most common ways this character is part of a team (just not the only ways):\nAgain, in order to count for this trope, a character has to be part of a team, and the majority of the team has to have some kind of powers.\nCompare Team Pet, Team Mom, Team Dad, Muggle, What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway? (when the character has powers on the team, just the weakest), Story-Breaker Team-Up (all members of a team-up have superpowers, but one is so strong, the rest might as well be normal). Opposite trope to the Token Super.\n"}
{"FalseMemories": "Sometimes when Laser-Guided Amnesia won't cut it, the villains, heroes, or The Men in Black need to radically alter a subject's very memories to ensure their Evil Plan, Epiphany Therapy or cover-up (respectively) works flawlessly.\nIn these cases they implant Fake Memories, using things like Psychic Powers, brainwashing, computers, or the week's Applied Phlebotinum to replace true memories with more convenient false ones.\nOf course, this never works as planned. Like an itch they can't scratch, the character with tampered memories will notice things aren't as they should be and scratch at the false memories like a scab, questioning their \"Past\" and searching for the truth. Or go crazy trying. Occasionally, a hero will leave a Note to Self or instructions for friends to help. The irony being that the false memories tend to lead the character right back to the people who erased them with enough of an advantage to take them out.\nA darker, more sinister version of this trope is when the character in question realizes his memories don't add up, but doesn't know which set of memories is true. Often self-inflicted, these memories are slowly revealed through dream sequences, and the experience tends to come with An Aesop about the frailty of human mind and the subjectivity of memory.\nQuite common in video games, probably because amnesiac heroes are extremely convenient for the format. Occasionally used as part of a more radical attempt at making someone into an Unperson.\nRelated tropes include Manchurian Agent, Memory Gambit, Amnesiac Dissonance, and Tomato in the Mirror. Compare Exposition Beam.\n"}
{"WarGaming": "A genre of tabletop games centering around the simulation of warfare, based on either real conflicts or fantasy scenarios. Some games include highly detailed miniatures and maps; however, most games of this genre consist of one or more maps of the theatre of conflict, a variable number of unit counters (small square pieces of heavy cardstock with printed numbers and symbols representing military units, as well as markers of various sorts), and rules with accompanying tables and charts. The most important such table is a \"Combat Results Table\", giving a set of battle results calculated according to the numerical odds of attacker versus defender; the players roll dice and compare the resulting numbers to the table to see how the battle came out. Table wargames can focus on any level of battle from literally man-to-man combat (e.g., the Squad Leader series) to whole army groups or fleets. Expansion Packs with different scenarios are also common.\nThe Ur Examples are Chess (invented in ancient India) and Go (invented in ancient China), which laid the foundations for wargaming. The Trope Maker is possibly Kriegsspiel (1812), literally, \"War Game,\" which was created by two Prussian officers, Lieutenant Georg Leopold von Reiswitz and his son Georg Heinrich Rudolf von Reiswitz. The game, intended to be a more modern realistic adaptation of Chess, was widely played by the Prussian officers of the 19th Century, and after some stunning Prussian victories, military officers around Europe. It was Serious Business from the very beginning; Kriegsspiel was endorsed by the General Staff of Prussia as an invaluable teaching aid. Kriegsspiel was the Trope Codifier for a lot of conventions used by current military thinkers, military historians, war gamers, and table top role players. It codified the use of the colors red and blue for enemy and friendly forces, respectively, the use of maps and miniaturised scale terrain, detailed movement rules and turns, referees and game masters, specialized dice, the block symbols for units, table quarters, Loads and Loads of Rules, the Random Number God, the core rulebook, Rule Zero, and so on. It was so influential that it is still available today. A great many of the concepts used to create training simulations for modern officers and table top wargames today would seem completely familiar to the Reiswitzes, even despite technology they could never have imagined. The eminent author H. G. Wells was also responsible for several more light-hearted and simplified sets of rule conventions for wargame simulations \u2014Floor Games (1911) and Little Wars (1913)\u2014 which were popular in Great Britain before World War I, and which had a strong influence on the later development of the wargaming hobby in the UK.\nAfter World War II, the game evolved again. The original Kriegsspiel used only symbolic blocks to represent units. Little Wars advocated use of what were then standard 54mm or 3.5\" toy soldiers. in the 1950s, with the rise of firms such as Hinchcliffe or Spencer-Smith who sold 25mm or 1:72 scale metal figures, new thinkers such as the hugely influential Donald Featherstone (who had commanded tanks in North Africa and Italy) advocated far larger battles over the same size table using figures 3/4 of the size. Featherstone's new rule-sets and advocacy of using smaller scales also coincided with the rise in cheap, small, plastic figures, and construction kits of tanks and artillery; like those made with injection moulding by the Airfix brand.\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, several companies (chief among them Avalon Hill, Simulations Publications Inc., and Game Designers' Workshop) produced literally hundreds of games covering every era of warfare from the ancient period to science fiction and Alternate History. In many ways a return to classical Kreigsspiel format, these games ranged in size from tiny \"folio\" games with perhaps 100 counters and maps no larger than a standard sheet of paper, to gigantic \"monster\" games with 9 or more 22\" x 34\" maps and thousands of counters. By the end of the 1970s, the biggest \"monster\" wargames (for instance, SPI's \"Campaign for North Africa\") were so complex and unwieldy that they were pretty much unplayable as actual games in the traditional table format. Also of note: Role-playing games, in their pencil-and-paper-and-rulebook format, first became popular in the late 1970s. There used to be some amount of tension between devotees of board wargaming and RPG players.\nSince the early 1980s (and to a degree, before) the advent of home computers resulted in wargames mostly transitioning to the realm of electronics, since it was much easier to program the often-complex math required to accurately simulate many military events than to try to create tables and charts for table wargames. These games evolved into the genres we now call Turn-Based Strategy and, later still, Real-Time Strategy. Even so, there is still a hard core of dedicated map-and-counter-and-dice wargamers and companies to serve them, as well as numerous conventions large and small at which gamers can meet to play games and buy and sell them.\nSince circa 2000, the board wargaming hobby has enjoyed something of a renaissance due, in part, to the revived popularity of tabletop games. Just as in the 1970's, games range in physical size from \"folio\" games (Decision Games has published several games that can use as few as 40 counters to represent all the units present at a given battle) to \"monsters\" with thousands of counters and numerous maps (e.g., Compass Games' Absolute Victory, a grand-strategic-level treatment of World War II intended as a revamping and expansion of the Australian Design Group's classic World in Flames, which covers not only the entire Western Hemisphere but even includes a map for Antarctica!). As of the late 2010's, Decision Games (which owns the SPI trademark and the copyrights to most of the classic SPI line), GMT Games, and Compass Games are the leading publishers in the hobby, augmented by smaller publishers such as Avalanche Press and One Small Step Games. These companies both publish new designs and re-print classic 1970's and 1980's games; for instance, Avalanche Press has republished the 1974 Avalon Hill classic Third Reich and paired it with an original design, The Great Pacific War, covering the war in East Asia and the Pacific, which uses the same system as Third Reich and can be mated with the European game to present the entirety of World War II. Decision Games, which now owns the rights to publish SPI's legendary Strategy and Tactics magazine-with-game, publishes the magazine on a bimonthly basis, along with two other similar magazines with a more specific focus; World at War, specializing in World War II, and Modern War, focusing on contemporary and near-future conflict. Both of these magazines, like S&T, are available in magazine-only versions as well as versions with game supplements.\nProving that older ideas recycle, the Nottingham-based company Games Workshop began operations in the early 1980s selling fantasy and sci-fi wargaming from its dedicated shop outlets around the country. Despite computer games and map-and-counter-based games still having a foothold, and despite the dominant trend in the tabletop wargaming-with-figures hobby being historical gaming (Napoleonics and WW2 still dominate), GW carved out its own little empire, securing the alliegience and pocket-money of adolescent boys, who are the next generation of the hobby. In a time where traditional model and figure makers such as Airfix repeatedly went bust, GW have gone from strength to strength. And GW's other innovation stuck. \"Traditional\" wargaming with figures revolves around two scales: 20-25mm (1:76 to 1:72) or the older 1:35 (54mm), GW chose the intermediate 28mm (1:57 scale). This has proven very popular and has been taken up by many other figure manufacturers. The figures do not take up anything like as much table space as the comparatively huge 54mm's. They are also large enough to carry a lot of fine detail which a skilled artist can bring out. While 20 and 15 mm figures can provide an impressive spectacle en masse, the observer has often got to squint to make out individual detail. This is not an issue in 28mm.\nSee also After-Action Report, Common Tactical Gameplay Elements, Random Number God, Turn-Based Combat, and Turn-Based Tactics.\n"}
{"FantasticArousal": "So you have some Half Human Hybrids? What about Petting Zoo People? Rubber-Forehead Aliens? Cute Monster Girls? Well, be careful. If a character has some form of non-human anatomy (ears, wings, especially tails), chances are that said physical feature will be\u2026 sensitive. Even characters who look mostly human may have erogenous zones in odd areas to establish that they have Bizarre Alien Biology or Bizarre Alien Reproduction. For obvious reasons, this leads to a lot of I Didn't Mean to Turn You On type incidents, especially when one party is unaware that the resident Cat Person gets aroused when someone strokes their tail. It can also be used in some cases of Boldly Coming where the attractive alien doesn't have comparable human-like genitalia, but does have a type of erogenous zone on them, allowing for a type of human/alien coupling nonetheless.\nFor obvious reasons, this leads to a lot of Power Perversion Potential when said characters show up in fanfic, and if a character does not possess any known Fantastic Arousal the fans may create one.\nCompare and contrast Something Else Also Rises, where this is more of an innuendo for the, er, traditional forms of arousal.\nContrast Strangely Arousing, where the inexplicable incident leads to arousal on the observer's part, though there could be some overlap if the aroused believes that ordinary humans have similar erogenous zones to them. Not to be confused with a character having a strange sexual fetish.\n"}
{"DamselScrappy": "The Damsel in Distress is an age-old classic plot device, which places a character in danger to add tension to the story. Sometimes one character (usually a Love Interest or a relative of another character) seems to have no discernible purpose besides serving as the Designated Victim. If the character is popular with the audience, this can be effective. Other times, well... let's just say that the audience starts wishing that the Big Damn Heroes would get stuck in traffic, just so they won't have to put up with her anymore.\nThe Damsel Scrappy is a combination of the Damsel in Distress (or rarely, the Distressed Dude) with The Scrappy. The result is a character than the fans dislike because she's perceived to be The Load or even The Millstone of the group, not pulling her weight compared to the importance the story gives her as a plot device. Most of the time, this character's plight is due entirely to her own stupidity. She doesn't just pick up the Distress Ball, she runs it into her own endzone and gets tackled for a safety. And she keeps on doing it, again and again and again. This may be due to being The Ditz, or a severe case of crippling Genre Blindness.\nEven if she's just unlucky, she may be disliked for other reasons. Perhaps the audience finds her too bland, or too bitchy. Perhaps her presence seems shoehorned into the main plot (perhaps to attract a Periphery Demographic or for blatant Fanservice), and the audience feels she steals time from the story they're actually interested in. This is especially true when her subplot has nothing to do with the main plot at all. Or else she seems like useless dead weight whose only purpose is to pad the plot by getting in trouble. And worst of all, the fans may just dislike her for getting in the way of their Fan-Preferred Couple, and actually use this trope as an excuse to hate her without being called out for it.\nFaux Action Girl is what you get when you mix this with an Action Girl. Chickification is what happens if an actual Action Girl gets retooled or derailed into this. Child characters can fall prey to this just as easily, especially the Tagalong Kid or a hero's Oblivious Younger Sibling. Large risk of being Trapped by Mountain Lions.\nSee also Too Dumb to Live. Compare The Scrappy and The Load. Compare Defiant Captive and Damsel out of Distress. See also Reckless Sidekick, Sympathetic Sue. Deliberately Distressed Damsel can justify or subvert this trope.\n"}
{"PuppetMaster": "If you were looking for the trope about people who control puppets, look here.\nFor people who control other people, see here.\nFor the sci-fi novel by Robert A. Heinlein, look here.\nAnd for the trope formerly known as the novel, look here.\nAn author/perpetrator of an Alternate Reality Game is called a puppetmaster. In most cases, many puppetmasters are involved in a game, because there is a good bit of work to be done, widely divergent work. Such tasks include burying clue boxes on a GPS coordinate, having cryptic cards printed and distributed, or playing an in-game character for a recorded message.\nThe most widely known Alternate Reality Games are the A.I. tie-in \"The Beast\" and the Halo tie-in \"I Love Bees.\" It is not a coincidence that the owner of record for almost all of the Web sites in \"The Beast\" had the surname \"Gheppetto\". (Further, both The Beast and I Love Bees were produced by the same team: 4orty2wo.)\nLastly, Puppet Master was a cult horror film from Full Moon Pictures which spawned nine sequels of varying quality.\n"}
{"AlternateCharacterReading": "The pronunciation of most Japanese words is not easily gleaned from how they are written. In the Japanese Writing System, words written in kanji often have multiple pronunciations depending on context. Basically, there are two main reading styles for Chinese characters in Japanese, kun-yomi and on-yomi, both of which can lead to a lot of word play (as in the page's example):\nTo help with all this confusion, phonetic glosses called furigana are often provided in smaller characters next to the kanji. This invariably happens for names (whose pronunciations are notoriously idiosyncratic\u2014see nanori) and terms with infrequently-used kanji. Publications for younger readers will often gloss common words as well.\nSometimes, the gloss will show a non-standard reading or another kanji, usually to clarify or highlight a particular nuance the author wishes to convey. This is known as gikun (\u7fa9\u8a13), and is differentiated from jukujikun by being a stylistic choice instead of a systematic property. This technique dates back to the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b and Kojiki, and was very common among Edo period writers (mixing and matching Chinese words to Japanese glosses) and Meiji writers (mixing and matching Sino-Japanese words to recently borrowed Western glosses). A few common examples:\nThe subtle nuances that can be achieved with the use of an alternate reading are almost always Lost in Translation and will at worst end up being unfunny because detailed explanation is compulsory. On the flip side, alternate readings are frequently used when adapting something from English to Japanese in order to retain English names or puns.\nOne note is that kanji characters, having Chinese roots, also have Chinese pronunciations, and one can go from there to other derived regional readings. These readings are rarely used for word plays.\nA somewhat related though fundamentally different wordplay is ateji (\u5f53\u3066\u5b57), where a word is phonetically transcribed into a series of kanji characters. For example, the kanji written form of sushi, \u5bff\u53f8 (su-shi) is an ateji, and literally means something like \"lifespan-administrator\". The characters' meanings will be disregarded most of the time, though semantics will sometimes be considered (and often for stylistic reasons).\nRough equivalents in English would be It Is Pronounced \"Tro-PAY\", Steven Ulysses Perhero, and Louis Cypher, and this can lead to similar humor (Double Entendre, Heh Heh, You Said \"X\", Uranus Is Showing...), Foreshadowing and drama.\nNot to be confused with Alternative Character Interpretation. See Goroawase Number for creative Japanese interpretation of numerals.\n"}
{"PureMagicBeing": "A Pure Magic Being is magic incarnate. Such beings have extraordinarily strong magical powers, sometimes approaching godlike levels. For Pure Magic Beings, magical energy is frequently indistinguishable from Life Energy, so that running out of magic power means death, or fading out of existence. Things that consume or drain magic can be very dangerous to Pure Magic Beings.\nAlthough reminiscent of Energy Beings, Pure Magic Beings usually have physical forms, though those forms are sometimes rather mutable.\nSee also: Cast from Hit Points, Pure Energy. May overlap with Our Phlebotinum Child.\n"}
{"ChristmasEveryDay": "A character or group of characters experiences \"Christmas Every Day,\" sometimes as a \"Groundhog Day\" Loop or as Christmas literally occurring every day. Sometimes a Whole Plot Reference to the short story \"Christmas Every Day\" by William Dean Howells.\nThe reason for the repeats varies \u2014 a character who really loves Christmas might wish that that every day is Christmas Day, and it somehow comes true. In these cases, the entire cast might feel the holiday repeating. Alternatively, a \"Groundhog Day\" Loop resets to teach a character a lesson, often the True Meaning of Christmas or An Aesop about valuing friends and family during the holiday season. This variation will usually have only the protagonist (who, by contrast, dislikes Christmas) be aware of the resets. Either plot will also center around trying to find a way to break the loop.\nSister trope to \"Gift of the Magi\" Plot, How the Character Stole Christmas, It's a Wonderful Plot, and Yet Another Christmas Carol, other common Christmas-themed Whole Plot References. May be a series' Christmas Episode or a stand-alone Christmas Special.\n"}
{"Jossed": "A fan gets Jossed when the elaborate Epileptic Trees or Fanfic that they've lovingly built upon canonical elements is abruptly disproved by further canon or Word of God. Named after Joss Whedon; Buffy the Vampire Slayer was notorious for this. Fans would come up with detailed and elaborate theories or plots during summer hiatuses, most of which got completely thrown out within three episodes of the new season.\nMay lead to Fanon Discontinuity when disgruntled fans prefer their own fanon over the canon. In extreme cases, critics and fans may invoke Death of the Author to preserve their interpretation of events.\nNote that in some circles, the term \"Jossed\" refers to a gutwrenching main character death, which Whedon is also famous for. This definition entered the populace when during a Q&A session at an Australian university, a young Aussie girl noted his tendency to do horrible things to on-screen couples, and to much laughter, said \"We call it getting 'Jossed'\". Other sources also use this term as \"shocking plot twist.\" This trope deals only with the \"classic\" definition.\nThis has two opposites: I Knew It!, where the fan theory is proven to be true by a twist that was planned all along, and Ascended Fanon, where the author decides to promote some fanon elements to canon status. The inverse of this is Shrug of God, where the author refuses to say that one answer is more \"correct\" than another.\nFor specific cases of fan works being disproven and not simple guesses, see Outdated by Canon.\n"}
{"PlotTechnology": "High technology (or magic) available to characters never seems to trickle down to the populace. In particular, if a villain is in possession of a weapon which would be worth millions to the Pentagon, why would he limit himself to robbing banks with it? This especially applies to one-shot enemies on Speculative Fiction series with amazing inventions that have never been seen before \u2014 and are never seen again, unless that villain recurs. One suspect is the short half-life of the necessary Plotonium-186 required to power this type of technology.\nSee also No Plans, No Prototype, No Backup, Cut Lex Luthor a Check, Reed Richards Is Useless.\n"}
{"TalkingPoo": "... But what if they could?\nSentient feces. Living dung. Intelligent droppings. Basically, poo that's alive. Doesn't necessarily have to speak, as long as it's sentient. Anthropomorphised doodoo is generally for comedic purposes, but there are exceptions.\nA subtrope of Toilet Humor and Animate Inanimate Object.\n"}
{"WanderingTheEarth": "Footloose and fancy-free, we set off among the Adventure Towns, seeking the next place, rather than our fortunes.\nThis trope is bottomless, it seems. The audience wants to believe life without roots is romantic and full of adventure. The character has no home (or they are in the process of finding one), no job, no money, no identification, no friends, and no visible means of support, yet is always healthy, well-fed, clean, and welcome wherever he goes.\nMost of us would agree with Vincent Vega's response to Jules' quote above: \"You're gonna become a bum! If you don't have a job, a home, and legal tender, that's all you'll be is a bum. Someone who picks in garbage cans and eats the stuff I throw away.\" Most people who go walking the earth by themselves are male (or disguised as male). Females generally belong to a nomadic group, mostly for defense purposes.\nIt's much easier when you have a valuable skill... but this is a different trope. You can get away with just walking the earth in settings with sufficiently strong traditions of Sacred Hospitality, though \u2014 like Homeric Greece (obviously), the Muslim world (where hospitality is a religious obligation), the Balkans if you're not from next door, and the American South or Old West. Some Walkers, however, have some skills like craftsmanship that they utilize to make a trade/earn a living while traveling, like hobos. Some occupations such as cobbler and tinker are traditionally nomadic because you would use up your customer base in a location and have to move on to the next only to circle back when your first customers had worn out their shoes or pots. The music business also sees a lot of these; touring musicians get at least a taste of this life, and those who want more work can always find it outside of their bands as fill-in musicians, tour managers, techs, and other \"road jobs\".\nThis trope is a very American one and is quite common in older Westerns. As far as big TV producing nations go, The U.S. of A. has the geography best suited to this form of adventure. Australia also has the tradition of the Walkabout, where young men would wander the land for months as a spiritual journey. However, this occurs in other countries as well, such as the ronin stories of Japan and the Chivalric Cycles of Europe and the U.K.\nWhen one is forced to walk the earth against one's will, this trope becomes the much darker Flying Dutchman.\nIf a character walking the earth has a strict code of honor and spreads justice in his wake, he's a Knight Errant. Same code of honor (and wanderlust) usually results in passing the \"Leave Your Quest\" Test.\nMost Wuxia heroes fall under either Knight Errant or (if they do not have a code of honour but merely wanders the land for enjoyment) this, they will master their arts and search for worthy opponents, either before a remarkable quest calls for them or after they already finished their quest in life and decides to drift off to other places.\nSubtrope of In Harm's Way.

{"Isekai": "A standard plot/Myth Arc for Speculative Fiction: The Ordinary High-School Student, frequently his friends, and sometimes his enemies are all transported (often summoned) to another world \u2014 distant planet, a Magical Land, Alternate Universe, the past, The Future \u2014 where they find they have an important role to play in Events of Significance that are occurring at the same time as (or sometimes because of) their arrival. Usually there is no hope of their finding a means to return home until after the great threat facing them has been defeated. Occasionally, they will then question if they even want to leave, especially when there is an ongoing Fantastic Romance.\nIn Light Novels this is known as the \"Isekai\"note\u00a0Literally \"Another World\" genre, with such characters typically being a Stock Light-Novel Hero, where it usually involves said character gaining RPG-like powers on arrival (or at the very least, is set in a Role-Playing Game Verse). These stories often feature alternate methods of bringing the protagonist to the new world, such as Reincarnation, swapping bodies with an inhabitant of the new world, or becoming their own MMORPG avatar, though simple bodily transport is still common. The majority of isekai are also Harem Series, to the extent that a party of sexy heroines who are attracted to the protagonist has become part of the standard formula. Recently, these types of stories have become popular thanks to Japanese publishing companies like Alphapolis and Media Factory. This has since become an Undead Horse Trope on the Light Novel market, being parodied, subverted and even sometimes ridiculed to hell and back, but is still a very much present genre.\nIn Literature this is often referred to as a \"Portal Fantasy\". This plot device is extremely popular in Crossover Fanfiction.\nIf it's the hero's job to bring back a trapped person, it can become an Orphean Rescue; while if someone else turns up to bring back the hero, it's Weirdness Search and Rescue.\nSuper Trope to Portal Book, Portal Picture, Summon Everyman Hero, and Trapped in TV Land. Often overlaps with Down the Rabbit Hole, Fish out of Water, and You Can't Go Home Again. (When returning home proves to be relentlessly mundane and you wish you'd stayed in the magic world, it's So What Do We Do Now?.) The inverse of Alien Among Us.\nCompare with Kidnapped by the Call. Compare and constrast with Constructed World and Xenofiction, which feature other worlds that don't involve present-day Earth at all. For generic types of other dimensions, see Another Dimension. See also The Homeward Journey. For the reincarnation flavor of this plot, see Reincarnate In Another World.\n"}
{"UnSorcerer": "A Muggle Born of Mages is someone privy to The Masquerade, born to parents with Magic and Powers, but entirely mundane himself. He ought to be just as powerful, but he isn't. No fear, though: the world is full of Muggles and no one comments. He can simply become one of them.\nIn other words, he's way better off than the Un-Sorcerer.\nIn the Un-Sorcerer's world, there is no Masquerade, because Everyone is a Super...except him. Magic healing doesn't help, and neither does therapy. The kids at school tease him. He can't operate Magitek. He can't even claim to be a Badass Normal, because normal people have the Power! This lack makes him, for practical intents and purposes, disabled, in a world that has no way of accommodating him.\nAs bad as this sounds, though, there's a silver lining: someday, it will turn out that his unique status is an asset to him. He may be immune to magical attacks, or to The Corruption. Maybe he really has a game-breakingly awesome power that takes a long time to manifest. Maybe there's an Ancient Artifact that only activates for someone with no magic. Or perhaps, lacking a crutch, the Un-Sorcerer develops a Charles Atlas Superpower in a world of Squishy Wizards. What's certain is that the Un-Sorcerer will go far, and may even be The Chosen One.\nAn Un-Sorcerer can only survive by averting Hard Work Hardly Works. Essentially an in Inversion of the classic Super Hero trope. See also Muggles Do It Better. Sometimes used to derive An Aesop.\n"}
{"MultipleGovernmentPolity": "Most modern western audiences, especially in the United States of America, are used to modern local/sub-national governments acting like miniaturized versions of their national government. But historically that wasn't always the case and some fiction reflects that.\nThe Federation might form from an alliance of kingdoms and republics, or The Empire might allow subjugated governments to run their territories for them.\nThis kind of polity tends to be prone to Allowed Internal War, though.\n"}
{"ClothesMaketheSuperman": "The Phlebotinum is applied to a character's clothes instead of himself.\nHaving superpowers built into a magical or technological garment instead of inherent to a character is a common element of Super Hero stories and other speculative fiction. It allows an otherwise fragile muggle whose only outstanding skill may be smarts to play with the big dogs. It allows a mundane hero, closer to the common man than a mutant, alien, or cyborg. It provides a hero with a creamy center that bad guys can exploit, and provides a plausible reason for the Secret Identity to be vulnerable. Normally, technological super suits surround the character completely, covering 100% of his skin, and are hermetically sealed. In this way, the suit is doing all the work, and the operator is simply pushing its actions from within.\nThe most straightforward version of the super suit is Powered Armor, the logical extreme of Mini-Mecha. These use some form of mechanical system, like artificial muscles, electric motors, or hydraulics to drive their actions. They may be controlled by positive feedback, responding to the operator's body movements to keep the pressure in the suit balanced, or they may use a mind interface, either wireless or cybernetically implanted. These suits are hard, armored and inflexible, making them hard to wear under civvies or pack for trips. These are the most likely to be mass-produced in a Sci Fi setting, as a souped-up space suit, hostile environment gear, or infantry body armor.\nMoving out from there, we find the \"soft\" super suit, based on some form of \"smart materials\", nanotechnology, magic, or even living tissue. These can often morph or reassemble themselves, and can be folded, stored and perhaps even machine washed.\nSingle articles of clothing that add powers are also common. Typically, they empower the part of the body on which they are worn, but they can also have peripheral effects; gauntlets of super strength usually also reinforce the legs and back, for instance. These are almost always magic, and can often be mixed and matched.\nWhen headwear has this effect, it's a Hat of Power. For jewelry, see Magical Accessory. Can sometimes be a form of Upgrade Artifact. No matter the type, if it's worn by a woman, expect Stripperifficness. If metal is part of it, then expect Elemental Crafting. If jewels are a part of it, then expect Power Crystals. If the clothes cannot be removed, it's a Clingy Costume. Contrast Frilly Upgrade. For suits that work with powers but do not provide them, see My Suit Is Also Super. In general these are a case of an Amulet of Concentrated Awesome for obvious reasons. A very mild video-game example would be Stat Sticks. When the powers of these clothes matter more than what they look like, you can get Rainbow Pimp Gear or an Embarrassing but Empowering Outfit.\nNot to be confused with Clothes Make the Legend. Clothes Make the Maniac is where this trope applies, but the costume also drives the wearer evil.\n"}
{"EscapistCharacter": "So you just picked up this book about a character who's powerful, incredibly talented, irresistible to the opposite sex, long-lost royalty, and Friend to All Living Things. Sounds like a horrible Mary Sue story, right?\nExcept that you don't mind at all. Instead, you're seeing yourself in their shoes and enjoying it. After all, everyone likes to fantasize about being awesome once in a while. You can argue over whether or not they're a Mary Sue, but they're definitely an Escapist Character.\nWhile Mary Sue is generally defined as being a bad thing, some of the most widely loved characters in existence are Escapist Characters with any number of Common Mary Sue Traits. While a badly written Escapist Character can come off as a Mary Sue, the key difference between the two is that while a Mary Sue is the author's wish fulfillment fantasy, the Escapist Character functions as the audience's wish fulfillment fantasy.\nSome members of the audience may identify with a character and others may not identify with the same character. Whilst many audience member's Wish Fulfillment fantasies have common elements, they are not all identical. Thus, the distinction between this and Mary Sue is very much a subjective matter.\nPlease remember that conceptually, neither Wish Fulfillment nor Escapism are bad. Compare the Showy Invincible Hero. See also: I Just Want to Be Normal, I Just Want to Have Friends, I Just Want to Be Special, I Just Want to Be Badass; wishes that are fulfilled by escapist characters.\nCompare/Contrast the Expectation Lowerer, a character that allows you to feel awesome by being much worse than you are; and This Loser Is You; a character who the creator feels is a representative of the audience. This trope has nothing to do with the Escapist film or website.\n"}
{"DroneDeployer": "An alternative to magically summoning beings for your use, you can instead carry them on your person to deploy and recall them as needed. This is common in science fiction with vehicles or robots, though some magical examples or even natural examples such as some real life mutualism.\nMethods of storage are:\nThe roles these drones can play for the deployer are:\nDrones are often Transforming Mecha or Size Shifters to help conserve space and store more of them.

{"LittleDidIKnow": "Uttered by the main character/Narrator to the audience, to indicate that a major plot is about to happen.\n\"I was just an Ordinary High-School Student, that normal, peaceful day. Little Did I Know that this was all going to change.\" or \"I thought it was over. Little Did I Know, it had only just begun.\"\nThis line probably originated in 19th Century English romance/gothic novels. The heroine innocently takes a \"position\" or visits some place where evil lurks or adventure looms behind a calm, civilized veneer. She begins the narrative of the novel, with classic British understatement, something like this: \"If I had but known that I would soon be facing a madman with an axe in those dank catacombs, I would never have had the courage to get on the train to Sussex that fatal day last summer . . .\"\nRelated to How We Got Here if it gives away unlikely-sounding details of the plot ahead of time. Found only in first-person narration and omniscient narration with a chatty narrator. Since it's basically a way to invoke Foreshadowing without any actual, you know, foreshadowing, it's a Discredited Trope.\n Comic Strips\n Literature\n Video Games\n Western Animation\n"}
{"RareMaleExample": "An Always Female, or Always Male, trope that is applied to the opposite gender.\nWhile it's not possible to pull off with many of these tropes, due to some of them requiring certain biological features, and others are automatically seen in a different light when gender-inverted, (like the Mama Bear and the Papa Wolf, or the Action Girl and the Action Hero), making them an entirely different trope, others are only based on certain generic concepts associated with the gender, and nothing stops the writers from playing with them.\nIt might be Played for Drama, Played for Laughs as a character's unique quirk, or even not intended at all: For example, maybe a writer simply thought that gypsy men are hot, and didn't even realize that Hot Gypsy Woman is a lot more common trope.\nConversely, it can be our own fault, due to Values Dissonance, as our trope definitions are largely based on Western and Japanese works, so it is possible that for example an Indian or Latin American show's characters can be only described with our vocabulary as \"Like this trope, but male\", even though it could be considered a different trope over there, but none of us knows enough about the culture to make a page for it.\nIn trope lists, it is often referred to as Rare Male Example and Rare Female Example.\nCompare Distaff Counterpart, Unisex Tropes.\n"}

{"TreasureHuntEpisode": "This is an episode in a show structured around looking for treasure, when the show isn't normally about that. Usually this involves one of the main characters reading about a famous treasure buried in their town, and setting out to look for it with the rest of the cast. Usually, the main villains also set out to look for it, and either steal it (in which case the treasure will turn out to be worthless), or fail to get it before the heroes. Often will involve the cast parodying pirates. In children's shows, the treasure is almost never actual treasure, usually being something like candy.\nSub-trope of Treasure Map.\nCompare Never Win the Lottery.\nNot to be confused with an episode of Treasure Hunt UK or Treasure Hunt US.\n"}
{"ShoujoDemographic": "The demographic category of anime and manga aimed mainly at teenage girls. It tends to have female leads, romantic subplots and resolutions involving personal growth. This doesn't mean Sh\u014djo is devoid of action, though. In addition to more traditional romance stories, Sh\u014djo can include tales of heroines who kick righteous butt \u2014 while pursuing romantic subplots and personal growth.\nAlternately, Sh\u014djo stories can focus on implied or explicit homosexual relationships between men (see Boys' Love for the genre, Yaoi Guys for characters outside of the genre), or the romantic emphasis could also stem from relationships between women. Some feature all of the above, and usually feature a Relationship Ceiling.\nAlthough series with explicit sexuality are more likely to be Josei (aimed at older women), some Sh\u014djo may have considerable sexual content; a subgenre called Teens Love (by analogy to Boys Love) features erotic romance between heterosexual couples, with much the same narrative conventions (abusive boyfriends and angst; or, alternately, shiny romance, ecstatic lovemaking, and Happily Ever After). This stuff tends to snuggle up as close to the \"Restricted\" (18+) category as it can, and so isn't often licensed for translation.\nNot all romance series are Sh\u014djo. Sh\u014dnen romances take the boy's perspective (Magical Girlfriends and Harem Series are both common, though there are just as many mundane one-to-one stories), and focus on the boy pursuing the girl, or trying to resolve the Love Dodecahedron. If it doesn't have that, a Sh\u014dnen romance tends to end with a declaration of love and its acceptance. Female-led Sh\u014dnen romance also has this dynamic (occasionally gender-inverted), though some begin with the pair together before the start while we see snippets of their relationship. Sh\u014djo romances, by contrast, frequently involve the heroine finding love early in the series, then stick around to watch the couple work through trouble in their relationship. Sh\u014djo romances with male leads often tread somewhere in between: sometimes it takes the Sh\u014dnen route of the chase, others focus on how the boy treats his newfound lover.\nConversely, not all Sh\u014djo series are romance either; some may just focus on dealing with everyday issues, others with uncovering mysteries, others where the action gets graphic or cerebral, and still others that like to take the scenic route of life. And there's been times where Sh\u014djo can get as bold-faced and crass as any Sh\u014dnen manga, as any reader of Patalliro! or Sabagebu! can tell you.\nAesthetically, Sh\u014djo is typically drawn with lighter outlines than Sh\u014dnen manga, and with sparser backgrounds and little (if any) shading \u2014 but, contrariwise, it frequently uses screentone patterns to set the emotional tone of a scene, and frames are rarely solely rectangular and borders are often absent. Character designs with eyes that are even larger than those usually used in manga and anime (the infamous dinner plate size) are also usually a giveaway that the work in question is Sh\u014djo \u2014 especially when the characters are not children. Though even that rule may not be ironclad: thanks to the Periphery Demographic of girls reading Sh\u014dnen manga, the bolder lines and smaller eyes common to works of that demographic can find their way back into Sh\u014djo to draw a wider appeal.\nSh\u014djo is a demographic (usually identified by the time slot or magazine a story runs in) and shows so classified can fit into any \"standard\" genre, up to and including martial arts and Science Fiction. And even this is variable; popular female leads sometimes gain a male fan following, to the degree of the infamous older male fanbase. Anything Magical Girl is usually Sh\u014djo by default, although there are exceptions, specifically made for said older fanbase.\nWhile a lot of this demographic's manga output does get adapted into anime of varying popularity, its real foothold is in a medium even its brother demographic had a hard time attracting viewers: Live-Action TV. As their romance and contemporary series tend to match up with common trends in tv serials, Sh\u014djo and Josei manga adaptations tend to make up a sizeable portion of Japanese Doramas. In fact, it may find more popularity through its Dorama version than its life as a manga.\nShould not be confused with Bishoujo, though some may feature as characters. Or Lord Shojo. Serves as both the Trope Namer and Trope Codifier for Stock Shoujo Heroine.\n"}
{"AnimeChineseGirl": "A cute Chinese girl, usually with a variable accent. Nearly guaranteed to dress at some point in a qipao (or, almost as often, a tangzhuang) and has Odango Hair. A very high proportion (even for anime) will know martial arts, always in a Chinese style. Most of them will be called Lanhua (more often spelled Ranpha in merchandise), Meiling (sometimes Mei Lin), or some other popular name, even though there are many options for Chinese names.\nIn Anime and Manga the Chinese are a special case to the usual But Not Too Foreign treatment of foreigners, due to the long-running rivalry (historically exploding into outright war more than once) between China and Japan. Hong Kong is in a weird place in the middle (culturally, if not geographically), usually used when the writers want to set a story in a Vice City that wouldn't work properly otherwise.\nEvil Chinese girls grow up to be Dragon Ladies. Or they might have a change of heart after years of helping their evil mad scientist fathers.\nA subtrope of Stereotypes of Chinese People.\n"}
{"EverythingISBetterWithPrincesses": "You've turned on the latest kids' TV program, and look, there's a girl in a pink, floofy dress with a wand \u2014 and she's got a tiara and sometimes a pretty cape trimmed with ermine. Whether she's The Cutie, an Action Girl, a Magical Girl, The Leader of La R\u00e9sistance, or whatever you can think of, there's one very strong possibility: she's royalty; specifically, a princess.\nAfter years of exposure to the classical princess we have this interpretation that princesses have it easy. They don't have to work (that's their parents' job!), they get everything they want (money and power go a long way) and, in girls' series, they have very marketable wardrobes (blame the Ermine Cape Effect). Being a \"princess\" may not even affect the plot in any meaningful way, and the audience may get the sense that princessdom is just a quick way to give a female character a sense of specialness, with no pesky obligations to a family or kingdom that might get in the way of having adventures.\nUsually, if she's got powers, she's The Chosen One, and it's all because of her lineage. Her sheltered life has left her ill-prepared to cope with real adversity. This is usually true even if she grew up in a commoner family to hide from her enemies \u2014 perhaps frailty is in the blood.\nShe'll likely be the White Magician Girl to showcase her gentleness and purity, while also keeping her away from the front lines and unsightly bruises. On the other hand, if she's surprisingly good in a fight despite her sheltered upbringing, it might be because Authority Equals Asskicking. Her weapon of choice will likely be a Regal Rapier.\nAny kingdom worth the name has a princess. If that's the case, expect a violent conflict with her Aloof Big Brother, The Evil Prince, and/or the Evil Chancellor. She will likely have a personal knight to assist her in such conflicts, be her Love Interest, etc.\nBy the way, do not expect princes to be given anything like the same sympathy as their sisters (more so in modern works). They are very often either outright bad or well meaning but stupid. The exception is The Wise Prince, who is likely to have more royal duties because of certain historical perspectives. If this princess has sisters, odds are good to see The Glorious War of Sisterly Rivalry.\nNote that you rarely see any minor nobles as lead female characters, nor any young queens. If she's a royal, she's the princess. Her sketchy genetic makeup will be avoided altogether, and you won't see a single Habsburg chin around. Though in real life, princesses can be any age, princesses in fiction are usually children or teenagers, and are almost never older than 25, let alone middle-aged or elderly. The perfect age for an Arranged Marriage plot to kick in!\nOftentimes, she is the 100% ruler of a region. This is sometimes justified by the region in question being a principality rather than a kingdom.\nIt is something of a Dead Horse Trope due to literally centuries of overuse, and having become firmly recognised as a Common Mary Sue Trait. Despite this, due to the Grandfather Clause, teenage girls, and how easy it is to parody, plenty of princesses will appear in the pages yet to come.\nThis is also why many tropes have \"princess\" in the name, even though a princess isn't required (just a common example).\nA Super Trope to:\nCompare Daddy's Little Villain (who can often be a princess)\nSee also Prince Charming, Knight in Shining Armor, The High Queen\n"}
{"HairyHammerspace": "This is an old gag. It's where someone seems to have a storage space set in his hair. Usually, that hairstyle is an afro, but not always. Why is he capable of doing this? Because he has Hammerspace Hair!\nA minor variation is when a character keeps things stored in his beard. Can also be invoked if a character's entire body is covered with hair.\nSubtrope of Hammerspace.\nFor times when it seems like someone's hair must have been hidden in hammerspace, see Compressed Hair. This is actually a real technique some people employ in street fights, so employing this tactic can make one a Combat Pragmatist.\n"}
{"LadyLegionnaireWear": "Segmented skirts (either skirts which consist of four or more overlapping \"petal\" strips, or actual plates of armour, which come down from the waistband) are often used as a way to make a suit of armour more feminine by adding in an armoured skirt, or, conversely, to mark out one of a group of fabric skirt wearers as tougher than the rest, without breaking the theme by giving her trousers. The correct name for the segments are pteruges.\nThe reason for this trope is a short dress is a popular choice of outfit for an Action Girl, however, it is rather impractical and might look a bit too feminine for some characters. This trope is often used as a compromise, as it resembles, or often actually is, armour and thus it looks less feminine than a typical dress. An added bonus is that it looks more practical, since the segments won't restrict the wearer's movements.\nThis trope is also more likely to be combined with Skirt over Slacks or Modesty Shorts compared to other dress related tropes, either to re-enforce the idea that it's part of a suit of armour or for modesty.\nA Sister Trope to Battle Ballgown, Minidress of Power.\nCompare Showgirl Skirt, Pimped-Out Dress, Man in a Kilt, Pretty Princess Powerhouse.\nContrast Chainmail Bikini (although this skirt can be paired with otherwise skimpy armor).\n"}
{"SwissArmySuperpower": "Sometimes a power seems limited. While talking to fish, super speed, and superhuman parkour skills are most definitely special abilities that could prove formidable in certain, very specific situations, much of the time they appear to be near-useless novelties.\nOr so it would seem to those who lack imagination. See, characters with Swiss Army Super Powers are able to apply their narrowly-defined abilities in an amazing array of situations. Solely because their insight is so great, the Swiss Army Super Powered are always expanding the potential utility of their powers.\nWhat sets the Swiss Army Power apart from similar power tropes is that the defined base ability never changes. The user simply becomes aware of aspects to their power they didn't think of before. The base rules do not change.\nThis blend of flexibility and limitation is convenient for the writers, because it allows them to get their heroes in and out of a host of sticky situations while avoiding complaints from fans that they've pulled a new power out of a character's ass. It still has a semblance of consistency. However, this also depends on how creative a writer can be about it.\nOften confused with Combo Platter Powers where a character is simply given multiple unrelated powers rather than using variations on a theme (like Superman's Flight AND Laser Eyes, or Emma Frost's telepathy AND diamond form.)\nReality Warper, by definition, is a Swiss Army Superpower. Elemental Powers, especially electric ones, are often treated this way as is Biomanipulation, but even seemingly simple abilities like Super Speed can be given a large number of applications. This is very common when Required Secondary Powers are acknowledged in-universe. In some cases, they can even eclipse the primary ability in usefulness.\nNamed after Swiss Army Knives, which are pocket sized sets of 8 - 10 undersized tools that can do everything.\nExpect Forgot About His Powers to occur on multiple occasions.\nCompare Green Rocks (which do this stuff at the whim of the writers, rather than serving a specific character), New Powers as the Plot Demands (for cases where new powers are the result of Ass Pull), Repower (for situations when a character has their powerset either expanded upon in a \"nonlinear\" way, or reimagined entirely from the ground up), Adaptive Ability, Swiss Army Weapon and Adaptive Armor. When a weak-sounding power has this, then it's Heart Is an Awesome Power. Semantic Superpower and Imagination-Based Superpower are also related.\n"}
{"TheSmartOne": "This is the guy in the Five-Man Band whose focus is on intellectual pursuits. This is The Team member who will always be prepared, sometimes Crazy-Prepared. The Smart Guys will be at the computer doing Rapid-Fire Typing. Expect some fancy talk and Techno Babble from these characters. Because their role is about ideas they initially leave the action stuff to the others. Of course, Weak, but Skilled is always in effect for these guys.\nPhysically if not tall and skinny, the Smart Guys are usually short and wear glasses. They may even be a Child Prodigy. The Smart Guy is sometimes written as mousey and withdrawn. If not antisocial, at least non-social, sliding into TV Genius. Can be expected to play a mean game of chess.\nSometimes the Smart Guys are more street savvy than they appear. If this is the case it usually makes The Smart Guy physically as well as mentally capable. This is the path of the Badass Bookworms, or those who Minored In Ass Kicking. They remain firmly planted as the Smart Guy, but are just as ready to fight as everyone else. The results are often impressive, and usually have the advantage of surprise. Who expects the little guy with glasses to be an asskicker?\nWith a personality range from the introverted and weird TV Genius, the highly technical Spock, to the improbably cool Hollywood Nerd, the smart guy is better defined by the skills he brings to the table rather how he acts. Common types that you can mix and match on your way to Omnidisciplinary Scientist are:\nOther common powers include:\nIn terms of relationships, The Smart Guy may be part of a Little Guy, Big Buddy duo with The Big Guy, or a less volatile foil pair than The Hero and The Lancer. Alternatively the smart guy can act as a loyal sidekick under The Leader, to contrast with The Lancer whose force of personality and vocal dissent is more of a partner on equal footing.\nAs casts have become more gender-balanced, The Smart Girl is the one most likely to swap genders. Since the character type is not stereotypically masculine, turning them into The Smart Girl is not a big stretch. During The New '10s, the prevalence of media partnerships with STEM also encouraged many a Smart Girl especially for the Gadgeteer Genius archetype. When used in this way, she's usually much less girly than The Chick.\nIn an ensemble, the Smart Guy is usually the last character to have a Love Interest if they even bother to give him one at all. When they do, expect a subplot about the geek's unrequited feelings towards an unattainable cooler love interest for Smart Guys around the same age as the rest of the cast. Younger Smart Guys may have a cute Puppy Love plot with someone their own age, or a Precocious Crush on someone much older. In most cases where the geek's love interest is not \"out of their league\", they tend to be little more than a Distaff Counterpart.\nIf there's a Robot Buddy on the team, he's usually The Smart Guy.\nIf the Smart Guy happens to be big and strong, he has enough of The Big Guy elements to be a Genius Bruiser. Otherwise, he's a Badass Bookworm.\nIf you're looking for his Evil Counterpart, it's typically The Evil Genius.\nOh, and he's also part of the Four-Man Band in a comedy ensemble.\nNot to be confused with the series Smart Guy.\n"}
{"SquareRaceRoundClass": "A character in an otherwise typical fantasy game/story whose profession seems at odds with their nature or appearance as assumed by tradition or the audience, like a dwarven ranger or an ogre engineer. Sometimes this is for sheer game balance and variety, while other times it's lampshaded as being appropriate if seen in the right light. After all, even if Hobbits don't make the best warriors, that doesn't mean Hobbit warriors don't exist. Somebody's gotta protect the Hobbit village, right? Likewise, with the forests you find above and around the Dwarves' mountain halls, it makes sense to have a few guys who know their way around them.\nOccasionally this is the reason the Plucky Comic Relief seems so inept; it's just misplaced interest in something inappropriate for them.\nCompare Stereotype Flip. May stem from Klingon Scientists Get No Respect.\n"}
{"SportsHeroBackstory": "When it comes time to invent a character's backstory, it seems sometimes the writers can't help but inject a bit of sports heroism. It's not enough to simply have them be a typical scrub player on a high school team (which still generally requires above-average athleticism); they'll have been the star player, or have played on the team that was in contention for the national championship. If it was a football team, they'll probably have been the quarterback. If it was a basketball team, they'll probably have been the high-scoring team captain. There may even have been talk of them going pro, often cut short by a career-ending injury.\nSuch a sports-hero backstory may in turn be used to justify the character having specific skills, or superior athleticism generally, which may result in I Know Madden Kombat. This can also lend a bit of pathos to a character who could have been a contender. This may lead to a character being Famed In-Story, as well, although it is occasionally a headscratcher because the character's backstory makes them somebody who ought to be more famous in the story than they are generally presented as being. May overlap with Real Award, Fictional Character.\nNote that it's very common for pro wrestlers to have played non-staged sports professionally earlier in the life (football players are especially common in US circles), so examples should be limited to when this is made relevant to their wrestling persona.\nAnime and Manga\nComic Books\nComic Strips\nExpanded Universe\nFan Works\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nProfessional Wrestling\nVideo Games\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"AirHugging": "Male characters show discomfort expressing emotions, particularly affection towards another man. Often results in a \"hug\" with no physical contact, an obviously awkward hug, etc. There's also the version where females can hug with their bodies close but guys hug while their lower halves are far away, so they have to lean over more to hug. This has been referred to as \"A-Frame hugging\".\nSee also: Ho Yay, Real Men Hate Affection, Man Hug\n"}
{"ArtNouveau": "A new style of decorative art that predominated much of the Fin de si\u00e8cle (The Gay '90s and The Edwardian Era), Art Nouveau's style consists of asymmetric and fluid movements, and naturalistic colors and themes. Its style was applied to every field, notably buildings, crafts, paintings, lithographic posters and furniture.\nThe movement has influences from drawings of plant life, works by Alphonse Mucha, Pre-Raphaelite paintings, Oriental flavours, and the Neoclassical, Romantic, Post-impressionist and Expressionist movements. The style spread throughout Europe, where its mode was dubbed in many languages, typically termed as \"new\", \"modern\" or \"young\" art. In Germany and Northern Europe, it was called the \u201cJugendstil\u201d (youth style) or \"secession\". In Catalonia, it was called \"Modernisme,\" and is associated inextricably with the weirdly-skeletal but delightful architecture of Antoni Gaud\u00ed. In Italy, it was called the stile Liberty after the British department store Liberty in London, which apparently supplied a lot of the brightly-coloured fabric Italian artists working in the style liked to use.\nWhatever its name, Art Nouveau fell out of favour during or before World War I. The exuberant, richly ornamented style seemed wrong somehow after so much death and destruction and the growing anxiety of the Machine Age. However, it influenced Art Deco and other modernist movements.\nThis style predominates in much of 1890s-style Steam Punk. Note that art movements before 1890 range from Romantic to Impressionist.\n"}
{"ActuallyAGoodIdea": "Much in the same way that Actually Pretty Funny has to admit the wit in a routine, Actually A Good Idea makes it where someone openly acknowledges that an idea that a person had made is not all that terrible. Said idea is often a simple solution thought outside-the-box from a Na\u00efve Newcomer or a second opinion that definitely knows what they are talking about, an idea to a pressing dilemma that has everybody else pulling there collective hair out.\nSuch ideas are also the kind that are dismissed as dumb or ridiculous half the time, only for the idea to have been executed anyway and reveals that it was actually Crazy Enough to Work.\nCompare Actually Pretty Funny, The Cuckoolander Was Right, Dumbass Has a Point, Jerkass Has a Point, Strawman Has a Point and the rest of This Index Has A Point. Contrast with Are You Sure You Want to Do That? and I Don't Think That's Such a Good Idea.\n"}
{"SturdyAndSteadyTurtles": "One of the most well known attributes of turtles and tortoises is that they're not exceptionally fast and nimble animals. Between their heavy shells and short legs, they're not very well suited for quick, speedy movement, and as such have evolved to be more reliant on their thick armor for protection than in outrunning danger.\nThis is often carried over in fiction, sometimes to the point of exaggeration. Fictional turtles tend to be ridiculously slow, sometimes to the point of seeming to move \u2014 or even speak \u2014 in slow motion.\nThere are two general ways this trope is often employed. Sometimes, the turtles' slowness is equated with patience and endurance in contrast with hurry and impatience, a la The Tortoise and the Hare, with the turtle's plodding but steady progress reliably getting it where it needs to go, even if not in a very flashy way. Other times, it is combined with the turtle's natural and seemingly impenetrable armor to create a Stone Wall or Mighty Glacier-type character, slow and not necessarily very strong, but capable of weathering almost any attack. Together, these two attributes create characters that rely on their trusty defenses to patiently endure the attacks of more hotheaded, brash foes and wait until they give up in boredom or frustration \u2014 something based off of the way turtles defend themselves in real life, retreating into their shells and waiting for would-be predators to give up and leave before coming back out.\nIn real life, turtles may not be the most agile animals around, but they're nowhere near as slow as fiction makes them out to be. Sea turtles can be quite speedy when they need to be, especially in the water. The part about them being well-defended is absolutely Truth in Television, especially for land-dwelling tortoises (but, again, sea turtles are something of an exception \u2014 an overly thick shell would harm their buoyancy, and the leatherback sea turtle does not have a bony shell at all: its back is covered by thick skin alone).\nSee also Turtle Island and Wise Old Turtle.\n"}
{"Wutai": "\n\n\nWutai is the village/country/continent in a Medieval European Fantasy world which has inexplicably (and suspiciously) fashioned itself off Jidai Geki. Filled with youkai, onmyodo, geisha, ninja and/or samurai, this is where katanas, oni, kitsune, pagodas and sushi all pour out into the rest of the world.\nThese places are frequently a mashup of various Japanese eras, maybe flavored with a little bit of China, and \u2014 in a nod to real history \u2014 are usually xenophobic. The background music will be stereotypical Asian instruments, if not a public domain tune.\nThis can perhaps be attributed to the fact that most console RPG publishers are Japanese. However, such a place may not stand out so much if the setting includes other non-European Fantasy Counterpart Cultures. It also tends to be less jarring if the setting covers a large geographical area; for example if it spans an entire planet, a Fantasy Counterpart Culture of Japan or China is no less likely than one of a European culture. Katanas Are Just Better, Everything's Better with Samurai, and Gratuitous Ninja are related phenomena. See also Jidai Geki and Far East.\nNot to be confused with Ji\u0101ngh\u00fa, the fantasy counterpart of China commonly seen in Wuxia.\n"}
{"TheUnnamed": "A major character is never referred to by their actual or full name, instead being addressed by a title, nickname, Only One Name, or none at all. Reasons for this vary, but it often serves the function of making a character seem more mysterious or eccentric.\nIn older (pre-1900 in North America; pre-1970 in the UK) fiction, a narrator may refer to a character (especially an older or more socially prominent character) by his or her surname. This is because at that time first names were much less commonly used socially than they are now; a young character may not even know the first name of an older character he or she is not related to. It was also common in that time to blank out the names of real people to avoid lawsuits and the like. This is often true in Japanese media set in the modern day as well, as first names are seen as being incredibly personal and sometimes not even used by close friends who still opt to use the surname. Interestingly, the reverse is true if the work is set in some periods of Japanese history where the size of many of the clans that dominated society meant that it was hard to figure out who you were talking about if you just used the surname so given names were used more instead. In other Asian media, however, you will often hear people referred to by their first names, but almost never by their last names - partly because of the low diversity of surnames in many Asian languages.\nA common joke is to do The Un Reveal on the full name.\nThis trope can be somewhat justified, however, due to Nominal Importance: it's difficult enough for the writers to come up with good names for the main protagonists; it would be incredibly painstaking to come up with equally good names for a cast of characters who exist solely as part of the setting and serve no further purpose to the narrative.\nAnother common variation is for a series where a child is the main character to have parents only referred to as Mom and Dad.\nSometimes, a main protagonist will have no name to add to their mystique.\nOr it may be because they can't be named.\nWhen this trope is applied to work titles themselves, not just character names, it's No Title.\nCompare The Trope Without a Title, You Know the One, and I Know Your True Name (which may be a reason for this). Contrast Only One Name, Everyone Calls Him \"Barkeep\", and I Am Not Shazam. Compare and contrast The Scottish Trope, for where characters know a name, but actively avoid saying it. See also Nameless Narrative and The All-Concealing \"I\". When a character genuinely has no name whatsoever (as opposed to it not being given in the work), then they are The Nameless. If the character's parents never named them, then they were Never Given a Name. When a character is literally given the name \"Nobody\", then they are Somebody Named Nobody.\n"}
{"UptownBoy": "You know the story. It's a love story.\nOur lovers are from different worlds \u2014 one wealthy, one not. The poor girl has fallen in love with the Gentleman Snarker, or the Unlucky Everydude secretly courts the daughter of the richest man in town. And she loves him too. Maybe it was Love at First Sight. Maybe she has a habit of slipping out to the seedier side of town for a night of fun. Maybe they've been friends their whole lives and the difference in status never really mattered. Will their love be enough to let them be happy together?\nIn any case, this is usually played out in one of three ways:\nWhen the rich girl wants nothing to do with the poor guy, but slowly warms up to him, it's a different trope entirely.\nNote that the roles aren't locked by gender: a working-class girl who loves a rich boy also fits this trope, as do two lovers of the same gender.\nA relationship variant of the Odd Couple and quite often overlaps with Nobody Thinks It Will Work. Also often leads to cases of I Can't Believe a Guy Like You Would Notice Me, either with severe case of insecurity (like the third type above), or simply the poor guy being constantly feeling lucky and appreciative that someone so rich could fall for him. If it's not just the fact that she comes from money, but that he feels like she's above him, she's a Peerless Love Interest. Compare with All Girls Want Bad Boys, which often follows the same socioeconomic groups (or the inverse, if the girl is The Ingenue and the boy is an Gentleman Snarker or Spoiled Brat). Can overlap with Single Woman Seeks Good Man as it is the guy's personality that wins her heart (as is the case mentioned above).\nNot to be confused with the Brittany Murphy film Uptown Girls, which doesn't use this trope. Not to be confused with City Mouse either.\nThis is transitioning into Dead Horse Trope territory, since interclass marriage is no longer shocking, and the expectation that men should be the breadwinner in the family is much weaker today than it used to be. On the other hand, it may become an Undead Horse Trope with the emergence of culture wars and new waves of social stratification.\nFor the non-romantic variant, see Interclass Friendship. For the version endemic to India, see Type Caste, although that trope is not restricted solely to marriage and relationships.\n"}
{"WroteTheBookOnIt": "A Stock Phrase commonly used when a character complains or brags about something, to which another character disregards their comment by saying something around the lines of \"Don't tell me about that, I wrote the book on it!\". There are two distinct contexts in which this gets used:\nGenerally, the \"book\" in question is just hyperbole and no such thing was ever published; although this can be parodied if it's claimed that they \"literally wrote the book on it\".\nCommon variations include \"X? I'm the king of X!\", \"I invented X!\" and \"X is my middle name!\" Again, usually hyperbole, except when it isn't.\n"}
{"SameFaceDifferentName": "Sometimes an artist who is known for a particular area of expertise gets tired of the same old thing and wants to try something new. Most of the time, these creative people sign their own work, satisfied to ride their own coat-tails. Other times, the artist feels that they need to hide their actual identity behind a new name.\nThere are several reasons for this. Sometimes, it's just that the artist wants to succeed or fail on the merits of the new work and wants to avoid the impression that they are simply riding their previous fame to new glory. Sometimes the new area is questionable or not seen as \"up to standard\". And other times they just want to avoid squicking their own fanbase.\nThis is a Sub-Trope of Pen Name, where the person in question is already known, and successful, by another identity. For example, Marshall Mathers issuing records as Eminem is still the same old rap music; but if Eminem used the name \"Bohunk Anthrax\" to publish a country album, it would count as Same Face, Different Name.\nFor books in particular, once the secret comes out they will probably be republished as by \"Well-Known Name writing as Different Name\", with the well-known name in much bigger letters.\nCompare with Moustache de Plume. Sounds similar to, but isn't, Only Six Faces, where many characters have the same faces and different names. If it's a case of Different Face, Same Name, then you're looking for Collective Identity.\n"}
{"FrequentlyBrokenUnbreakableVow": "A character who makes The Promise, must follow the Prime Directive, or is otherwise The Fettered who will be forced to break it... repeatedly. Usually they'll face a veritable parade of situations that force them to choose whether To Be Lawful or Good, Godzilla Thresholds that require heartless necessity, and otherwise constantly force them to compromise their word and/or morals to win, do what's right, survive and/or protect the people they love.\nThis may take a variety of forms, for example the Actual Pacifist will be turned into a Reluctant Warrior who has to kill to protect the innocent. The Captain will be forced to choose repeatedly between the completion of their orders and the lives of Innocent Bystanders. The Watcher will be compelled off his True Neutral vague fence sitting into taking a side. On a smaller scale, any parent or lover promising to \"spend time\" with a loved one will be called away to duty... not that the loved one ever understands or puts up with for long.\nExpect The Fettered and The Cape with a Heroic Vow to be especially prone to suffer this, though the Noble Demon may be an infrequent target. See also Oddly Common Rarity. If the story has Magically Binding Contracts involved, they'll be as binding as warm swiss cheese. Unless it isn't. If the vow is only broken once or twice, then it's Batman Grabs a Gun.\n"}
{"HowTheCharacterStoleChristmas": "Any story in a show that is a take on How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (even if it's a different holiday).\nBasically, a villainous character attempts to stop a beloved holiday from coming by stealing all the material elements of the occasion. However, he is stunned to see that all his victims care about is the holiday's true spiritual significance, which he could not steal. The villain is so profoundly moved that he has a change of heart, returns all his loot without prompting and is welcomed to celebrate the occasion with his former victims.\nThe story isn't in the public domain, but as long as they are clear parodies, the plot isn't violating any copyrights.\nA Sub-Trope of Whole Plot Reference (so anything less than the plot is merely a Shout-Out).\nSister Trope to Yet Another Christmas Carol, \"Gift of the Magi\" Plot, Christmas Every Day, and It's a Wonderful Plot.\nCompare Saving Christmas. See also Usurping Santa.\nNot to be confused with The Grinch, which is the name for a character type (albeit one which might be likely to try this ploy).\n"}
{"Pornomancer": "Does sex just happen as naturally as breathing around you? When you meet up with a very attractive person, is the next shot always of the clothes hitting the floor? Does an instant harem/stable appear at your house? Perhaps you have a Compelling Voice, and take it to its logical conclusion. You almost certainly make Bow Chicka Wow Wow music on the soundtrack when you walk down the street. People will look.\nYou, my friend, are The Pornomancer. In pornographic movies, the characters usually don't earn their sexual conquests so much as receive them from some greater power\u2026 whether that power is in-universe magic or simply a godlike, but lazy, writer or director (or both). There wouldn't be much of a porn movie if the characters didn't have sex, and nobody involved\u2014including most of the audience\u2014cares whether the seduction would be plausible in the real world. So it isn't. Thus, in the grand tradition of wizards who are helpful to lazy writers, this field of study is known as \"pornomancy.\"\nOften pornomancers are a walking Deus Sex Machina, but they can exist in more family-friendly works, such as The Casanova in a sit-com, or the Femme Fatale in a detective show. Pornomancy is often exhibited by Stupid Sexy Flanders and any other character so hot that they engender attraction from same-sex heterosexuals.\nPornomancy is sometimes blatantly supernatural in a work, particularly in Hentai, where powers are almost immediately used for their most sexual application upon being obtained or there's actually a loose magical justification for all that sexing, but more often the cause of a character's ability to make respected citizens become slobbering sex maniacs is completely non-magical within the context of the show's universe: it simply starts off as an Informed Ability and everyone pretty much accepts it as a given (with the occasional Hand Wave when writers feel frisky). Even if the show has no established super-normal content, pornomancy is still possible through TV magic.\nThe Pornomancer is a non-gendered trope often combined with The Casanova, Even the Guys Want Him, Even the Girls Want Her, The Vamp, Femme Fatale, Stupid Sexy Flanders, and other tropes that take note of the tendency of characters in fiction to have  nigh supernatural powers of getting laid. Kavorka Man would be a sub-trope; by definition his power over women is mysterious and ill-defined. In worlds where magic or its sci-fi equivalent exist, this is often related to Power Perversion Potential.\nAversions of this trope occur when, for example, The Casanova \"earns\" the conquest plausibly to the viewers. Subversions take place when the Informed Ability turns out to be just that\u2026 for example, the Femme Fatale's charms fail and she strikes out miserably; it's also a subversion when the person with said powers knows he or she can use them for sex, but doesn't.\nIt's also possible for a person to have this ability but not want to use it. If the Pornomancer is apathetic or even against his/her own abilities, they are an Accidental Pornomancer.\nIf he/she enthousiastically takes on the sex offered, it results in Really Gets Around.\nMore scholarly tropers should note that the prefix of \"pornomancer\" is being used in its more modern sense of an abbreviation of \"pornography\" rather than carrying the direct meaning of the root word \"porn?\" meaning \"prostitute\".\nWhen used as a defined in-universe power, this is a subtrope of Whatevermancy, but doesn't have to be. When it's just implied because the writers want a character to have improbable fornication skills, it is not.\n"}
{"OedipalComplex": "The Oedipal archetype deals with any conflict between father and son, particularly where the son must supplant the patriarch or must extricate himself from his father's shadow and find his own place in the world.\nMuch of the time this presents as the son's aim of removing his father to further himself in the eyes of his mother, not necessarily into her bed. This archetype shares some themes with both the Messianic Archetype (rebirth and renewal) and The Trickster (out with the old, in with the new).\nThe female equivalent, of wanting to kill the mother and sleep with the father, was called the \"Electra complex\" by Carl Jung, but this term was rejected by Freud, saying that \"Oedipus complex\" sufficed for both men and womennote\u00a0a bit Hilarious in Hindsight since most modern Freudian apologists claim girls also want to supplant their fathers. Freud was generally critical of what he felt was Carl Jung's facile separation of male and female traits when according to him both men and women have masculine and feminine traits. This makes sense, since the character of Electra in the plays of both Sophocles (who wrote Oedipus the King) and Euripides saw her more in filial love and deep mourning for her father and in need of some good revenge against her murderous mother. The story of this family is another trope altogether, anyway.\nOedipus the King, the Greek Tragedy dramatized in BC 429 by Sophocles, is the Trope Namer, and Sigmund Freud is the Trope Codifier. Oedipus, however, is not an example of the trope because Oedipus never knew who his mother and father were until it was too late. The Oedipus is not someone secretly wants to kill his father and sleep with his mother\u2014he's a man who desperately doesn't want to, but ends up doing so anyways because You Can't Fight Fate.\nThe supplanting part is key here. Without it, you've just got Calling the Old Man Out\u2014when someone calls his dad out for his transgressions, but doesn't supplant him. If the supplanting takes the form of murder, it's Patricide and Murder in the Family. If there's an explicitly sexual relationship, see Parental Incest. If there's a partner who's like their parent, see Like Parent, Like Spouse. And if there's incestuous subtext without wanting to supplant anyone, then it's just Incest Subtext. See also Archnemesis Dad, which makes the father figures into outright villains while leaving out the Freudian implications. Compare Jealous Parent. Also compare \"Well Done, Son!\" Guy\u2014who actually wants his father's approval.\n"}
{"TigerByTheTail": "A character (possibly with the best of intentions) has started or gotten involved in something which has become dangerous or taken an evil turn, but which they cannot just stop doing or walk away from without facing terrible consequences. This can be a case of either Gone Horribly Wrong or Gone Horribly Right depending on the circumstances. The idiom comes from the idea that if you catch a tiger by the tail, you can never let go unless you want to be eaten. Also known as \"riding a tiger\" from the Chinese idiom \"riding a tiger and unable to get off.\"\nPerhaps the character started a protest movement that has become violently fanatical, and would execute them as a traitor if they tried to mitigate its behavior. Maybe they stumbled into a MacGuffin and the government is now after them until they Clear Their Name, or they jumped into the pilot seat of a Humongous Mecha to repel the alien invasion, only to find It Won't Turn Off, and has Crush. Kill. Destroy! tendencies it would love to try out on them if they ever try to disembark.\nUnlike with I've Come Too Far and Sunk Cost Fallacy, it's not a matter of the character not wanting their efforts or expenses to go to waste. It's that they will die or otherwise suffer terribly if they don't carry on. If a good guy gets into this situation (and the work isn't cynical,) there will usually turn out to be a third option, or outside intervention to help him.\nSee also Godzilla Threshold, which can involve knowingly getting into this; and \"Fawlty Towers\" Plot and Crime After Crime, which can be this depending on the circumstances (although the former is usually more lighthearted in the stakes.) This can sometimes be a Morton's Fork if disaster from stopping or carrying on seems equally inevitable.\n[[foler:Films \u2014 Live Action]]\n"}
{"BeforeIChangeMyMind": "The hero has the villain captured, in his grasp, and there's no way the villain can escape the due justice that's coming to him. As soon as the police show up, the hero informs his foe, the villain's going off to jail and will get his just reward.\nHowever, the villain responds by trying to convince the hero that he (the hero) has to let him (the villain) go free. The reasons he'll give may vary, but most usually they'll involve the point that without the villain around to enforce his particular brand of evil, someone more brutal than he is will inevitably show up to fill the void and potentially make the status quo a whole lot worse than it is at current. Or, the villain might have a very good reason for doing what he's been doing, and will let the hero know as much. Or, if the villain goes to jail, the hero won't have much other purpose in life.\nCue the hero freeing the villain from his bonds and telling him to leave now \"...before I change my mind.\"\nAlternately, reverse the scenario: the villain has the hero in his grasp and is ready, willing and able to kill him, but the hero says or does something that somehow convinces the villain not to go through with it. Or maybe the villain can't go through with it because Even Evil Has Standards, the hero has to live to serve a specific purpose, or the villain's existence will be utterly empty without the hero being there to oppose him.\nAs a result, the villain decides to free the hero and tells him to get lost \"...before I change my mind.\"\nWhat is being showcased here is an example of someone (however briefly) looking the other way or granting permission in some other manner, allowing someone else to do something they want to do, escape a particular situation, or otherwise fulfill a stated objective.\nAside from the examples listed above, the words may be used if the hero and villain had come to some kind of deal (whether on-screen or behind-the-scenes), and the villain says them to indicate that he just managed to not go back on his word.\nIt also doesn't necessarily have to be between a hero and his villain; a Big Bad, for example, may allow an underling to pursue a course of action, but if the underling hesitates in leaving, the boss may advise him/her to get to it, citing the trope's name in the process.\nNote that the exact words of the trope name don't necessarily have to be quoted in order to qualify. Alternate phrases may include \"while I'm still in a good mood\" or \"while I'm still feeling charitable.\"\nSee also Can't Kill You, Still Need You and I Gave My Word, which are situations where this may be invoked. This might also happen because the hero/villain is a Slave to PR. An Enemy Mine situation may sometimes result in this, as well.\n"}
{"OneNoteCook": "A character \u2014 frequently male \u2014 who is only able to make one specific kind of food, often because they're a Lethal Chef and attempts to diversify their efforts would end in disaster. Through harsh training, they have finally become able to make one thing that is edible, at least. If it's their Trademark Favorite Food, they're in luck. Sometimes their specialty dish is widely praised as being transcendentally delicious... they just can't transfer that skill to anything else.\nSometimes Truth in Television \u2014 it's relatively common for people who aren't particularly good at cooking (even if they're not quite at Lethal Chef levels) to be able to make a few dishes fairly well. This trope lies somewhere between Supreme Chef and Lethal Chef. Also see Crippling Overspecialization for other non-culinary examples.\n"}
{"CharClone": "A Char Clone is a character who has many traits of Char Aznable from the Gundam franchise, who inspired many copies. The Gundam series was (and is) wildly popular in Japan, with a cultural impact comparable to Star Trek or Doctor Who in the West. Char, an antagonist in the original Gundam show Mobile Suit Gundam, became the most iconic character of the series, outpacing even the main characters and the Big Bad in popularity. Given the sheer number of characters that reference, homage, or flat out are Char with a different name, they eventually became known as Char clones.\nA brief history of the original Char: in Mobile Suit Gundam, he was The Rival to the main character. A mysterious masked man with distinctive blond hair, he was an Ace Pilot called the Red Comet with a penchant for piloting Ace Custom mecha painted red (which was said to be three times faster than its mundane counterpart, despite the only visual difference being its color). Over the course of the series, it is revealed that Char has a hidden agenda \u2014 avenging his father, who was assassinated by the series Big Bad \u2014 and that his estranged sister is part of the heroes' crew. In the sequel series, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, he adopts a Paper-Thin Disguise and makes a Heel\u2013Face Turn, allying with the good guys and acting as The Mentor for the new generation. His final appearance comes in the appropriately-named Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack, where he's a villain again, attempting to drop a giant asteroid onto Earth for the good of mankind.\nExpect to see these traits in a Char clone:\nOther than those universal aspects, these characters tend to fall into one of three aspects, which could be roughly aligning with the three works Char appeared in: Mobile Suit Gundam, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, and Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack. The bolded parts is mainly the defining role of that character. When two or more of these types of Char Clone appear in a story, they need not be the same character at different points in the timeline; it's perfectly acceptable to split up Char's three primary roles into multiple clones, and indeed this is what's more often done so as to help the clones distinguish themselves from the original.\nIncidentally, Char himself is based off Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron (at least in terms of characterization. His visual design was based on Prince Sharkin of Raideen, while his name is a reference to famous French singer Charles Aznavour).\nChar Clone is a character-specific subtrope of Fountain of Expies. Compare Stock Sh\u014dnen Rival, Shana Clone, Rei Ayanami Expy, and Darth Vader Clonenote\u00a0The fact that many traits are shared between these two character archetypes is not entirely coincidental. Not to be confused with expies of Charmander, Charmeleon, and Charizard.\n"}
{"BugCasteSystem": "Oftentimes, when Bee People show up to fight a Bug War against humanity, while the humans use the full panoply of technology, including spaceships, tanks, Powered Armor, and military aircraft, the Bugs are likely to use specialized castes of their own race instead, with a large level of polymorphism between different castes of the same species to adapt them to specialized roles. This system is actually inspired by certain Real Life ants, bees and termites, who indeed come in several of the varieties seen below.\nSince the Ants and Bees that inspired this trope have all-female worker castes, this often leads to a sort of One-Gender Race.\nWhen aliens have a caste system, but the various castes are not physically very different, that's not this trope, that's Fantastic Caste System. Often leads to Crippling Overspecialization for individuals, or is a way to avoid it for the race as a whole.\n"}
{"ThatRemindsMeOfaSong": "Mainly a product of The Musical.\nThis trope most often occurs when a composer wrote a really keen song. Or if there is a big star in the movie who must have a solo. Or the director has a favorite song that he wants to put in the movie. Unfortunately, there is really no way to inject the song into the story in the traditional \"burst into song\" way. So, the writer often gives us the immortal line \"That reminds me of a song,\" or \"I feel a song coming on!\" in some occasions, or something similar and the character sits down at a piano or hops up on the stage to sing a little ditty that has... no plot significance whatsoever. (\"Let's rehearse the ___ number\" or \"Let's film our music video\" or \"Let's dance to ___\" and then doing exactly that are also popular.)\nAt its most basic, this is a song sung just to kill time, with a fairly thin excuse. The song doesn't tell us anything about the characters or the setting, it doesn't advance the plot, it doesn't serve any obvious purpose at all besides filling out the running time. If the song does have subtext, exposition, or plot-related action, and thus plot significance, it's Suspiciously Apropos Music.\nThe \"out of the blue\" musical number is a cliche often associated with Indian or \"Bollywood\" motion pictures. There is an incorrect stereotype that suggests every Bollywood film needs to have one or more musical numbers featuring upbeat songs that have little or no relation to the plot, usually featuring an attractive young singer. The term for this is an Item Number. There are enough Bollywood films without musical numbers to make this a discredited stereotype, but \"That Reminds Me of a Song\" is still a trope often associated with the genre.\nFrequent justifications include having some or all of the characters be actors or actresses, or setting one of the scenes at a nightclub or similar. It may also overlap with Hey, Let's Put on a Show, giving the characters an opportunity to \"rehearse\" the numbers they'll need to perform. A small-scale variation on the Show Within a Show. A similar variation will pop up in a Biopic of a musician, as we'll get to see them performing and practicing their Greatest Hits.\nIt still shows up here and there, often as the Breakaway Pop Hit, but is mostly a Discredited Trope. Modern musicals are specifically not supposed to do this anymore, except as a parody. For a more advanced version of this trope, one that is so out-of-nowhere that it borders on a Mind Screw, yet is never treated as anything the least bit weird by the characters and never mentioned again, see Big-Lipped Alligator Moment.\nSee also Silly Song, where the characters don't even try to justify the singing.\n"}
{"LeaderFormsTheHead": "Combining Mecha tend to combine in a humanoid form. It's easier for people to follow, and it's easier for the guys to get fitting rubber suits. When mecha combine, the parts will more or less match up with limbs, and it doesn't really matter what goes where.\nExcept when it does.\nThe \"face\" and/or torso are special parts of the combined form. They're the most identifiable, and they're generally where the cockpit is. It's why we have special importance for the locations of our brain and heart. So with mecha, the part that is most important will be formed by the personal mecha of the most important character, generally The Hero, or a spotlight stealing variety of Sixth Ranger. Because the position is special but can only be handed to one, expect Headbutting Heroes or Vitriolic Best Buds to compete for the lead position.\nAt this trope's strongest, the mecha of The Hero can be humanoid on its own, and the others will form a larger body by way of a Mecha Expansion Pack, thus an overlap with Meta Mecha. At its strangest, The Hero doesn't form the head, but it gets double subverted by having the part that does look suspiciously matching to the mecha of The Hero.\nBecause Red Is Heroic, this leads to a lot of ensemble mechas being a bit red in the face. Also, compare the color patterns on an All Your Colors Combined attack. The main character's color illogically in the middle? This will probably be in effect when the robots show up.\n"}
{"SunkCostFallacy": "Sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias that causes Bob to remain committed to a course of action because he's already spent time or resources on it, even though the commitment is irrational (i.e. he would be better off walking away). When Bob is engaging in this fallacy, he will remain set on the course of action even if the profit from his success would be less than what he's already spent.\nHis line of thought might run thus:\nThis trope is not merely Bob's commitment to a course of action because he's invested too much to turn back. If Bob has already made the down payment on a house, for example, he is likely to continue in the purchase of that house since he would lose money for no gain if he stops. In order for a situation to be the Sunk Cost Fallacy, it must be one where (1) Bob remains committed to a course of action in order to justify what he has already spent on it and (2) it is obvious to any rational person that the cost of staying in now will exceed the cost of simply stopping now, taking on the loss, and moving on.\nThis forms a particularly powerful combination with the Gambler's Fallacy, since Bob will not only continue because he does not want to have wasted his money, but also because the very fact he has made losses is evidence he is \"due\" for a win. These two false forms of reasoning drive ruinous gambling problems.\nCompare I've Come Too Far. Contrast Know When to Fold 'Em.\n"}
{"TheTrainsRunOnTime": "Fascism: a model of brutal efficiency. Sure, the loss of freedom sucks, but the trains run on time, poverty, corruption, and crime have been eliminated, and the armies march like clockwork. Just keep your head down, do your job, ignore the occasional sound of dissidents being dragged from their homes in the dead of night, and things will be pretty okay.\nThis trope is when fascism or some other authoritarian, draconian, and/or brutal system of government is shown to be more efficient and competent than other more representative or liberal systems and relatively unaffected by problems of logistics, corruption, crime, poverty, etc. for this reason. In extreme examples, such a regime can be portrayed as darn near a utopia, if it weren't for that pesky lack of freedom and/or death penalty for jaywalking.\nIn some cases, the general populace may actually want the dictatorship if the alternative is somehow worse. The king may tax his subjects heavily, and he doesn't take kindly to his decisions being questioned...but on the other hand he's also brutally efficient in dealing with the bandits and orcs who would otherwise rob and kill you, and you actually have some chance of living peacefully without ending up on an ogre's dinner menu. When you live in a Crapsack World, you often have to make a Morton's Fork choice.\nIn Real Life, this is averted at least as often as played straight. Authoritarianism is notoriously plagued by corruption, and even when dictatorships work relatively well, those that are based around a Cult of Personality tend to crumble on their leader's death. It's noteworthy that in Nazi Germany itself, the trains were in fact notoriously unreliable... not least because the Nazis promoted the use of automobiles and invested in the autobahns at the expense of trains and the railways even though Germany produced neither rubber nor oil and was one of the world's leading producers of steel and coal (on the grounds that automobiles were 'more advanced' and 'more modern' than trains). Consequently they actually had fewer trains in 1939 than they had in 1914, and ran out of (unused) tires in mid-July 1941 after the second week of their campaign against the USSR. And, contrary to popular belief, Mussolini did not make the trains run on time, his regime actually being the polar opposite. Remember also, that fascism came to power in countries which were already developed and that a good deal of its vaunted \"efficiency\" is blurred by the pre-takeover infrastructure continuing afterwards.\nA subtrope of No Delays for the Wicked, which is when villains (individuals as well as groups) have an easier time dealing with logistics because of Rule of Drama, whether there's an in-story explanation or not. Compare and contrast The Extremist Was Right, which deals with a single character as opposed to a system of government. In settings where fascism is not only more efficient than more liberal forms of government, but more liberal forms of government prove fundamentally unworkable, it's because Hobbes Was Right and Democracy Is Bad.\nContrast Fascist, but Inefficient and Dystopia Is Hard.\n"}
{"CopycatKiller": "If you want to make a big splash on the criminal scene, you've got to make your crime memorable. And what's the best way to do that? Why, to duplicate a crime that's already memorable.\nThis is Jack the Ripoff's modus operandi. In fact, you could say that Jack doesn't actually have a modus operandi at all, because he's just copying the M.O. of some past crime (not his own, of course; that would make him a serial criminal). Usually an especially (in)famous one or one that was never solved. There can be any number of reasons to commit a copycat crime:\nCopycat killers are a very common plot twist in police dramas, movies, and mystery novels where the plot involves serial killings. The copycat may occasionally serve as a Red Herring - the detectives think they've caught the killer, but it turns out he was just a copycat and there's still a serial killer on the loose. (Although, in Real Life, investigators of a serial killer often keep some details from being released to the public in order to tell a possible copycat apart from the main suspect, and some realistic crime novels mention this as well.) Alternatively they could be tempted to doubt they have the right guy because the crimes haven't stopped.\nIf the original killer is still around, don't expect him to be pleased (unless he sees it as a compliment, or is able to use it as The Alibi). Authorities investigating the copycat may be looking to consult with the original killer in trying to catch their suspect.\nFor cases where a real-life serial killer inspires imitators in fiction, see Ripped from the Headlines.\nNamed, of course, after the infamous (and unidentified) Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper, who has indeed inspired a few real-life copycats, such as the Yorkshire Ripper and Jack the Stripper.\n"}
{"OpinionMyopia": "A fan is shocked to find that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has made so much money! Surely the low Rotten Tomatoes rating should have tipped viewers off. Okay, even if they didn't care about those, surely they would have seen how horrible it was for themselves after the first weekend. What are they? Sheep?\nConversely, how could Serenity not have made loads of money? Okay, many people didn't know about the movie, but surely word of mouth would have carried. And the blogs went wild for it!\nWell, the truth is that some people genuinely like Michael Bay movies such as Transformers, and that works like Firefly just don't appeal to everyone. If the fan can't or won't understand that, then they have Opinion Myopia. To take it further, some people even believe that what you like and dislike determines what kind of person you are.\nThe formal academic term for this phenomenon is the \"false consensus effect\", where a person tends to overestimate the extent to which their beliefs or opinions are typical of those of others. It's also related to Confirmation Bias in that people tend to ignore evidence that might prove their cherished opinions are inaccurate.\nA Super Trope to Fan Hater (hating people directly for positive opinions you don't agree with), Complaining about People Not Liking the Show (getting upset about negative opinions you don't agree with), He Panned It, Now He Sucks! (same but with reviews), Fan Myopia (fans thinking that the subject of their fandom must be well known and generally liked).

{"IShallFightNoMoreForever": "Bob, possibly a Fallen Hero or Atoner, refuses to fight any longer. He decides he would rather become an Actual Pacifist or Technical Pacifist, or retreat from the world altogether.\nThe reasons for this vary. Perhaps Bob now has (or gave someone) a dead relative, or maybe they just think their quest has come to an end (though their opponents probably would beg to differ.) They may have simply met the one person who could convince him that murder is not always the answer. It could be a simple case of being beaten so badly and so often that they just give up completely.\nFrequently, this becomes a 10-Minute Retirement, and Bob's once again forced to draw his sword and kill again.

{"NoGearLevel": "A level where the player is stripped of all weapons and equipment. It most often is justified by having the character arrested/captured/imprisoned (usually in a case of Cutscene Incompetence), but there are other means of losing your stuff, such as an airplane crash or shipwreck. They may be able to acquire new weapons and equipment, rebuilding their inventory as they go along, or may just have to complete a segment of the game by using abilities which are not so easily removed, such as stealth, unarmed combat, or innate powers or magical abilities.\nIf the player is ever able to regain their original inventory, expect it to be stashed all together in an easily accessible package, unused by the enemy.\nSee also A Taste of Power (an inversion of this which gives you late-game equipment in the very beginning of the game), Second Hour Superpower (when the first level is played without gear), Bag of Spilling (loss of equipment between games), So Long, and Thanks for All the Gear and No Item Use for You. A variant of Unexpected Gameplay Change.\n"}
{"DogPileofDoom": "A large number of Mooks jump on the hero, pinning him down.\nUsually it's a climactic battle scene. The hero is facing down dozens, no, hundreds, no, THOUSANDS of mooks. At first, the hero's doing well. He's smiting them one after another. But, then he begins to get tired, and first one, then another, then another and another and another leap onto him, dragging the poor guy to the ground.\nOften, a bigger villain, such as the Big Bad or The Dragon, stands by and watches.\nThere are several ways that this scene can turn out:\nType A: The hero activates a super mode, has an epiphany, or otherwise becomes more badass. He explodes out of the pile, minions scattering to the four winds, and rises as an epic figure. At this point the fight might continue, or the mooks might run away.\nType B: The hero is killed at the bottom of the pile. (This one is pretty rare outside of zombie movies, actually.)\nType C: Similar to B, except that the hero is captured instead of killed. This can mean assimilation, frozen in stasis, knocked unconscious, or simply dragged off to a prison cell.\nType D: A more humorous version, the hero simply gets out of the dogpile. This may involve Offscreen Teleportation, with the hero suddenly appearing to the side somewhere (or even on top of the pile), before the mooks even realize that he's gone and they've just been mobbing each other.\nIn order to qualify as a Dog Pile of Doom, the hero should be completely covered in mooks. Just a couple of guys jumping on top of the hero is not enough to qualify. Have you ever dropped a piece of food on an anthill? It's something like that.\nDiffers from the glomp, because the glomp is a sign of affection (even though the victim might not like it). The Dog Pile of Doom is malicious, intended to kill or capture.\nOften an Obligatory Joke whenever American football appears in fiction.\nTechnically, it doesn't have to be the hero at the bottom of the pile. A whole bunch of good guy civilian mooks jumping on the Big Bad would also count as a Dog Pile of Doom.\n"}
{"AlbumTitleDrop": "Sometimes, albums aren't named for one of the songs on them \u2014 they're named for one of the lyrics within these songs. So, when you're listening, you think \"Oh, that's where the title comes from!\".

See also Cover Drop.\n"}
{"MsFanService": "A female character who provides a significant amount of Fanservice (generally for males), ranging from simple revealing of cleavage, midriff, shoulders or legs, to shots of her curves, hips or derriere (even when covered).\nHer clothing is mainly there to accentuate her figure. Her wardrobe mainstays are bikinis/swimsuits, lingerie, fishnets, stockings, garters, Dangerously Short Skirts, equally short shorts, thigh high boots or stiletto pumps, and low-cut dresses and shirts. Alternatively, she might be covered from head to toe, thus showing no skin at all, but her costume will be tight and stretchy enough to show her bust and the outline of her hips. Bonus points if she's The Tease. In general, she will appear more often in merchandise aimed towards males to further attract males to the product, with vice versa being the case for Mr. Fanservice.\nThere are several types of Ms. Fanservice:\nEither way, the camera seems to have the hots for her, and the viewing audience is expected to feel the same way. The real trick is to make it so that being eye candy doesn't make her a Flat Character. Besides, being \"flat\" usually doesn't fit this type of character.\nPlease note that there is no requirement to be single to fit into this trope. Many of these characters are married. For the Spear Counterpart, see Mr. Fanservice. If she also sleeps with most of the crew, she either Really Gets Around or is a Good Bad Girl. Subjected to multiple Double Standard tropes, especially if she gets a nice dose of Character Development or Hidden Depths aside from her hot looks, and yet the fandom refuses to see them.\nCompare Hello, Nurse!, and contrast the Token Wholesome.\n"}
{"ThoseWhoFightMonsters": "Usually, not quite a villain, but they act antagonistically enough that they're little better. Something has happened to our Fallen Hero: his village was destroyed, his friends killed, his puppy roasted on an open spit, his bike stolen, whatever. All that matters is that It's Personal, and he feels that the law just isn't suitable enough (or has become too corrupt and ignorant) to be of any use to him in settling the matter. He may justify his actions by claiming that it's Justice he's after, not vengeance, but anyone with half a brain can easily see that he's out for Revenge... unfortunately, we can also see that the more he hunts the cause of his woes, the more he takes on the villain's personality and mannerisms\u2014something that our \"hero\" is too blinded by his single-minded goal to realize.\nOur avenger may have good intentions\u2014the fiend may well be too dangerous to be kept alive\u2014but ultimately, his obsession with dealing out due punishment (or worse) and his refusal to think about what he's doing twists him into a monster just as bad as, or even worse than, the one he's hunting. And even before he gets to that point, it's nigh-impossible to turn him away; calling him out on it will be ignored or retaliated against. The Power of Friendship and The Power of Love were lost to him the moment the atrocity that sent him on his wild goose chase happened; he feels that Team Spirit is just a hindrance, and that Love Is a Weakness that he can't afford to have. Heel Realizations will be ignored. Don't expect him to make a Heroic Sacrifice or Heel\u2013Face Turn anytime soon; if he dies in the process of bringing his nemesis down, it's usually with him crossing into Villainstown in his moment of glory. If he doesn't die...\nThe \"fighting monsters\" line represents what is a recognizable Moral Event Horizon for heroes, and both Anti-Heroes and Well-Intentioned Extremists live just near the boundary, especially the more pitiless Good Is Not Nice, Unfettered, Pragmatic Hero types. Engaging in Van Helsing Hate Crimes is a good indicator of having crossed the boundary and a Knight Templar is most certainly beyond it.\nAs expected, this twisted situation is very popular in the Revenge Tragedy genre, especially because of its inherent Dramatic Irony. note\u00a0Nietzsche himself was also inspired by Ancient Greek tragic antihero archetypes; see also his first book The Birth of Tragedy. This trope can also be used to demonstrate how \"eye-for-an-eye\" justice, while sounding like sweet Karmic Equivalent Exchange Justice at first, can easily spiral out into utter chaos if the hero lets his passions, wrath, and Pride forgo rationality.\nMay be expressed through the page quote, or via the common misquote \"When you become obsessed with the enemy, you become the enemy\".\nNot to be confused with Complete Monster, although somebody can well become one by fighting such monsters. They can range from Anti-Hero to anywhere above. See also Cycle of Revenge, The Dark Side Will Make You Forget, Protagonist Journey to Villain, You Are What You Hate, Then Let Me Be Evil, and Became Their Own Antithesis. If this trope happens to a child, it can be used as a Freudian Excuse of a character who Used to Be a Sweet Kid. Compare And Then John Was a Zombie, where the character becomes a literal monster. If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him is pretty much a sped-up version of this. Political equivalents are The Horseshoe Effect, Reign of Terror, Full-Circle Revolution, and Meet the New Boss. If the monster in question is an animal, that's Animal Nemesis. If the monster is supernatural, it's a decidedly unheroic instance of Hunter of Monsters. Subtrope of Slowly Slipping Into Evil.\nNot to be confused with Those Who Hunt Elves, or Monster Hunter. For the Rosario + Vampire fanfic, see He Who Fights Monsters (though this one is an example of this trope).\n"}
{"BrandNamesAreBetter": "One of the more Common Fan Fallacies that exists is that products that carry brand names are higher in quality, taste better, last longer, and so on than lesser known names or even generic products. Related to this is the idea that, the more expensive something is, the better it will be. Neither of these ideas is necessarily so... it is often proved that the only real difference between High Priced Brand X and Generic Product Y is the name on the label.\nSometimes it is true that the more expensive product might have been made with higher-quality materials, thus justifying the price tag as opposed to the off-brand, but this isn't always the case, as many store-brand items have the exact same ingredient list. Indeed, this trope is all about how people prefer the name brands, when the difference just isn't there. Also, it is very common for many big name companies to make a generic/store brand version of the product as well, which means that the only differences are the price and packaging.\nCan be a form of Up Marketing if the brand name is intentionally designed to appeal to wealthy shoppers. See also Conspicuous Consumption, when flaunting the brand name gives the perception of class. Also related to the Placebo Effect, in that the belief of an item's better quality may be enough to make it really seem better.\nCompare Expensive Glass of Crap, when switching the labels on a cheap and an expensive product is all it takes to convince would-be snobs that the cheap one is better quality.\n"}

{"SmallNameBigEGo": "A character with a comically over-inflated image of himself. He thinks he's smarter than everyone else, thinks he's a real ladies' man, thinks he's cool, thinks it's all about him, but both his fellow characters and the audience know that it's all in his mind.\nOften occurs in conjunction with a Show Within a Show. If the TV Series runs long enough, the writers usually devote one episode to a Big Ego, Hidden Depths examination of the character.\nExpect this guy to be a victim of Pride. Said characters often insult or look down on those who have far more to be proud of and who generally flaunt it less. When they are faced with such characters, whether in a competition or in a comparison of abilities, it tends to be humiliating, and might even be a much needed reality check. Also, don't expect these characters to handle criticism (either of them or of the abilities that they're egotistical about) very well.\nIf (s)he is the main character on a show, we're dealing with a species of Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist. If the writers, not the character (though he can fit this trope, underscoring his unpopularity) think the character is amazing, we have the Creator's Pet.\nIf the character is a nerd and unaware of it, he's an Extraverted Nerd. If he makes a big deal of how heroic and badass he is, but runs at the first sign of real danger, he's a Miles Gloriosus. If he claims to be a genius, but is incredibly dim or just misinformed, he's the Know-Nothing Know-It-All. If he thinks he's a brilliant artist but is actually dire, he's Giftedly Bad. If he claims to kick ass only to get his own ass constantly kicked, he's a Boisterous Weakling. Contrast Insufferable Genius (where he actually has the skill to back himself up) or Almighty Janitor. Every Year They Fizzle Out and Fake Ultimate Hero, meanwhile, are when everyone else are the ones with a high opinion about the person in question. Often a Large Ham. In more serious works, he will often be the victim of Break the Haughty. The Smug Snake could be considered a villainous variation, and the Narcissist is this taken to the extreme. Might be a Paper Tiger or even a Dirty Coward.\nThe opposite of this trope is Heroic Self-Deprecation, where the hero actually does have many notable achievements, but doesn't believe or refuses to believe that he is loved by many, and mostly refers to himself in a negative manner. Also contrast Humble Hero, who achieved a lot, but is not nearly that big about it.\nContrast with the Jaded Washout, who knows only too well how pathetic he is.

{"Transplant": "When a character leaves one show to join the cast of another (often because the original show has ended).

{"BelowDecksEpisode": "An episode focused primarily on otherwise minor characters, using their point of view to give an outsider's perspective on the central plot or characters (countering the assumption that The Main Characters Do Everything). Not coincidentally, the principal actors are needed a lot less for this sort of episode than in a typical episode. Lower Deck Episodes usually arise when the crew is behind on their film schedules and have to shoot two episodes at the same time. They are sometimes included as a special feature for the DVD/Blu-Ray release of Hollywood films, particularly animated films. The main character/s are seldom entirely absent, since they have to get their Mandatory Line in somewhere.\nNamed for Lower Decks, episode #167 of Star Trek: The Next Generation, an episode that is notable for both revisiting the life of a minor character from an earlier episode and killing off that same character before we actually see the changes previous events have wrought.\nSee A Day in the Limelight for a secondary character given the spotlight and Villain Episode for villains.

{"ArtifactDomination": "An item of power, usually magical (or \"magical\") in nature, exerts some kind of mind control on its user. This is usually attached to a curse placed upon the item by its original owner, however it can be within the purview of a Living Weapon, an Empathic Weapon or a Talking Weapon to do this on its own. The object may also be acting as a Soul Jar, or the \"can\" of Sealed Evil in a Can and whatever is in it wants out. Oftentimes associated with an Artifact of Doom, and perhaps its capacity to possess its users is exactly what makes it \"...of Doom\". This can also be the result of Misapplied Phlebotinum or an imperfect understanding of the object by the characters using it. Whatever the case using, possessing or in some cases just being near the object allows it to exert mind control over sentient beings. This is usually in the form of a compulsion to act a certain way, ranging from general behavior influences (compulsion to commit certain acts like theft or murder, or act good/evil) or outright command to take a specific set of actions to lead to the object's desired outcome. Conversely, this may also reference an instance where touching an item leads directly to some kind of possession by an entity inhabiting the object.\nSub-Trope of Artifact of Power. Heavily associated with Artifact of Doom though not exclusively. One of the leading causes of With Great Power Comes Great Insanity, though not the only one by any means. Can lead to Grand Theft Me, or Demonic Possession, but is not in and of itself demonic possession. Though largely a trope of evil, it's not exclusively evil.

{"DoingResearch": "A new monster has arrived in town and it\u2019s already beaten off our heroes once.

They search the Omniscient Database and scan samples with the Everything Sensor, possibly with the help of a Hard-Work Montage. Only when all avenues have been exhausted will they summarise their findings and formulate a new plan (which the audience may or may not be privy to).\nDoing Research is the favourite pastime of Mr. Exposition, The Smart Guy, the Badass Bookworm and The Team Normal.

{"FranchiseDrivenRetitling": "Sometimes people come up with a name that is perfectly reasonable for a work but is not reasonable for a franchise and with a new franchise being built, they have to go back and rename the work for all future promotional materials.\nThis can often come about because the title of the first work depends heavily on an element in that work but not in the others. Possibly, the executives have chosen a theme to market and name the series (such as the lead character's name) and the early installment is the odd man out.\nNaturally this can be happening when you have a first work that nobody was sure was going to be popular and so they didn't think of a franchise when naming it. It can also happen during an adaptation process \u2014 book series often also only pick up a series name much further down the line, often unofficially, and often don't bother with this process. When they come to being adapted to another medium, somebody will have plans for a franchise but not a name.\nSubtrope of Retronym, can help lead to Early Installment Weirdness.\n"}
{"Manhua": "Manhua (Traditional: \u6f2b\u756b Simplified: \u6f2b\u753b; pinyin: m\u00e0nhu\u00e0) is the general term for Chinese-language comics and print cartoons, and is applied both to works originally written in Chinese, and translated comics. The Chinese characters for manhua are identical to those used for Japanese manga and Korean manhwa. On the same note, the term for the creator of comics in Chinese is \u6f2b\u753b\u5bb6/\u6f2b\u756b\u5bb6 (m\u00e0n hu\u00e0 ji\u0101), its characters the same as the ones in Japanese mangaka (\u6f2b\u753b\u5bb6) and Korean manhwaga (\ub9cc\ud654\uac00, hanja form \u6f2b\u7575\u5bb6).\nManhua can be considered simultaneously the older and younger relative of manga. Manhua works were widely published and read in China from the 1920's, often with political or satirical content, predating Japan's manga development in the post-WWII period. However, after WWII, China didn't get the same luck like Japan did - the Chinese Civil War placed creative development on hold for another few years, and creative oppression on both sides further strained production, long enough for manga to become a serious powerhouse on the international scene, though Hong Kong remained somewhat independent and developed on its own.\nEven after things got better in the 80s, development was slow and manga influences were visible. Modern works have mainly been published in Hong Kong and Taiwan, though Mainland China also has a growing scene post-2000. Today, manhua can be found on sale anywhere with a large Chinese-speaking population.\nSingapore also has Mandarin Chinese as one of its official languages, so some of its comic books can also be considered manhua.\nThe art style in manhua is generally more realistic than is typical of Japanese manga, and normally drawn in full color. The order Chinese manhua are read in depends on the situation: more traditional ones tend to be read from right to left, while more modern ones tend to be read from left to right.\nSee also Manga (Japanese), Manhwa (Korean), OEL Manga (English), and Webcomics (digital publishing). For the ease of categorizing, Chinese webcomics will also be listed on this page.\n"}

{"YouBetterSitDown": "Bad news is of course hard to tell to other people (unless someone is feeling malicious), which means it's preferable in those circumstances to try to break the news as gently as possible.\nThere are several methods. One of the most common in fiction is to tell the recipient to sit down before hearing the news, often in case the news is upsetting enough to cause Fainting. Often, to show how tough or badass they are, the listener usually says, through clenched jaws, \"I think I'll stand\" or \"I prefer to stand\" or some variation thereof.\nRegardless of the delivery, how the recipient reacts can vary, before and after hearing the news. Before, some might be so anxious, they can shout \"Just Tell Me!\", while others might ask for a minute to prep themselves. After, some can be happy (if the news was actually in their favor without the bearer knowing it), and some can react even worse than the bearer feared.\nA staple trope of both the Police Procedural and the Medical Drama, in which breaking the news of a loved one's death is regularly portrayed as the most difficult part of a cop's/doctor's job.\nA Dramatic Sit-Down is likely at some point.\nAnd it should be noted that methods have been around long enough for many to be discredited. Expect many instances of this trope to be Played for Laughs. One common gag is Bad News, Irrelevant News.\nA Sub-Trope of Bearer of Bad News. A Super Trope to Bad News in a Good Way, Good News, Bad News.\nHas nothing to do with Breaking Bad.\n"}
{"NeverSayGoodbye": "So, the chances of survival look slim. Maybe there really is no way out. So one of our heroes tries to take a moment to let his or her companions know how much s/he loves them, and what a hell of a ride it's been, etc...\nBut their companions aren't having any of it. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa,\" they will often say. Maybe because they don't want their loved one to accept death as inevitable, maybe they just find the whole idea of a touching goodbye speech embarrassing and awkward. But in any case they refuse to let the would-be speechifier continue.\nBut if either one of them really is going to die, the one who cut off the other will often, quite hypocritically really, deliver a speech of his own. Sometimes even immediately.\nCompare Never Say \"Die\", How Dare You Die on Me!, Never Got to Say Goodbye, I \"Uh\" You, Too, Cannot Spit It Out.\n"}
{"TheTamingOfTheGrue": "Monsters exist all over folklore. Dragons, vampires, werewolves, etc. And usually, they start out as Always Chaotic Evil as they come, or even just mindless beasts who destroy because they don't know any better.\nExcept, as a particular monster gets more popular, it has a tendency to get less... monstrous. Dragons - which at least in Western mythology were once giant, winged, fire-breathing lizards that burned villages and were slain by knights - first got more intelligent, then more likely to be a \"not really a monster\" subversion, until, in the modern era, stuff like Dragonheart and Pete's Dragon are nothing to bat an eye at. Similarly, orcs - who were invented for The Lord of the Rings to be bred evil (and mostly stupid) often appear as \"noble savages\" after just eighty years.\nThere are also cases where said monster is modified in order to appeal to younger demographics (and otakus) by making him (or, for the latter, her) more cute, huggable, and so forth.\nIn short, this trope is Villain Decay on the species level - what happens when Our Monsters Are Different turns the exception into the rule.\nSee also Cute Monster Girl, You Sexy Beast, Lovecraft Lite, Disneyfication. Friendly Neighbourhood Vampire is a subtrope of this. Not to be confused with the plot of Despicable Me.\n"}
{"Multiverse": "Some settings refer to not just one other dimension, one other universe, or one other timeline, but to a whole set of other dimensions, universes, planes of existence, realities, timelines, and the like. A collection of distinct universes exists, said universes often being interconnected in a way that allows characters to travel to and from them. It might be as a tourist who just goes to look and tries not to change anything, or as a participant who goes in and interacts with the people in the other universe.\nThe multiverse can encompass an infinite number of possible and impossible \"moments\", some of these linked by tidy and coherent timelines. But there may also be an equal or even greater number of incoherent, looped, knotted, or unconnected timeless moments that remain unchanging for all eternity.\nTimelines need not progress forward, or even backward, but also what appears to be sideways through disjointed and unrelated frames of reference. The multiverse may have no apparent ultimate purpose or reason for existence, other than it just is.\nSelecting a specific dimensional or timeline destination in the multiverse may be difficult for a traveler. To make sense of this, they may have some relative sense of locality starting from their \"home\" dimension or timeline, traveling \"outward\" into the gradually diverging alternate realities around their own. The dimensional expanse is potentially limitless, while the traveler's lifetime and ability to explore and survive them is not.\nThe method of multiverse travel can be physical or nonphysical. A nonphysical multiverse traveler may be disembodied as a spectator, but may also be able to enter the body of beings to experience what they are experiencing, or to assume direct control. A physical multiverse traveler has additional problems of survival to deal with, such as breathable air, correct temperature, pressure, and gravity, plus also unknowns such as foreign microorganisms. And at the same time a physical dimensional traveler can unintentionally affect the worlds they visit, with their own viruses or bacteria, and not just by what they say or do.\nThe multiverse permits changing of timelines in a personal sense. Going back in time to change something simply causes the travelers to experience an altered timeline going forward from that change. The original timeline also still exists and progresses normally, at the moment they left.\nDamage to timelines in the multiverse by a time traveler can be impossible, since all forms of damage and all timelines where it occurs may already exist but are simply not experienced, because the differing timelines can converge and reuse the same spatial moments of existence without themselves intersecting.\nThe multiverse can also solve the problem of free will vs predestination. It is possible that the multiverse is static and unchanging. All things that can ever exist already exist somewhere within it. But because there are a possibly infinite number of timelines converging and diverging from every moment into an equally huge number of alternate realities, predestination becomes irrelevant since normally only one of these timelines is experientially traversable.\nThe definition of the self and the individual becomes vague, because there can be an equally infinite number of \"selves of me\" all traversing the timelines simultaneously. Only a privileged few of these may gain the ability to break free of the restrictions and cross between timelines or experience other timelines completely unrelated to their own.\nThe need to achieve anything and the ability to create anything new becomes irrelevant if the ability to easily traverse the infinitely varied timelines of the multiverse becomes possible. One can simply choose to experience a point in a timeline where the achievements have already occurred, or the desired thing was already created and carried out to its fullest form.\nMorality becomes a question of what timelines and time periods that a multiverse voyager allows themselves to experience and be aware of, because the worst atrocities imaginable already exist in every possible form and can not be prevented. One can only choose to experience the kinder, gentler timelines, while recognizing the others exist and actively choosing to not experience them.\nAt the same time, a multiverse voyager can choose to experience atrocious timelines in the multiverse, knowing that they are only responsible for choosing to be aware of them, and not for actually causing any of the events of the timeline, because the events that will occur in those timelines are already fixed and can not be changed. Any attempt at change of the events of a timeline simply results in selection of one of the many diverging paths away from it, which also already exist in every possible form.\nDreaming may involve experiencing incoherent snippets of alternate timelines in the multiverse, as a form of \"taking a break\" from main normal timeline while sleeping. Lucid dreamers, meditators, and astral travelers may also gain more direct control over these alternate timeline experiences, to experience them more vividly or coherently.\nDimensional Travelers can move between universes and explore the Multiverse. While it is possible they don't have a choice in their destination, sometimes they do. There are a wide variety of Interdimensional Travel Devices available but the most common are gates or magic.\nIn most fantasy settings, the other worlds are often referred to as \"planes of existence\", and are alternate dimensions. In most science fiction settings, the other worlds are often entire parallel universes or alternate timelines.\nOn some occasions it's the way for a creator to tie several different works via Canon Welding, or to justify a Crossover.\nThis provides all sorts of interesting ideas for things you can do, for good or bad. If it involves trans-universe Sex Tourism, you have Your Universe or Mine? (or Screw Yourself sometimes). However, beware Evil Twin, and similar beings.\nSometimes, the Multiverse is protected by a Guardian of the Multiverse. The Multiversal Conqueror, on the other hand, wants to conquer or destroy it.\nIt is not the same thing as Alternate Continuity - which refers to a separate universe which a work has (but that might equally have its own Multiverse within its Continuity), but it makes for a handy way to link them if the writers are so inclined.\nSee also Bizarro Universe, Another Dimension and Alternate Universe. Compare Rubber-Band History. If one universe acts as a Cosmic Keystone that the others are based on, that's The Earth-Prime Theory.\nFor works set in the same series franchise, see The 'Verse and Intra-Franchise Crossover.\n"}
{"AwfulBritishSexComedy": "During The '70s, when sex and nudity in mainstream films were at their height and the boundary between soft-core porn and mainstream was blurred, the UK film industry's main product, aside from big-screen Brit Com adaptations, consisted of low-budget comedies with sexual themes featuring a great deal of nudity and slapstick. Modern viewers almost universally agree that these were flat-out awful films, but some enjoy them anyway.\nMost famous was the Confessions from a Holiday Camp, four films entitled Confessions... of a Window Cleaner, of a Driving Instructor, of a Pop Performer and from a Holiday Camp, all of which followed the misadventures of \"lovable\" loser Timmy Lea (to quote the theme tune from the first episode \"You're really not a loser, you just find it hard to win\") as he bungles his way through a series of jobs set up for him by his brother-in-law, Sid Noggett, who happened to be played by the future father-in-law of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. At every turn, Sid and Timmy attempt to have sex with every young woman they meet, often successfully. Subplots include Sid's stormy marriage and Timmy's Dad's habit of stealing things from the lost property office where he works.\nOther similar films were made at about the same time, including the derivative \"Adventures\" series, one episode of which, Adventures of a Taxi Driver is said to have out-performed Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver at the British box office; if true, this says a horrible thing about British culture in the '70s note\u00a0The page image, Confessions of a Window Cleaner notoriously knocked Disney classic The Aristocats off the number one spot of the most popular film of 1974. Established comedy series, such as Carry On, also converged with this type of film during The '70s.\nAll the films of this type were cheap, cheerful and cheesy. They also showed considerably more flesh and considerably less morality than modern sex comedies. For example, remember how, at the end of American Pie 2, our hero turns down the beautiful foreign student who has already got her tits out and runs off after the band geek whom he has just realized he really loves? Timmy Lea would have shagged the foreign girl, then said, \"Ta very much, love. Cheerio!\" and then ran off after the band geek. And the shag would have been on camera.\nA notable TV example of this genre is The Benny Hill Show, a long-running Britcom that ran for 20 seriesnote\u00a0The British telly equivalent of a show's TV season; for example, Series 1 would be the British equivalent of Season 1, etc. from 1969 to 1989, which is notable for two things: Benny Hill's slapstick antics, which would usually result in a woman hitting him even when contact was accidental, and getting Chased Off into the Sunset with such a closing sequence involving \"Yakety Sax\", the wacky, fast-paced closing theme played by Boots Randolph on the saxophone.\n"}
{"MatchmakerQuest": "An NPC (or three) are down on their luck in the love department, and can't seem to get that special someone to notice them. They're so desperate and mopey and (a)pathetically resigned to their doomed loveless future that they will spill their guts about these troubles to the first heavily-armed stranger to cross their paths (That means you). Rather than find a solution themselves, they will ask you to do something for them, usually involving a Fetch Quest for some engagement gift, Impossible Task, or plain old bling to impress their potential partner. Other times, it suffices for you to use your prodigious dialogue screen channeled charisma to convince their intended to love them back. Occasionally, the match is already made and the quest centers on solving some other difficulty, like getting the parents to let them marry, gathering wedding materials, a dowry*\u00a0which will hopefully not consist of 20 Bear Asses, or helping them set up a life for themselves.\nDepending on the game, you may find yourself in this situation so often you practically become The Matchmaker and end up fixing everyone's love life. If you're lucky, the game developers won't forget to give the Player Character his/her own Romance Sidequest. Of course, some developers like to play with this trope and include options for you to sabotage this burgeoning love or outright steal them from the quest giver.\nThe Match Maker Quest is usually a necessary middle link in a Chain of Deals, and almost always rewards you by dropping some unique love themed loot. Hey, who cares if the +5 Vorpal Sword is pink and fills the air with Heart Symbols? Headless bodies won't complain! Isn't it amazing how RPG's manage to make even love reward you with implements of violence?\nSee also the closely related, more generalised trope Sidequest Sidestory.\n"}
{"HelpingWouldBeKillStealing": "You are in trouble. Big trouble. It is painful \u2014 emotionally, physically, or both. You could come to harm, maybe you could even get killed.\nThere is this person. He has power, he is able to help you. And it's not like he's too busy to be able to spend the time on you.\nBut he cares about you and wishes you well. And that's why he won't help you. Because he thinks that you need the experience. Or self-confidence. Or reputation. Because he thinks that solving your problems for you would be bad for your growth. Or that showing doubts in your ability would be impolite. And so, you are on your own.\nAlthough this trope is about passively letting bad things happen rather than actively setting them up, it can apply to a Stealth Mentor or other Trickster Mentor that has set things in motion and then remain in the background while reminding himself that he mustn't step in. Might become a very reluctant Deus ex Machina that is really sorry he gave the Main Characters that vital information instead of letting them find it themselves, or regrets that he removed That One Obstacle. One of the main tools of the Sink-or-Swim Mentor.\nThe trope is named after a common derogatory epithet in MMORPGs.\nCompare This Is Something He's Got to Do Himself, where something is left to The Hero because he has an emotional stake in it.\nContrast Kill Steal and Unwanted Assistance. Inverted trope of The Evils of Free Will.\n"}
{"TwentyBearAsses": "A type of Fetch Quest that involves going around killing enemies and collecting a certain amount of a specific item that these enemies randomly drop. They are most common in MMORPGs. The common hypothetical example involves a woodsman NPC asking the Player Character to deliver 20 sections of bear to him.\nThis sort of quest can draw attention to the inherent Fridge Logic of Random Drops, such as when the drop in question is a vital body part that all monster corpses should have, like a liver, feet, skin, or a head. A flimsy justification is that the body part may have been compromised during the fight. Turns out only pristine bear asses will do, even when the woodsman just wants twenty bears dead and doesn't actually want to make anything out of the asses. That is one picky woodsman. How you kill the bear rarely affects the odds of its ass being ruined, either, so Clerics whose attacks are spiritual or psychic rather than physical are not immune to this trope, while attacks that reduce the target to Ludicrous Gibs or burn it to a crisp don't reduce the odds of finding the correct part.\nThis type of quest can frequently not fit in thematically with a story, and could be arbitrarily inserted into any location the player is at (Lava Bears, Mist Bears, Greater Bears, Hellbears...) as long as there's a bear with the perfect ass required to produce some kind of magic spell or... whatever. It may not make sense for the player characters to accept them, and, in the worst case, may be a form of Fake Longevity comparable to a Fetch Quest.\nFrequently overlaps, either in the same quest or same area, with Mass Monster Slaughter Sidequest. Compare Cash Gate, which requires you to collect something useful to proceed, usually money.\nIf a webcomic or something else parodies MMORPGs, expect to see this trope parodied every time.\nNot to be confused with Cheek Copy, which could result in 20 bare asses, nor does it involve Ass Shove.\n"}
{"ExcitedTitleTwoPartEpisodeName": "Anime episode titles, especially for shounen series, tend to be two exclaiming sentences (sentence fragments are also common). The sentences are typically unusually descriptive by Western standards (but see In Which a Trope Is Described), and can reveal crucial plot details or work as an out and out summary of the episode. Generally, the format is a summary of the episode with exclamation points, followed by a comment on the episode that sounds as if it was something one of the main cast would say.\nIn dubbing, these are sometimes changed to something else entirely, usually a pun of some sort.\nIf Western fiction used the same style of titling, we'd probably have \"Battle in the Cloud City! Luke's Father Revealed!\" in place of The Empire Strikes Back. Bonus points if the title does all the revealing on its own.\nA specific form of Idiosyncratic Episode Naming.

{"LastSecondShowoff": "When a character in a work waits to perform a task because they know they can get it done. They can afford to procrastinate because they know they have the ability to get it done within the short time frame that remains.\nThe kind of work can be anything; it can be as simple as a race, but it can also be paperwork, lifting jobs, etc. as long as they're certain they're able to finish them quickly.\nThe result: they may succeed, proving their abilities, or they may fail, leading to An Aesop about not waiting until the last minute.\nCodified by the Hare of the tale of The Tortoise and The Hare; he chooses to laze in the race against the slow Tortoise because he's certain that he can win, only to lose instead. See below.\n"}
{"StopHavingFunGuy": "The gamer equivalent of the Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy. He's a Hard Core gamer, plays in all tournaments, and knows everything about how to play. He knows all the secret moves (even the glitches), the most effective strategies, and the quickest ways to completely destroy his opponent. He's completely \"above\" the mantra of casual play: He doesn't play just for fun, he plays to win. He's good, and he knows it. There's nothing wrong with that.\nHowever, he's also extremely arrogant. He's completely intolerant of play styles other than his own. If you challenge his beliefs, he'll automatically call you a Noob, a Scrub, or something similar. As far as he's concerned if you don't play like him you have only your inferior skills to blame, because obviously you would if you could.\nYep, that's right, he's the exact opposite of the Scrub...but just as annoying.\nThis kind of player takes the \"pro\" mentality to an annoying extreme, generally giving other tournament players a bad name (while his counterpart, the Scrub, takes the casual mentality to an annoying extreme and generally gives other casual players a bad name). In the real world, there's room for both, and game companies generally try to put something in their games for both Player Archetypes.\nIn the end, what makes a \"Stop Having Fun\" Guy isn't the rule-setting, it's the attitude. While regular competitive/tournament players simply like playing to win, the \"Stop Having Fun\" Guy believes that this is the only right way to play the game.\nThe SHFG is a specific subspecies of Fan Haters, who dislike/condescend to \"casual\" gamers who don't play the same way they do. It also overlaps with Complacent Gaming Syndrome, where the players use only one or two characters/strategies/levels to make winning easier.\nSee also: Scrub, Serious Business, Fan Dumb and Internet Backdraft. The larval form of the SHFG is the Munchkin. See It's Easy, So It Sucks! for the mentality that sometimes results from the single-player form of this.\n"}
{"PlantHair": "Whenever Plant People show up, they are almost guaranteed to have Plant Hair.\nPlant Hair is when a character, usually a plant, has leaves, vines, flowers, and other foliage-related paraphernalia instead of hair.\nThis can be a Justified Trope because having leaves on top of your head makes them closer to the sun, so photosynthesis is easier. Although most of the time it just looks good. That doesn't excuse Humans with Plant Hair, when the Plant People look exactly like humans, except for their Plant Hair.\nNote that the character in question doesn't have to be a plant. They just have to have foliage-related stuff instead of hair.\nCompare Robot Hair and Alien Hair. See also Plant Person, Plant Aliens, and Planimal, who probably have this. Sometimes occurs in Weird Beard form.\n"}
{"Yukionna": "Literally meaning \"snow woman\", Yuki-onna appear as beautiful women in snowy, cold, or mountainous regions. They're typically depicted as pale women with long, black or (particularly in modern depictions) blue hair that wear kimonos (however, some traditional depictions also show them being nude). Yuki-onna are the spirits of women who died during snow storms.\nLike all mythological creatures, Yuki-onna have many different interpretations. Some are benevolent while others are malicious. Some Yuki-onna are essentially normal women who live in snowy areas, while others have specific powers. These powers can include turning into mist when scared, ice or snow powers, and the ability to hover over snow as to not leave footprints.\nWhether Yuki-onna simply like cold climates, are cursed to live in cold climates, or literally can't survive outside of cold climates depends on the incarnation. Some incarnations sleep with lone travelers to steal valuable body warmth, others will simply make them get lost during their travels in order to freeze to death, yet others will kill travelers by tricking them into touching them or a baby they hold in their hands. More benevolent Yuki-onna will either lead the victims to safety and then sleep with them (or just lead them to safety), or simply leave them alone; the more wicked ones will lead them astray to begin with, kill them with the methods described above, or use them. Some evil Yuki-onna have been described as letting their victims go if they are too young or too attractive.\nTraditionally, Yuki-onna are just average women however within the past several decades it's become commonplace to see them depicted as princesses. The popularity of Queen Oyuki from Urusei Yatsura and the Winter Royal Lady trope (especially the White Witch from The Chronicles of Narnia) are likely the reasons for this.\nIf a Yuki-onna isn't just outright called \"Yuki-onna\", she will usually have a snow themed name (with \"Yuki\" being the most generic).\nTheir beautiful designs and dark stories have caused Yuki-onna to become one of the most popular yokai out there, to the degree where they even appear in works made outside of Japan.\nSub-Trope to youkai. Compare to Stringy-Haired Ghost Girl, a similar trope often seen in Japanese media.\n"}
{"GiveMeYourInventoryItem": "NPCs are demanding people. They will ask you to donate money, give you Pop Quizzes about what you've done on your quest, send you off on annoying sidequests, make you run all the way around the world for that useless puzzle item or trading game item... and the hero will, of course, be obliged to do as the NPC says, because, well, good guys like you are just into philanthropy like that (not to mention the fact that it's necessary for your quest half of the time.)\nSometimes, though, an NPC will go so far as to demand that you hand over one or more of a useful and valuable item from your inventory. These aren't puzzle items whose only existence in life is to appease them. Rather, they're items that you bought with your own hard-earned gold and actually intended to use on yourself. Surprise, now you're going to have to buy another one.\nWhen you hear the NPC say, \"I need your life potion to heal my daughter\" or \"I need some bombs to blow up this wall,\" you know that the item is going to vanish from your inventory and you're never going to see it again. At least giving the item to the guy will make him happy enough to let you pass, or maybe give you that useless puzzle item you need to give to the king of some other country...\nThis often results in an the player getting something much better in return, sometimes later in the game, basically making it an unspoken Aesop about giving stuff to people in need.\n"}
{"NecktieHeadband": "Exactly What It Says on the Tin: someone wearing a necktie around the head as an improvised Martial Arts Headband.\nA trope often associated with salarymen and other corporate types whose business clothes come with a necktie. Sometimes they get overenthusiastic during an after-work party, or they get involved in Serious Business that justifies dropping the Dress Code.\nIn real life, most specifically in the hard drinking context, this custom comes from a drunken guy's ostensibly failed attempt to take off his necktie, which remains wrapped around his head for the rest of the party after they forget the matter or quit trying due to alcohol-numb fingers.\nSister Trope to Lampshade Wearing.\nAdvertising\nAnime & Manga\nLive-Action TV\nVideogame\nWeb Comic\nWeb Video\nWestern Animation\nReal Life\n"}
{"YouWakeUpOnABeach": "Every character has to start at the bottom, and then work their way to the top over the course of the story. Sometimes, though, an author will want to take that to its logical conclusion and start the story with the character waking up marooned on a beach with literally nothing except the clothes on their back and whatever was in their pockets. Or even no clothes at all.\nThis type of beginning gives the author an easy starting point for his story, because it boils everything down to absolute basics and comes standard with a predefined list of relatively simple questions for the author to answer; among them is usually \"How did we end up here to begin with?\", a good way to get the audience immediately vested into the story. Which questions he chooses to answer and what answers he gives add more detail to the scene and flesh it out into whatever story the author wishes to tell.\nIn video games, a beach is an ideal tutorial area for new players, since the critters are generally weak and easy to kill and the loot is basic enough for the player to learn how the game's inventory systems work before the game leads them inland to their first real adventures.\nNote that this is when the main story of a work starts with a character waking up on a beach, regardless of where the plot goes afterward. This is not the same as a Robinsonade, though it can become one if the character's survival on the beach remains the focus of the plot. Also note that some works might include a brief prologue or flashback before the character actually wakes up. This is fine, so long as the work's main plot opens on this trope.\nCompare and contrast You Wake Up in a Room, where the character is locked in a room. Contrast Tropical Epilogue, where the story ends with the character on the beach.\n"}

{"DontBeRidiculous": "\"... dogs come from the Moon, not the Sun!\"\nAlice says something ridiculous. Bob responds with this Stock Phrase (or some close relative), then explains why Alice's statement is ridiculous. Of course, Bob's justification is either as absurd, more absurd, or otherwise not a rebuttal one would normally make to the original statement.\nOften, Bob is The Ditz, a Cloudcuckoolander, or a Bunny-Ears Lawyer. Less often, Alice is likewise one of those characters.\nA common variant is that Alice's original statement was an attempt to guess what Bob is planning or doing. (\"So you're going to just storm the castle?\" \"Don't be absurd. I'm going to storm the castle carrying this marionette. Sheesh.\")\nNot quite the same as the usage of the phrase by Funny Foreigner Balki Bartokomous in the sitcom Perfect Strangers.

{"TheDarkWorld": "(For the proper experience, run the music from this video as you venture below.)\nDrive down the old highway at midnight, walk through an ancient shrine to the Elder Gods, or \"sleep off\" a bad trip from a strange drug that's darker than oil... and you'll end up in a parallel world made of your worst nightmares. This is the Dark World.\nIt is a twisted fun-house mirror version of our own world, filled with the dilapidated and distorted reflections of normal buildings, decayed into Sinister Subways and Abandoned Hospitals. The changes can even extend to the layout of the city or area, the geography will turn malevolent as it gets huge gaping holes, fences, or other barriers added \u2014 or removed. The dimensions don't have to add up the way you learned in geometry class.\nIts inhabitants will likely be similarly warped, if not monsters or unfathomable spirits outright. If the real world is also populated with monsters, expect the former to be tougher. Perhaps they feel at home in the dark? It's not always literally darker, but often is. It might not necessarily be evil, but often is. The nature of the Dark World might never be revealed, but could very well be entirely \"natural\", or outright hellish.\nEntering the Dark World can be distressingly easy: drive to a little old town, walk into a Haunted Castle, activate a strange device, Swirly Energy Thingy, crawl through a hole in your bathroom or go into a Convenient Coma near a psychically charged place. The last one tends to be freakiest because whatever Nightmare Fuel the darkness throws at you will most likely be reinforced by your own mind. Returning to the \"real\" world is always harder; even if you have control over your transitions between the worlds, your objective will often be in the more dangerous one - and even if you walk away, the Darkness might just follow you home...\nThe most creepy part of this trope is how mundane it is. It is really difficult to imagine oneself in an obviously Eldritch Location, but it's easy to imagine that you got lost in your home town and ended up in some district that really gives you chills.\nSee also Mirror World and Spirit World, which may overlap at times. Frequently used as the horror genre form of Environmental Symbolism, the Dark World shares some qualities with, but is distinct from, Time Travel and Another Dimension. If you travel from your hometown to a Bad Future where it's in ruins, that's Time Travel. If you travel from your hometown to a fantasy forest, that's Another Dimension. But if you travel from your hometown to a dark, twisted parody of your hometown filled with monsters... congratulations, enjoy your stay in the Dark World.\nIf you merely go back to your hometown when it's dark, even if the town's been infested by The Undead, then you're merely in a Remixed Level.note\u00a0Unless your town got zapped into a Dark World, in which case, good luck.\nA Dark World is usually a type of Alternate World Map, if used as a world map.\nA Sub-Trope of Shadowland.\n"}
{"MoveInTheFrozenTime": "This is about someone, or something (other than the user, or their bullets), that doesn't get frozen in time - or at least not slowed in time - when a time-stop/slow effect occurs.

This is not always a simple matter of just being immune though, sometimes it's part of Applied Phlebotinum, sheer willpower, or some sort of dumb luck of having something else interfere with the effect.\nNote that this is specifically when moving while time is frozen is a separate power from freezing time itself. Otherwise it's simply Required Secondary Powers for Time Stands Still, and thus belongs on that page.\n"}
{"ComatoseCanary": "Someone's lying in a hospital, badly hurt, outright unconscious, in a Convenient Coma or otherwise incapable of talking, hooked up to a heart rate monitor. The bad cop is in need of information, so they walk up and speak unpleasantness. Cue the ECG spiking to indicate that it's working. The positive variant is also seen, with a person apparently unconscious suddenly reacting to someone talking. Again, the ECG will act as the mood ring. Variations include squeezing the hand and so on.\nNot to be confused with somebody suffering from the Locked-in Syndrome, which might or might not be able to communicate, and frequently results in a Disability Superpower.\n"}

In fiction it is sometimes possible for other creatures, even humans in some cases, to do this as well.\nSubtrope of Gender Bender. May involve Bizarre Alien Sexes. Usually a part of any in story in which Shapeshifters Do It for a Change.\n"}
{"TheDeathOfDeath": "The Grim Reaper is always considered to be the embodiment of death. As such, it only makes sense that such a being would be considered immortal and unable to actually die. Can't die if you are death itself.\nNot so much the case here. If this trope is in play, then death is just as capable of dying as everybody else. In some cases, the grim reaper getting killed off ends up coming with some serious consequences. In other cases, death is simply reborn and continues his business. If somebody is responsible for the reaper dying, they might be forced into taking up the role.\nCompare to Death Takes a Holiday, wherein Death is no longer doing his job. See also Kill the God. If a mere mortal manages to take down the big guy, see Did You Just Punch Out Cthulhu?\nSpoilers will not be marked due to this being a Death Trope.\n"}
{"MadDictatorsHandsomeSon": "A Mad Scientist has only one child \u2014 a beautiful but innocent girl in her late teens or early twenties, who loves her father dearly, and whom he has kept cloistered away from the world. Sometimes she has some small doubts about his goals or methods.\nWhen the question of how a shriveled ugly man has a gorgeous daughter comes up, the response is either that she looks like her mother, or that the father did look as attractive as his daughter when he was younger.\nWhen the Mad Scientist is a good guy, the Daughter is not nearly so cloistered, although she is still a prime candidate as a love interest. Sometimes she ends up The Chick or The Smart Girl in a Five-Man Band when a team relies on the Scientist for their Phlebotinum. This latter version is more common nowadays.\nThis trope is Older Than Feudalism, Medea \u2014 and many Fairy Tale heroines \u2014 being a recognizable form of it, even if it's the mad wizard's beautiful daughter.\nOften overlaps with The Ugly Guy's Hot Daughter. May overlap with Daddy's Little Villain. Might also end up being a Perky Female Minion or Dark Action Girl, if she frequently helps her father in his work.\n"}
{"CharacterizationTags": "An informal, ad hoc system of tagging that has spontaneously evolved over the years within the greater Fanfic community.\nThese tags are concatenated and prepended to a character name, separated by exclamation marks: for example, Angry!Uber!Harry.\nCommon tags include:\nFanfic communities will often have tags specific to their fandoms that they use to describe tropes that occur with some regularity (Slytherin!Harry, Future!Hiro, or Vamp!Willow, for example).\nThe title of a given Fan Verse, or an abbreviation thereof, can also be used to indicate the version of a character from that setting, particularly when there have been major changes to them: UF!Utena, SME!Jadeite.\nBecause this kind of tagging is ad hoc and in no way formalized, it's common to see unusual and/or idiosyncratic tags that indicate some truly wild variants (like, for example, thanks to a \"Freaky Friday\" Flip), such as Cyborg!Xander or Amberite!Xena.\nThe practice is starting to seep out from fanfiction, though, and can also be used when talking about similar things in the source material, such as, for example, Future!Hiro, Vamp!Willow, or Brainwashed!Undead!Starscream (Energon!Starscream for short). It's also used in a more tongue-in-cheek manner to categorize examples of the Mary Sue in a quick, concise form.\nIt can also be used to identify a specific version of a character or work when it had been done by different people and/or in different media since those can vary wildly from the source material. Sometimes this uses the name of the specific author or simply the form of the work (Manga!Pride, Anime!Greed, Leroux!Erik, or Movie!Phantom)\nThese tags are also occasionally used when dealing with customizable characters in computer games. In addition, tags like this are used in spreadsheet programs to denote what sheet the cell in question is on if it's not on the same sheet as the cell you're typing in. Bang paths were used in early e-mail to specify a UUCP route to a given user, and they're still part of the return path in Usenet.\n"}
{"PrivateInvestigator": "A seeker character frequently used in Detective Drama.\nA professional detective not directly affiliated with a police department in any official sense (although many will have contacts in the department, and it's not uncommon for members of this profession to have been either police officers or previously worked in law-enforcement, as many of the skill sets overlap), a Private Detective takes on cases that private citizens bring to them - however, whilst they aren't supposed to investigate crimes (which are official matters for the police, who often look dimly upon private detectives sticking their noses in - both in fiction and in real life), they usually find themselves knee-deep in murders, robberies and kidnappings by the end of the story. They may be doing this because the Police are Useless and/or unconcerned about solving the case, meaning our detective is the only person who is actually willing or capable of solving it. However, this is often justified (especially in classical Film Noir) by the detective starting off with a seemingly simple case, such as finding out if a woman's husband is committing adultery or investigating the disappearance of a man who vanished twelve years ago in order to resolve a debt he had with a wealthy businessman, only for things to spiral out of control to the point that the only way for the detective to get out is to solve the case.\nAlthough it's more common for a Private Detective these days to be treated as just one step away from the Amateur Sleuth (or often, particularly if seen from the point of view of the police, as rather sleazy bottom-feeders usually involved in some kind of criminal activity and frequently ex-cops kicked off the force for some kind of corruption), the classic Archetype of the Private Detective - and the one that has generally stuck in the mind of people when they think of the profession - is either the Great Detective or the Hardboiled Detective. In Real Life, the Private Detective is often viewed as a Punch-Clock Villain for his or her use of Sinister Surveillance. The fact that they are officially licensed to go on a Stalking Mission to track whoever they are hired to investigate (often for non-criminal activity like adultery) puts them firmly in the camp of Sociopathic Hero, or a Psycho for Hire with no respect for other individuals' privacy, depending on who you ask. In Real Life, some private investigators may also function as a Bounty Hunter, as the two professions are incredibly similar (although a Bounty Hunter will usually confront the individual he or she is tracking directly - a Private Investigator typically will not if he or she can help it).\nWhile the comparison with the Amateur Sleuth is common, in many ways the stories work the opposite ways. The Amateur Sleuth, such as Miss Marple, tend to cozy locked room mysteries, where everything starts complicated and uncertain, but slowly works its way down as a logic puzzle, with a tidy solution where the killer is unmasked. The Private Investigator tends to start simple, but as the investigation will unravel an ever more complicated plot, and the ending is rarely tidy. Minor Crime Reveals Major Plot is a common thread. The killer may be unmasked, but larger problems tend to stay unsolved.\nVampire Detective Series often feature one as a protagonist, though of the immortal variant; while the Occult Detective uses magic.\n"}
{"InactionSequence": "A fair bit of anime is adapted from manga, its print cousin. There are good things and bad things about this.\nThe trouble is that the narrative style of manga derives from literature, where the amount of space you spend on something is proportional to how important it is, while the narrative style of anime derives from film, where the amount of time you spend on something is (even after all the tricks of time compression and such are considered) at least roughly proportional to how long things actually take.\nSo you start out with, say, a 30 page comic book, and you want to turn it into a 30 minute show. This can be a problem if there's a fight scene: a comic book might devote an entire issue to a single fight, which only takes up about five minutes on-screen. Translating a monthly publication to a weekly series makes matters even worse. And it's a dangerous gamble when shows get ahead of the source material.\nIn addition, the anime industry works on a hurried schedule, with staffs and budgets small enough to make American producers cringe. They are expected to turn popular manga into long running series, and one of the biggest costs in both time and money comes from animating dynamic action sequences.\nAs a result, characters in anime derived from manga tend to talk a lot.\nA whole lot.\nAt totally inappropriate times.\nOften, you'll have heroes spend entire episodes taunting each other mid-battle, explaining their last move in excruciating detail, explaining their next move in even more excruciating detail, calling their attacks, building up their Battle Aura, gathering their composure for the next attack, adopting a silly pose, reflecting on all the things they stand to lose if they don't win this one, telling their life stories, or just being randomly philosophical.\nThis is a very distinctive anime variety of Padding. See also Overtook the Manga, Sounding It Out, Talking Is a Free Action. Talk to the Fist is when someone whacks or shoots a character in the middle of delivering one of these speeches. See Mid-Battle Tea Break for a break in the action for the sake of comedy, rather than stalling.\n"}
{"PowersViaPossession": "A Stock Superpowers trope. The character gets superpowers by allowing themselves to be possessed or by channeling spirits (usually ghosts) through them, by which they can access the skills and abilities the ghosts had in life or new powers that the ghost possesses by dint of, well, being a ghost such as unearthly wailing, freezing touch, moving things around like a poltergeist.\nOf course, this requires the ability to see and talk to the ghosts in the first place.\nMay end up with the character possessing such powers referred to as being a medium, channeler, shaman, or witch doctor.\nSee Also: Demonic Possession, Heroic Host, Powers as Programs, Our Ghosts Are Different, Willing Channeler and Possession Burnout.\n"}
{"GoodVersusEvil": "Good versus Evil. White hat versus black hat. The shining knight of light and destiny with flowing cape versus the dark mustache-twirling, card-carrying force of pure malevolence. The Republic, The Alliance, The Federation and/or La R\u00e9sistance, fighting for freedom and happiness, helping the helpless, and running soup kitchens, versus the Evil Empire of oppression and tyranny run by The Legions of Hell, greedy corporate scumbags, and an Evil Overlord with a Deadly Decadent Court. The most basic form of fictional morality, Black And White Morality deals with the battle between pure good and absolute evil.\nThis can come in a variety of forms:\nStories using this trope usually have a Hero Protagonist and a Villain Antagonist, though this is not always the case. They're also where you're most likely to find Beauty Equals Goodness, although there are stories with black and white morality where appearance doesn't reflect morality.\nWhile it shows up in stories of all kinds, Black And White Morality seems to occur frequently in media marketed for kids. Many stories that use Black And White Morality tend to lean towards the idealistic end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, but this doesn't necessarily have to be the case - in a more cynical Crapsack World, there is more black than white, but the white can at least take a sour form. Works that use both Adaptational Villainy and Adaptational Heroism, or Historical Villain Upgrade and Historical Hero Upgrade for different characters are also deliberately employing this trope to make the moral conflict simpler. Of course, usage of Black and White morality in stories won't always end up sparkling white: this moral alignment is often associated with clich\u00e9d writing and propaganda.\nOf course, the prevalence of this moral system may lead to the belief that Good Is Boring. Thus, the aforementioned grey spots in a setting like this are a common Ensemble Dark Horse. Badass Decay occurs when the dark horse is whitewashed to conform to the prevailing system.\nCompare Grey and Gray Morality, Black and Gray Morality, White and Grey Morality, and Morality Kitchen Sink. Also see Shades of Conflict and Graying Morality. See Black and White Insanity when this sort of thinking by characters is presented as a sign of mental instability in the story.\nPlease note even in a world where the moral lines are sharply drawn, there may still be characters or organizations that are presented as being 'grey'. A general rule of thumb as to whether or not black-and-white morality is present is that the heroes are almost always considered to be in the right, while the villains are always 'wrong'. Of course, the audience might disagree with the author's moral compass. Moral Dissonance occurs when a character with a black-and-white moral system is unaware that they're not always following their own values well (all-too-possible in Real Life).\nIf general attitudes on issues addressed change and/or the story is introduced to a very different culture, it may be viewed as Grey and Gray Morality, Black and Gray Morality, White and Grey Morality or Blue and Orange Morality.\n"}
{"BadAssArmy": "This is where the Badass Crew is taken to the next logical step and turned into an entire army. The Badass Army is made of 100% badasses and there is absolutely nothing that can stop them short of overwhelming numbers or an even more badass Badass Army. There is not a single soldier who can not hold their own in a fight. They are likely to be super soldiers and have a high likelihood to have been raised in The Spartan Way. They will not use Hollywood Tactics, like amateurs.\nCount on them to boast many a Colonel Badass, and many more Sergeant Rocks. Almost always commanded by one or several Four Star Badasses.\nThe polar opposite of Red Shirt Army. A sub-trope of this, where an especially Badass Army is sealed in the can, is the Sealed Army in a Can. Proud Warrior Race Guy is another variant where a guy is from a culture that makes an unusually big deal about trying to be this. Usually an Elite Army. Compare Humans Are Warriors, where having a Badass Army is humanity's hat, and with Men of Sherwood, a smaller scale support crew. Semper Fi is similar, but they are quick to inform you that they are not an army, regardless of the infantry, tanks, artillery, and attack helicopters that they use.\n"}
{"AwesomeDearBoy": "Some actors hate their past gigs because they seriously misjudged the quality at the time, only did them for the paycheck, or were required by contract to do so.\nBut some did the movie because they got to be vampires or superheroes, walk away from explosions in trenchcoats, ride motorcycles and fly through the air swinging a frickin' samurai sword. With Samuel L. Jackson. This trope is when an actor took the part based on its cool factor. They want it to be on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for their next job. Or, they'll be brushing over it on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9, but wrecking the set with fight scenes, explosions and over-acting sounded like great fun.\nContrast and compare with Money, Dear Boy, Doing It for the Art, and So My Kids Can Watch. Frequently overlaps with Promoted Fanboy. See also Vacation, Dear Boy, where the location is part of the awesomeness.\n"}
{"WorldofSnark": "In a World of Snark, every character is either a Deadpan Snarker (who falsely believes themself to be the Only Sane Man completely Surrounded by Idiots) or, rarely, a Ditz of any kind. These works usually lie far on the Cynical end of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism, and most of their humor comes from the characters' reactions to what they perceive as their crappy lives and constant snarking matches.\nThis is not to say that this world is incapable of having genuine, tender moments. Half the cast may be jerks, but the rest may be jerks with hearts of gold. If they're all jerks, it's a World of Jerkass.\nCompare Speech-Centric Work.\n"}
{"InferredSurvival": "In fiction, Death is relative (no, not that kind of relative!) and less than permanent at times. So just as survival is unlikely for some, death is unlikely for others.\nPerhaps the Anti-Hero was Left for Dead in a Heroic Sacrifice that no one could survive, but since they Never Found the Body, and they already had a penchant for Faking the Dead, their survival isn't so far fetched. Perhaps in the supposed Bolivian Army Ending there is a power, technology or ability that, while not explicitly mentioned, could save them. Perhaps the perennial Arch-Enemy has been bested in a final showdown and, refusing the hero's offer to save them, seemingly plummeted to their doom, but the audience knows how many times this has happened.\nAny time an author leaves the door ajar on a character's death to later bring them back plausibly if the plot requires it. Compare He's Just Hiding!. Often a result of Epileptic Trees and/or Fridge Logic, or even Word of God.\nSee also the Wild Mass Guessing Sorting Algorithm of Deadness for the odds of some characters returning.\n"}
{"GamblersFallacy": "Believing that dice/coins have memory, or that independent events will occur in \"streaks\". If a coin has just landed on heads four times in a row, surely it's much more likely to get tails this time, to even things out... or alternatively, heads is on a roll and will appear next time, too. See also Random Number God and Artistic Licence Statistics.\nPsychologically, this fallacy tends to come from the fact that the odds to replicate a pattern do go up cumulatively. The probability of rolling 20 on a d20 twice is 1/400, the same as any expected sequence of two numbers. The probability of rolling the first is 1/20, and the probability of rolling the second is also 1/20. The fallacy occurs when someone assumes that once they've rolled two 20s in a row, it's less likely than usual (< 1/20) that they'll get another 20. In reality, once they've rolled two 20s in a row, it's just as likely as ever (1/20) that they'll roll a 20 again. This also, most notably, works the other way around - if they've lost many bets in a row, they aren't any more likely to win the next bet. Psychologically, what you're doing is inventing desirable patterns that fit with the events you observe despite the patterns not really being there at all.\nA similar misinterpretation is that if an event has a probability of 1-in-n, then you are guaranteed a success if you make n attempts. As an exaggerated example, the probability of a \"heads\" on an unbiased coin is 1/2, therefore, flipping a coin twice is guaranteed to get at least one \"heads.\" This is not true.\nAnother factor is that many people confuse \"a number of independent events\" (where any of a number of permutations will do) with \"a series of independent events\" (where only one permutation will do). If we flip a coin twice, we have a 50% chance of getting heads and tails in some order (heads-tails and tails-heads; the other two possibilities are heads-heads and tails-tails). But if we specify that we want the series to be \"heads-tails\", the probability that that particular series will come up is only 25% \u2014 the outcome tails-heads no longer fits the criteria. (Of course, any series has the same chance of coming up. You have as much chance of flipping heads-tails as you do tails-heads, heads-heads, or tails-tails; namely, 25%.)\nAlso, stuff really does even out over time. Just not in the way some people might think. Say that you have flipped a coin and you have had 4 heads and 1 tails come up. Heads has come up 80% of the time. Now, you get the \"normal\" (more common) sequence, where 5 heads and 5 tails come up, bringing a total of 9 heads and 6 tails. You then have only 60% heads, so while this is a smaller number, it didn't exactly \"even out.\"\nTo explain the above in another way, flip a coin 10 times, and the chances that heads was flipped 4 times or more is 82.81%. Flip it 1000 times, and the chances heads was flipped 400 times or more is 99.99999999%. But even if it was less than 400, the next flip will still be 50/50: long-term odds predict the general trend of many results, not what will happen in a specific instance. This is also the reason why playing a high number of low-stakes games in Casinos increases the chances of the house making money; the house advantage only affects who wins a small percentage of the time, but this advantage \"evens out\" over the long haul. Unless you're a good card counter, taking advantage of free stuff, or just enjoy playing, you're more likely to be successful with a small number of high-stakes events.\nNote that Gambler's Fallacy applies only to systems that both have no memory, and are explicitly known to be fair. Drawing cards without replacement (read, deck now has \"memory\") does alter the probabilities of the next cards drawn, and if you do not explicitly know that the event being tested is fair, you can use things like n-heads-in-a-row to draw conclusions of bias in the system (see Non-examples and Theatre sections below).\nCompare Sunk Cost Fallacy.\n Anime & Manga\nFan Fiction\nLiterature:\nLive-Action TV\nNewspaper Comics\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWeb Animation\nWeb Comics\nWestern Animation\nReal Life\n Video Games\n"}
{"HometownHero": "Be it an action movie from North America, a graphic novel from Asia or a video game from Europe - not all stories from all countries are going to be set in the same places; some will be set in their creator's native home, but many others can just as well be set in Bulungi, or \u00dcberwald, or SPACE.\nHowever, there is one thing you can almost always count on happening:\nThese kinds of works are always going to feature some important character who represents the work's domestic country or culture, even if there is no particular in-story reason for them to be there. Whether said character is a fish-out-of-water Vanilla Protagonist following the Call to Adventure or just a mauve-shirted Right Man in the Wrong Place - the principle is identical.\nThe reason any foreign setting will feature a familiar spirit is so that there'll be someone that the author - or, more commonly, the intended Target Audience - will be able to hold on to and navigate by (either that or because the producers wouldn't trust them to care for the story if there were no fellow countrymen involved). Alternately, this could be a mere effect of budget restraints - not everyone can afford to include (decent) foreign parts, particularly not for leading characters.\nNeedless to say, this very often intersects with various other tropes of the same bent, such as, the White Male Lead, the Token White, the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant, the Vanilla Protagonist, the Standardized Leader, Lead You Can Relate To, America Won World War II and America Saves the Day, and But Not Too Foreign.\nMighty Whitey, Strange Cop in a Strange Land and Foreign Correspondent cover aspects of this trope, but are ultimately subtropes to the Homegrown Hero. Audience Surrogate and Write What You Know, in return, are Supertropes.\nIt should be noted that this often not only applies to the work's country of origin, but that of the audience that's primarily expected to be exposed to it, either because they are from that country/culture, or because it just happens to be very popular with them.\nOften crops up in both Sequels Going Foreign and Foreign Remakes, which more often than not recycle the plot in more exotic locations and give the story a 'translated' tinge respectively.\nContrast Token Minority, which does the exact opposite.\n"}
{"TaremeEyes": "A style in anime and manga of drawing eyes where they droop or sag at the corners. Typically, a Moe character will have those definitive, sympathy-magnet Puppy-Dog Eyes. It generally represents a kind, quiet, sad, fragile or otherwise soft person. In the Boys' Love Genre, it's a common (although not guaranteed) indicator of who's the Uke. Only really notable if there are more than a handful of characters that are drawn without them. Tareme are more prevalent in female and child characters because they appear soft and innocent, therefore feminine.\nThis does not mean that Tareme Eyes are Always Lawful Good Eyes. In Real Life, eyes visually take a downward droop when someone is looking down on you, and looking calm in a tense situation is an affirmatively badass, and/or insane trait.\nNote that the \"me\" in \"tareme\" actually means \"eyes\" in Japanese. We simply wish to be clearer, even if it comes off as redundant.\nIts opposite is Tsurime Eyes.\nIf a character normally has Tareme and switches to Tsurime it might signal a change in temperament, personality, or a Beware the Nice Ones moment.\n"}
{"AllOfTimeAtOnce": "Welcome to your favourite Sci-Fi show, where the intrepid adventurers are about to explore the Beyond yet again. In this episode, though, the plot isn't exactly saving the day. It's more like saving all the days. We open with a sweeping establishing shot of the Pyramids of Southbank, dinosaurs ridden by Emperor Mao and Marie Antoinette stalking past. Something, perhaps never explained, has caused all moments in time to be perpetually present \u2014 and somehow all contain the same space, too. Alternatively, your adventurers' journey through the plot is what triggers a Time Crash that results in some kind of chronological collapse. This version is more likely to keep your historical figures and landmarks separate, but even then time isn't going to move, and you're going to be trapped in the entire Universe condensed into a split second.\nEither situation might not focus on the science aspect of science fiction too much, and rather than a trapped-in-time situation or frozen timeline mess, everything that the viewer is expected to recognise has been gathered together to be happening at the same time as each other, but time continues moving. This is probably your safer option, as it's a lot less taxing on the mind whilst still being easily recognisable as a result of breaking or screwing up the timeline.\nOf course, this happening can also create problems when your main get-out clause is time travel. It may have got you into this mess, but it probably can't help get you out, as either the accepted timeline that you've been galavanting through is in another reality and/or your time machine can't break out of the \"now\". You're going to have to find a way to reverse what you did to cause it, usually revolving around people meeting that never should, oddly enough, or a massive frickin' space war. There may also be a timer set as to how long you have to fix time before it completely implodes and, well, not to worry about because then nothing will have ever existed.\nIt's generally accepted that if this happens then you've really messed up. In fact, it might be used in the story as the default way to show The Biggest Time Travel Screw Up Yet, because just putting Hitler in charge wasn't enough of a consequence for your reckless time-hoppers.\nSub-Trope of Time Crash, your all-purpose shop for different ways to affect history (a.k.a. the catalogue of negative time travel effects), this being one of the potential outcomes of bruising up time a bit.

If you're one of the people who appear to have frozen, it may well be that you experience all of time at once: it may be explained as a massive effect version of localized time dilation in which you are experiencing time at a natural pace, but it's comparatively so slowly that you appear frozen, whilst you can see non-frozen peoples' entire lifespans pass in a second. Place Beyond Time, for somewhere that exists outside temporal reality, so it's effectively experiencing none of time at once and may have a viewing platform so you can look at all of time at once.\n"}
{"AttractivenessDiscrimination": "There are a plethora of different reasons for prejudice in different societies. Whether it be race, religion, political beliefs, or socioeconomic status, prejudice is present in many situations, both fictional and non-fictional. However, one of the oldest forms of prejudice was formed for no more reason than simply being too attractive or not attractive enough to earn another's respect. This is where this trope kicks in.\nAlso termed as Lookism, this trope involves the circumstance in a story or setting where an individual or group are blatantly given preferential or prejudiced treatment based on their level of physical attractiveness. More often than not, this trope comes into play to show the negative aspects of valuing The Beautiful Elite along with the fallacies of adhering to Beauty Equals Goodness. Considering the so-called elite and good are such because they are viewed as beautiful, expect Hilarity to Ensue when the personal flaws outside of attractiveness come to light. After all, simply supporting or accommodating an individual because they are attractive tends to not progress well if they are meant to provide more than a pretty face. See Beauty Is Bad as examples along with characters displaying disregard for morality or decency because of beliefs in Screw the Rules, I'm Beautiful! or I Have Boobs, You Must Obey!.\nThose that fall on the unattractive end of the treatment in stories tend to suffer from varying degrees of social stigma. Some of these levels include suffering from Fantastic Slurs, being rounded up inside a Fantastic Ghetto, being killed off out of disgust by the \"beautiful people\", and/or becoming targets of slavery in most stories. The \"unattractive people\" are often used as an abused workforce or denied any attention whatsoever due to employers either seeing them as inferior or not wanting them around.\nThe circumstance of \"pretty\" people being prejudiced for being pretty can also be present depending on the rules of the setting in addition to acts of Positive Discrimination. Such cases are presented in a manner displaying physical beauty as a condescending trait that breeds animosity or disdain in in others reminiscent to Tall Poppy Syndrome. See Beauty Is Bad, Makeup Is Evil, and So Beautiful, It's a Curse.\nThere's a strong case of Truth in Television, considering studies have shown that human infants as young as 14 hours from birth prefer to look at attractive faces rather than unattractive faces. This preference for the \"beautiful\" often extends into the workplace due to prospective workers being mainly or only Hired for Their Looks at worst, the dating world, and even media.\n"}
{"CreditsRunningSequence": "In a lot of anime, a character (usually the protagonist) will show up in the opening or ending credits, running along while remaining on a fixed spot on-screen. The character could be running the whole time, or start out walking slowly and gradually pick up speed. The background is usually of the scrolling kind, but sometimes the character actually seems to run through a changing scenery. In any case, it's rare for characters to maintain a leisurely speed the whole time; usually, this has something to do with either the pace of the music, or the animators' need to keep opening and ending themes moving fast at all times.\nSide-on running and walking cycles are often created by animators as a way to get a feel for the characters, and these cycles will no doubt be used at some point in the show, so this could count as a cross between Shown Their Work and Stock Footage.\nThis trope can occasionally overlap with Team Shot.\n"}
{"SlidingScaleOfDivineIntervention": "Otherwise known as \"When a character yells Smite Me, O Mighty Smiter!!, the chance that the Mighty Smiter will actually oblige.\"\nOn a scale of 1 to n:\n0: Gods Don't Really Exist.\nReligion exists but no one is really receiving the prayers. At best, the gods are myth and superstition; if the author is charitable enough toward religion they may have religiously-motivated characters at least doing good works in the name of their god. If the author is less sympathetic,, then Belief Makes You Stupid and better people have Outgrown Such Silly Superstitions. Or you have a Religion of Evil and/or Path of Inspiration where the only real benefactors are the corrupt men that run it.\n1: The Gods Have Left the Building\nGod or gods were present once, but for all intents and purposes have left or died or were sealed away (think the Titans of Greek myth).

They may be The Creator and may keep the laws of nature working behind the scenes but there's no way to tell if they care about being worshiped or not. Might be either True Neutral or Above Good and Evil. Or they are Neglectful Precursors. Authors who write Watchmaker gods are either neutral about the idea of God or hold the viewpoint that the beauty of nature, physics, math, order, etc, are sufficient justification for God's existence (A.K.A. the Watchmaker Argument), though they may not share the same views about organized religion. Sufficiently hard sci-fi works rarely go above this level on the scale.\n3: God Works In Mysterious Ways:\nGods have an influence on the mortal plane and a vested interest in the people on it. However they do not (i.e. The Gods Must Be Lazy) or can not (i.e. God's Hands Are Tied) intervene directly. They may send signs, omens and occasional lightning strikes, or a mortal in their service acquires powers to do the gods will, whether or not they're entirely sure what that will is. If two gods are fighting, expect the fighting to spill over to their followers. Or they exist outside the mortal plane but their power can be drawn on by the occult-minded. An atheist or a Nay-Theist may still get away with not being struck down. At this level, gods start to acquire Anthropomorphic Personifications and may Need Prayer Badly. This is about as high as strict realistic settings go.\n4: God Walks Among Us\nGods can manifest themselves directly. It may be a God in Human Form and it may be your copilot. Probably makes the rain fall and the wheat grow. May even take human husbands and wives. If you piss this type of god off, expect a mighty smiting. Pray that they aren't Jerkass Gods or expect to be smote more often and painfully. However, people still have reasonable free will and the gods are not necessarily infallible and may still need the help of their followers to do their smiting.\n5 through Infinity: God-King of the Cosmos\nGod is everywhere, omniscient, omnipresent and truly omnipotent, and makes sure everyone knows it. In this universe, You Can't Fight Fate if Fate does indeed exist.\nSandbox God\nFor this \"God\" all of the above may or even may not apply, but only for their little world, or sandbox. Outside of this sandbox however, he or she is powerless, or at the very least, just simply not all-powerful. Not actually gods by the traditional definition.\nIgnorant God\nThis entity is a god, but for all intents and purposes, does not realize that they are a god. Can manifest as any of the above 5, as since they don't know what they are, their power, while undeniable, is also random (Suzumiya Haruhi). Said ignorance can be due to any number of factors, including a divine memory gambit meant to delay insanity due to being everything and every possibility at once, and being unable to evolve or change (see God Emperor and Heretics of Dune, and Ghost in the Shell).\nGods who are actually Sufficiently Advanced Aliens are difficult to place because they might fall anywhere on the scale from 1 (setting themselves up as gods making lesser races their worshipful servants) to 2 (Precursors) all the way up to 5 (The Q Continuum). That baring the debate over whether they count as gods at all.\nSee also Super Weight.\n"}
{"InstantSobriety": "A couple of characters are engaging in a night of heavy drinking, possibly at a bar or Wild Teen Party. After a series of wildly hilarious shenanigans that would only be engaged in by the very intoxicated, possibly summed up as a Binge Montage, the characters need to have a Very Serious Conversation. Luckily, they become Suddenly Sober, and can speak all the plot-relevant dialogue that will advance the story exactly as required, without once spotting a pink elephant or declaring \"I love you man... no, no, but, you... I love YOU man.\"\nSuddenly Sober is the moment in a movie or TV show in which a drunken character suddenly transforms from a word-slurring, sidewalk-tripping, projectile-vomiting mess to a highly-coordinated, quick-thinking, somehow enlightened (and much more sober) version. This could be brought about by some sort of crazy action sequence, a sudden realization, or any other sort of device that moves the plot along. Usually results in uncannily clear thinking or cat-like reflexes, depending on the situation. This trope can also apply to characters who are high, tweaked, etc. and suddenly sober up.\n"}
{"SlippySlideyIceworld": "Cold, cold, cold as Alaska and the Yukon put together. Thankfully, you usually won't freeze to death.\nIce is in great abundance for your slipping and sliding pleasure, and expect Super Drowning Skills if you fall in the water. Even if your character can normally swim, he usually finds himself turned into an ice cube if he falls into the water of an Ice World. Expect an occasional blizzard to blow you off ledges and screw up your jumps. Sizable Snowflakes are often used to make the atmosphere more enchanting.\nIce caves are a common variation/addition. In this case, watch out for icicles from all directions that are more than eager to drop on your head.\nDue to these gameplay difficulties and general perceived unhospitality of the landscape, an Ice Level is typically seen towards the third quarter of the game.\nThis serves as an excusable way to introduce one form of video game difficulty, namely reducing the player's extent of control over their character. The natural properties of frozen water lend themselves to this easily, and since ice is a very common substance you don't have to come up with awkward excuses for why the characters encounter it. The problem then is determining how much to control to remove from the player - too much and it becomes nothing more than Fake Difficulty.\nEnemies and bosses of an Ice World usually fall into three categories: Animals found in the Arctic or other generally cold areas (Polar Bears and Penguins, seals, walruses, etc., plus the occasional Yeti or snowman) who are trying to kill the hero for no good reason; Mooks equipped/designed for cold weather, and \"ice versions\" of enemies found in other areas.\nPerfectly cubical blocks of ice are also surprisingly common, and can usually be moved to solve puzzles, or melted with fire-based attacks. Careful, as these blocks may have enemies frozen within them ready to attack you the moment they get thawed.\nSlippy Slidey Ice Worlds are also a common example of a Single-Biome Planet. It's one of the more realistic ones, depending on how far the planet is from its sun.\nSometimes, the action takes place by night to feature some beautiful Wintry Auroral Sky for Scenery Porn.\nThe term \"Slippy Slidey Ice World\" was invented by the UK computer game magazine Amiga Power to describe what they considered to be an irritating trend of making platforms slippery just to add Fake Difficulty. Of course, as far as this trope is concerned, it also encompasses non-slippy, but snowy, worlds.\nThese levels have become a staple of platforming games and it's rare to find one without an ice level. As another UK gaming magazine, NGC, put it, \"leaving out an ice level is like eating baby Jesus. Not a right thing to do\".\nExpect soft, echoey, \"soothing\" music which may not match the tone of the game, especially if it's an RPG. Alternately, there's a good chance (especially in older games) for ice levels to have a Christmas theme, in which case expect to hear public domain carols. Snowy Sleigh Bells are also very common.\nThe Slippy Slidey Ice World has even been given its own \"holiday\" in the form of Obligatory Ice Level Day. You'd think Christmas already counts, but 1) a minority of climates have snow and ice as opposed to other times of year, and 2) Christmas is about a lot of things, not just ice levels.\nContrast Lethal Lava Land and Shifting Sand Land, which are opposite in terms of temperature and humidity. If they're in the same level, you have just reached Hailfire Peaks.\n"}

{"Meganeko": "Exactly What It Says on the Tin: Really Big Cats.\nThis trope is about cats that are exceptionally larger than is the norm for their species. For the standard \"lions and tigers\" variety of big cat, see Panthera Awesome. Fictional Cat Folk species do not count for this trope, however big they may be.\nThe name is a combination of Mega- from Greek megas, meaning large or great, and Neko from the Japanese word for cat. It should not to be confused with Meganekko (two Ks, one word), which is about how bespectacled girls are cute. However, do compare with Cute Kitten. If this trope and Meganekko do overlap, she'll be a Cat Girl. Subtrope of Dire Beast. If a cat is not supersized, but merely chubby, it's a Fat Cat.\nJust the thing for dealing with Rodents of Unusual Size, but be wary of Canis Major. Subtrope of Animals Not to Scale and/or Cute Giant.\n"}
{"HumansAreLeaders": "In general, wherever humans coexist with other races, the humans tend to be the dominant or driving force in whatever effort they're involved in. They're the ones who tend to be the guys behind creating The Alliance and holding it together, the ones coming up with most of the plans on how to thwart The Empire, or\u2014in somewhat darker settings\u2014the ones able to manipulate other races into doing their bidding for them. If a Five-Man Band is made of five different species, then the human will be The Leader; if Humans Are Average, this may overlap with Standardized Leader.\nWhat's really interesting is this is actually quite justified. Most evolutionary biologists are certain that a greater ability to cooperate and coordinate than any other species is one of the two traits that enabled humanity to conquer the planet in real life (the other being tool use). Thus, in a world with other sentient species, it would naturally follow that humans would be better at leading compared to others, possibly to the point of leadership being humanity's hat.\nThis trope is a specific permutation of Humans Are Special. While it can be found in all forms of media, it's particularly prevalent in video games, where it usually translates into some kind of bonus to diplomacy.\nCompare and contrast Humans Are Warriors; both may be in play at the same time, but usually it's either one or the other. Definitely contrast with Humans Are Morons. Mighty Whitey is an earthbound sister trope. Goes hand-in-hand with Humans Are Diplomats, and occasionally with Humanity Is Superior. Probably influenced by Most Writers Are Human as well.\n"}
{"AngstDissonance": "Let's face it, life is tough, and it's not made easier when you're a Chew Toy.\nAnd when the going gets tough - and let's face it, since True Art Is Angsty, it will - even the tough can start to whine. Of course, depending on age, the whining will be different, but nonetheless they'll whine. In fiction, however, no matter how justified the character's complaints are there's a delicate balance between enough whining and too much, and unfortunately characters that should have a right to angst can lose the sympathy of the audience if the audience no longer wants to listen. Many situations in fiction do not happen in real life, therefore most audiences cannot truly sympathize with the character and can find them annoying. This phenomenon is known as Angst Dissonance.\nNote that Angst Dissonance is a personal limit, and different people have different levels of tolerance for exactly how much they're willing to put up with; furthermore, a lot of these depend as much on how the character is being read / written rather than any inherent issues in the text. Nevertheless, there are a few theories as to why this occurs, and some of the key contributing factors to Angst Dissonance include:\nEssentially, as noted above, this trope largely exists due to a prevailing belief among some that True Art Is Angsty; that 'art' should only be concerned with exploring angst and pain and thus (in theory) reflect the real world. Of course, most people engage with art and fiction at least in part to escape the problems of the real world in a fictional one where these problems can be resolved more easily and satisfactorily, and don't always like having them thrown back at them (especially if, as noted above, the creators are going way over the top with it). These creators also tend to ignore / forget / disdain the fact that life is also made up of uplifting, encouraging bits as well, which people like to be reminded of. This can cause problems to arise between the creators, who are attempting to make an artistic statement about their characters and the world they inhabit, and the readers, who simply find that artistic statement too depressing (or annoying).\nAngst Dissonance can lead to creators going right into Wangst if the Dissonance goes way over the top, as no matter how genuine the complaint people will get turned off if the character's moaning goes too far, especially if all they're doing is complaining without attempting to effectively deal with the problem. If the creators try too hard to generate angst for the characters without accurately judging exactly how much angsty backstory the audience can reasonably tolerate, and don't take steps to pull back when they might be going too far, then Deus Angst Machina can be the result. Angst Dissonance can also be the result if the show's relying on a visit from Diabolus ex Machina, which can damage the show's credibility and the audience's ability to suspend their disbelief. If the character's complaints stem from something that is actually pretty cool, then the character is Cursed with Awesome - and audiences hate it when characters complain about powers and abilities that they'd love to have. If overused, may cause Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy.\nUsing a Cozy Voice for Catastrophes can mitigate Angst Dissonance, in that while the character in question is still hurting deeply, at least he's pleasantly chatty about it. Similarly, the Happy Flashback can show that characters weren't always angst-bags.\n"}
{"Overprotectivedad": "You know this guy. You might even be this guy, if you're a father. Well aware of the sex-obsessed horndogs that teenage guys can be\u2014probably because he used to be one\u2014the Overprotective Dad wants to protect his daughter from being exploited. Unfortunately, he tends to take it all too far, holding the Eight Simple Rules For Dating My Teenaged Daughter as his personal bible.\nOnce he gets over his denial that his baby is all grown up, the Overprotective Dad becomes convinced that her smiling at a boy, let alone kissing or dating, is half a step away from having sex and getting pregnant. Parties are always an orgy if she is going.\nIt's not just a matter of My Girl Is Not a Slut (translated for the father/daughter dynamic); it's that he doesn't trust guys around her, and he's probably also displacing some angst about \"losing\" his little girl. Unfortunately for the poor young man who eventually attracts her interest, the Overprotective Dad isn't going to be inclined to give him an inch\u2014he will receive No Sympathy for any chaos that results from their courtship, and even the slightest or most obvious misunderstanding or misconception about the man will have the Overprotective Dad warning him to \"stay away from her!\"\nOn some occasions, it's obvious to everyone that the Overprotective Dad is merely using that as a (fairly weak) excuse to keep the suitor away from his baby girl. In the rare event that he finds a suitor he can tolerate, he will still threaten the boy with dire consequences If You Ever Do Anything to Hurt Her....\nThis trope is especially common in stereotypes of the Deep South, where every sweet Georgia Peach has a very large (usually fat, hairy, and drunk) father in a white tank top that usually keeps a rifle or shotgun with him at all times.\nIf Adults Are Useless, then he'll probably just be comic relief as he huffs and puffs ineffectually. Otherwise, he may serve as a Parent ex Machina to deliver the message that you Can't Get Away with Nuthin' and ground his daughter at some point. Somewhere between those two is the Overprotective Dad who ends up enforcing a Shotgun Wedding after the condom breaks.\nSee also Twerp Sweating. Compare My Sister Is Off-Limits!. Spear Counterpart of My Beloved Smother. Contrast Fantasy-Forbidding Father. Also see Meddling Parents.\nDepending on how this is played and how much you want to dissect it, this trope can carry all of the same problems as My Girl Is Not a Slut and may imply that the woman in question is less an agent of her own destiny than her male relatives or, worse yet, that she's somehow their property. The concept can also easily become even Squickier with a Pervert Dad. Ironically, if the father has a son, he may applaud or encourage him if he treats girls in the exact way he doesn't want other guys to treat his own daughter.\nGender Flips are less common, i.e. fathers more concerned about the girls/women their sons date. This is due to several double standards, such as Men Are Tough, All Men Are Perverts, and A Man Is Always Eager. Cougars are usually jokes instead of threats; men are subjected to pedo hunts. Overprotective moms are also very rare, typically not being all that concerned with who their kid of either sex dates. At worst they'll be My Beloved Smother, who's more likely to nag and nitpick the significant other, usually a woman, to death for not being good enough for her son/kid which isn't the same as threatening to kill somebody for talking to your daughter. They're also just as, if not more likely, to wait until after the wedding before they start antagonizing their child's significant other.\nHe may or may not think he's being Papa Wolf (but those tropes don't overlap at all, anyway). If it belongs in the latter then don't put it here. The same person can be both at different times but those times are different. However, this trope might overlap with Knight Templar Parent if the dad goes to dangerous extremes in their overprotectiveness.\nOddly, we never seem to hear from the boys' parents, who, one assumes, might object to their sons being threatened with violence.\nNote that applying this trope in Real Life is a very bad idea as it gives the message to teenagers that they don't get to control who's allowed to be intimate with them or have any agency over their own lives and other people are allowed make the decision for them\u2014which often leads to them becoming involved in abusive relationships once they do finally get out from under their parent's immediate control.

They're not even a Jerk with a Heart of Gold; they're just misunderstood.\nThis character is automatically assumed to be evil due to their solitude, but turns out to have a heart of gold. They appear most often in kiddy programs to deliver that age-old \"don't judge a book by its cover\" aesop. They may have some dark secret which, while goodhearted, seems sinister, or needs to be covered up to keep the Masquerade.\nCompare Crazy Cat Lady, Madwoman in the Attic, The Hermit, and the Bait-and-Switch Tyrant.

{"EyesAreMental": "It seems that by some law of Shapeshifting, Shape Shifters are unable to change their eyes, no matter how skilled they are at changing form.

{"HesOkay": "A common situation that in some ways is the opposite of He's Dead, Jim. A character is knocked out in a fight, or otherwise injured. Another character says that the first character is okay. It always turns out that the second character is right about this, regardless of not having any medical training, and regardless of whether the injury really could be easily survived. (For the trope about the injury itself rather than about characters' seeming ability to diagnose it, see Only a Flesh Wound.)\nThis can also happen when a character says \"I'm Okay!\" and turns out to be correct. (If the character is wrong about it, there are other tropes; see I Can Still Fight! and Zombie Infectee.)\n"}
{"ImmortalAssassin": "Someone's put the hit out on you. But no matter, you're armed and dangerous yourself, and when the hitman catches up with you, you get the drop on him, and simply put two in his chest. Problem solved, crisis averted.\nAnd then he gets up, dusts himself off, mutters some kind of pithy one-liner, and comes after you again.\nYou've just run into the Immortal Assassin.\nThis character shows up frequently in works of fantasy and science fiction. The professional killer who themselves cannot be killed. Either they are straight-out indestructible, or they possess a Healing Factor that lets them recover from any injury. Why they hire themselves out as hitmen can vary from character to character.\nDepending on the universe, the Immortal Assassin may have been given their immortality through supernatural or technological means. Often, Immortal Assassins are much older than they appear, not able to die of natural causes, and as such can have a bad case of \"immortal angst\" or \"immortal smugness\". If they hail from a time and place before gunpowder was invented, they may prefer bladed weapons or hand-to-hand combat, eschewing guns as \"uncivilized\" or \"clumsy.\" As a consequence, they will possess phenomenal martial arts skills, honed from hundreds of years of practice.\nMany Immortal Assassins consider themselves absolute professionals, devoted to the job at hand. They see killing as an art form, and make a serious effort to be as close to perfect as they can get. They may adhere to their own version of a \"warrior's code,\" with a strong sense of personal honor. Often, this is because they come from ancient cultures that put a great emphasis on honor and martial prowess, and they see their careers as an extension of that.\nOf course, there are exceptions. Some Immortal Assassins are sadists who kill out of pleasure or out of boredom. Being unable to die has left them so emotionally detached from the human race that killing mortals is little more than a game to them, a way to pass the time. Others are simply in it for the money. Some are just Ax-Crazy...\nMost of the time, the Immortal Assassin is the villain of the story. They can be a Knight of Cerebus, brought in by the Big Bad when all other plans have failed, a genuine unstoppable badass more dangerous than any our heroes have yet faced. Maybe they're a Diabolus ex Nihilo. Alternatively, they may be a sympathetic character, particularly if whatever circumstances led to their becoming immortal or an assassin (or both) are tragic enough. On occasion, they will even do a Heel\u2013Face Turn, join the heroes, and become The Atoner. If part of an ensemble, they may even be used for comic relief; since Immortal Life Is Cheap, the Immortal Assassin can suffer truly horrific injuries and shrug them off.\nThere may be ways in-universe to defeat the Immortal Assassin. The Assassin may have a carefully-guarded weak spot, or they may be injured so greviously that their healing factor simply may not be able to compensate. Another option is total physical destruction of the Assassin's body, so that there is nothing left for the healing factor to regenerate. Use of Applied Phlebotinum may kill them, or deprive them of their immortality. Alternatively, the Assassin may be neutralized without being killed, imprisoned somehow, or even become Sealed Evil in a Can. Or in some cases, if the Assassin is just in it for the money and has no personal stake in the proceedings, simply calling off the hit will be enough.\nThere may be overlap with the Implacable Man, particularly if the Immortal Assassin isn't entirely human.\n"}
{"RotatingNarrator": "A switching Point of View is closely related to, but distinct from, Rotating Protagonist. Rather than an omniscient third-person narrator showing us Jack, then Sally, then Pauline, as we would with a Rotating Protagonist, we see the story from Jack's perspective, then Sally's, then Pauline's. Can be very useful if the POV is third-person limited or first-person, as this can give us information we otherwise wouldn't have \u2014 for instance, we could find out that Pauline's motivations are genuinely good or she really did kill that guy, something neither Jack nor Sally would know.\nThe most obvious way to do this is to switch from Jack being \"I\" to Sally being \"I,\" as even if they're both in the scene, it's clear whom the focus is on. A book can also pull this off with third-person limited (you see both as \"s/he\", but you're only inside one's head at a time). Primarily a literature trope, but a duet or film can also work. You just need narration of some sort.\nSwitching from first person (I) to second (you) or third (s/he) would also work. Obviously, this is quite useful if one character falls unconscious or ill, or is simply not where the author needs the story to be.\nSister Trope to \"Rashomon\"-Style, but the accounts do not need to disagree or even overlap, and also Rotating Protagonist, but rather than simply seeing different characters, we get their perspectives. Super Trope to Scrapbook Story. See also Twisted Echo Cut. When all main characters get their POV represented except one, it's a Non-P.O.V. Protagonist. Not to be confused with Camera Perspective Switch.\n"}
{"InvoluntaryTransformation": "A character gets hit with a spell, Curse, or Transformation Ray, causing an instantaneous and involuntary transformation into a form that is harmless or otherwise seriously impairs their ability to pursue their goals, until they can revert to their usual form by some means. This is commonly some sort of animal creature (whether real or fantastic), though it can also be a plant or a lifeless object. They may or may not lose their voice, or even their mental faculties (in which case someone else will have to seek the cure for them).\nFrogs, newts, and toads are so common that they have their own subtrope, Bewitched Amphibians. Other common choices include mice, chickens, pigs, and sheep.\nIn role-playing or video games, this is frequently a Standard Status Effect that will disable or greatly weaken most attacks and magic, but will rarely affect the victim's Hit Points or armor. People may get turned into toads, but\u2014hot damn\u2014those toads will be Made of Iron! A notable exception is when insects are involved, in which case the victim is not long for this world.\nThis is common in fiction, as it's a way for a spellcaster to defeat a foe with magic without simply killing them, or as a form of punishment (e.g. underlings who failed their boss one time too many). It's also generally less permanent and more palatable than actual death. Often requires a hero to find the magic \"cure\" to turn his friend back into a person. This can be also be used to show a specific aspect of the character's personality, such as gluttons turned into pigs, or cowards into chickens.\nOccasionally in fiction a character may manage to save the day while still under this effect, sometimes through use of the animal form's abilities. This will lead to the Aesop that it's brains, not strength, that's important. Or that courage is more important than size. Or that you can lay an egg and still feel like a man.\nIf the transformation is presented to disturb and frighten the viewer, it becomes Transformation Horror. It will then probably be a Painful Transformation.\nWhether or not a Baleful Polymorph is effective against a Voluntary Shapeshifter varies, depending on whether or not it also imposes a Shapeshifter Mode Lock \u2014 otherwise the shapeshifter can just transform themselves back to normal, or at least something else. Thus, it is a subtrope of curses.\nDepending on the method, clothing may be transformed as well, or it may not, resulting in Shapeshifting Excludes Clothing if the characters or audience are aware of this fact, or Empty Piles of Clothing if they are not. (In either case, naturally, when they get turned back they're going to need those clothes back...)\nPolymorphing into a nonliving form is much less likely to be played for laughs and much more likely to be permanent.\nCan be used as a Karmic Transformation. Characters transformed this way may also exhibit Morphic Resonance. See also Emergency Transformation, Shape Shifter Mashup and Beauty to Beast. Compare Taken for Granite (turning into a statue), Unwilling Roboticisation (turning from flesh into something mechanical). Contrast with Hybrid Overkill Avoidance, where the subject is immune to further polymorphing because they're already supernatural. Compare Involuntary Shapeshifter.\n"}
{"PlayingTennisWithTheBoss": "Alright, this is it. You're facing the boss, and it's a big one. He's charging up an energy attack, just getting ready to launch it at you. What do you do? Do you dodge out of the way? Block with your shield? Scream like a little girl?\nNope. Swing, batta batta, swing! That's right, smack that ball of destruction right back towards 'im! If you're lucky, he won't be ready, and it'll hit him, leaving him open for a few good whacks with your Weapon of Choice. If you're not, he'll hit it back and the game is on. For the extra-challenging variety, the ball will speed up each time you do this, so that eventually, you're furiously mashing the button to attack again and again and hoping that the boss misses before you do.\nSometimes, the boss will let out a different energy attack that can't be deflected. If you hit that projectile, it'll probably explode and you'll be damaged.\nIncidentally, it doesn't really count as Playing Tennis if the boss's light-based energy projectiles are simply reflecting off your Mirror Shield\u2014rebounding the attack must require timing and reflexes.\nIt also should be noted that the first time you encounter this trope, you usually have no idea what to do. It's really one of those things that only makes sense in video games.\nWhy the boss feels the need to use the one attack that can damage itself at all is unknown.\nDespite the name, this is not solely restricted to bosses. However, bosses are much more likely to fall into this behavior.\nSee also Hoist by His Own Petard, Puzzle Boss, Beam-O-War, Parrying Bullets.\nFor instances where you play a literal, friendly tennis match against the boss, see Go-Karting with Bowser.\n"}
{"SwordBeam": "Swords are awesome. For a hero worth their salt, they are practically a requirement. But there's one tiny little flaw: a complete lack of range. Now, how would your One-Man Army hero be able to routinely face and prevail over entire groups of enemies packing (cross)bows, firearms or ranged magic? Well, there are many ways around depending on your setting, but there's hardly anything that is a more distilled Rule of Cool than Sword Beams.\nA character will make a slashing motion with their Cool Sword, but at a distance, optionally charging the weapon with power right before this. What springs forth is a beam of Pure Energy, usually crescent-shaped. It travels through the air or on the ground, either keeping the original size and shape or covering a full sector of the swing, thus growing larger with distance. Often features Absurd Cutting Power, allowing The Hero to fell entire companies of Mooks in one fell swoop. Arbitrary Maximum Range prevents it from cutting anything outside of the intended battlefield.\nAnother version is stabbing or smashing the blade into the ground and creating a Ground Wave that may or may not actually tear through the earth as it crashes towards the enemy. Sword Beams fired by thrusting a sword at its target (or even just pointing the sword in their direction and using it as a Magic Wand) are rarer, but they do exist.\nWhen magical this is a type of Full-Contact Magic, and when not it falls under Implausible Fencing Powers. If the \"beam\" is a shockwave of compressed air which cuts things, then it's also a Razor Wind. If used with a Laser Blade, it often looks more like the blade is extending to strike the target.\nSee also Bayonet Ya (for guns with what are basically swords attached) and Mix-and-Match Weapon (for swords that are also guns), and Throwing Your Sword Always Works (for another, less magical way of using a sword as a ranged weapon). Compare Energy Bow (for bows that shoot beams) and Magic Staff (which is usually a magical tool first, and a weapon second). Can be combined with Blade Spam for a unique variant of Beam Spam.\nNot to be confused with a Beam Sword or with Beams Shaped Like Swords (though a sword made of beams that shoots beams made of swords would be pretty awesome).\n"}
{"TwinMaker": "The concept of clones or copies being made to replace original people, usually either as a means of teleportation (by creating a copy somewhere else and destroying the original) or as a way of obtaining immortality (creating clones to replace a dying or dead original, for example).\nThe Twin Maker is often a convenient way of bringing a dead character back from the dead without needing to invoke any trope that revives the old character. In manner and appearance, they are almost always perfect doppelgangers, indistinguishable from the original. This trope is often used in a science-fiction setting, where it can be readily justified by any amount of technobabble on cloning, teleportation devices, copying machines, and the like. Fantasy and other works involving magic are also natural habitats for this trope. When an original is not dead yet, there may be some interaction between them and their clone, but usually it's a case of Never the Selves Shall Meet.\nWhere this trope gets interesting is how the moral status of the new copy and the moral implications of disposing of the original are handled. First, the treatment of the twin: Some characters won't see the problem with treating them both as if they were the same person, whereas others will point out that it only works from an external viewpoint: the person will seem exactly the same to everyone else, but the actual stream of consciousness has been severed,note\u00a0 Probably. Maybe. Perhaps. It's difficult to tell, because even from the point of view of the person at the far end of the device, there is no break in consciousness. As far as they are concerned, they went into the device and came out the other end, the same as ever. The person at the near end, if they weren't destroyed, is similar, as from their perspective the teleportation simply failed to work. And if they were destroyed... well, they're not around to share their perspective anymore, are they? And so their experience of the event remains unknown (and unknowable, barring the use of a spirit medium, which opens up a whole new can of worms in and of itself) and the new copy is, in this sense, a completely different person. Sometimes it will be argued that the copy doesn't count as the original person, though given how interchangeable they would be if the paperwork for their birth certificates were ever mixed up, this argument is harder to hold up for long.\nSecond, the ethics of disposing of the original: If this matter is addressed at all in fiction, the Uniqueness Value and Cloning Blues tropes may well be invoked or played with as part of the story. A teleportation machine that worked in the manner of the short story To Be (see quotation above) would probably be regarded as a killing machine, but if there is any doubt about whether the stream-of-consciousness continues or not, the issue may well be sidestepped. If nothing in the device suggests anything sinister, it's generally treated as harmless. It's probably a straightforward teleportation.\nOccasionally, the dilemma may even be taken a step farther, if the Twin Maker in question doesn't make it clear which of the two is the \"Twin\". If it's just as feasible that the device teleports the person who uses it to the new location, still alive and themselves, while simultaneously producing an identical duplicate at the starting point, then which one is the \"original\" person may be impossible to determine.\nIf the Twin Maker is kept a secret, it will probably be part of The Reveal. Particularly devious characters may exploit the Twin Maker for their own ends, perhaps to create decoys to lure out assassins, or to dispose of an Unwitting Pawn by \"tweaking\" it mid-way through its creation.\nOften involves Cloning Blues. Clone Jesus and You Cloned Hitler! are related, but not subtropes. If there is a sizeable distance between the \"twins\" then it may be a form of Mental Space Travel.\n"}
{"PreOrderBonus": "So you've followed all the press about your favorite video game for months; watching every trailer, reading every interview, playing every demo, until you finally get a release date. You're anticipating this game so much that you head on over to your local Trope Co. game store to pre-order, because you have to be the first person to play this amazing game. But that's not the only reason you pre-order. Only the first shipment of 10,000 units is going to have the super ultra limited edition behind the scenes DVD and bonus cloth overworld map with limited-edition action figures not sold in stores! The game developers just lured you in with a pre-order bonus.\nThis is a limited bonus offered by retail chains or publishers to incite you to pre-order an upcoming game. Is commonly the game's official soundtrack, a free Strategy Guide, \"behind the scenes\" featurette, a demo of another game, or the usual suspects. Occasionally, there will be different bonuses depending on the retailer; to get them all; there's a healthy trade on eBay for the codes of such things.\nThe really cool ones probably won't reach Europe, or be standard there. Though on the other hand, the really really cool ones will probably never leave Japan.\nMany game retailers have different Pre Order Bonuses for the same game, meaning that if you're a completist you have to either buy the game several times or hope that some of it later becomes DLC.\nPre-orders are also common with music - digital downloads will often come with pre-order exclusive bonus tracks. Occasionally, independent record stores will provide something extra with a pre-order as well.\nIn these days where people buy stuff and receive only a download, pre-ordering something became kinda irrelevant since there isn't the problem of the product going out of stock, so pretty much all pre-orders have bonuses or discounts so people will still be tempted to buy the game before anyone from the public knows if it's going to be good or not.\nSee also Limited Special Collector's Ultimate Edition.\n"}
{"UniversalRemoteControl": "A form of Magic from Technology whereby a TV remote control works on reality itself. Somehow, the remote imbues its wielder with bonafide Reality Warper abilities, such as being able to control time with the pause, fast-forward, and rewind buttons, take away people's voices with mute, or even change the entire environment by \"channel-hopping\". Although, callous users may find out that Reality Warping Is Not a Toy.\nSister Trope to Rewriting Reality. See also Handy Remote Control, which is far more mundane.\n"}
{"UnevenHybrid": "Due to the prevalence of the Interspecies Romance, half-human and other varieties of interspecies hybrid children are fairly common in fiction. These characters may in turn conceive or sire children with pure-blood members of either parent's species, producing a second generation with a majority of one species and a minority of the other.\nSuch individuals are likely to demonstrate various traits from their minority ancestor, though such traits are likely to be more subtle the farther back said ancestor is.\nCompare Half-Human Hybrid and Non-Human Humanoid Hybrid for simple half-and-half combinations. Once three or more species get involved, you're dealing with a Heinz Hybrid. May overlap with Semi-Divine. For human/nonhuman examples, compare But Not Too Foreign, where a foreigner has their nation of residence's ethnicity somewhere in their ancestry.\n"}
{"Realism": "This trope describes the aesthetic school known as Realism.\nThe idea is extremely simple: Art should replicate real life as closely as possible, and within real life, those things are the common, routine, and ordinary rather than the unusual and outstanding. It should be a \"Slice of Life\" if you will, and consistent with our expectations of reality outside the text. Realism has had various movements in different media over the centuries, and not necessarily coincident: Theatrical realism became manifest much later than realism in painting. It also appears in other forms in certain genres, such as the seeding idea of hard Science Fiction - the material reality of the fictional world should correspond as closely as possible to that of ours. It informs such concerns as Realistic Diction Is Unrealistic.\nRealism can also have different forms within a given medium. A painting could, for example, be photorealistic but depict Greco-Roman gods battling on a field. Similarly, a painting could be very abstract but depict something understood as realistic, such as two people having a conversation over coffee. The \"Kitchen-Sink\" dramas of the 1950s are an example of one form of realism in the television medium.\nA number of other aesthetic movements have sprung from - and in some cases, in opposition to - realism, such as cubism. The expectation of realism from fiction is actually relatively recent and culturally bound. In literary terms, realism is the distinguishing feature of the novel, specifically psychological realism, where the characters act, or are supposed to act, like real people instead of just acting in certain ways to serve the needs of the plot. (Compare how people act in novels with how people act in fairy tales.)\nEvidently, opinions vary on the topic of realism. It shares a thread of origin with Romanticism, and is more or less the supertrope of Naturalism.\nSee also Reality Is Unrealistic, Realistic Diction Is Unrealistic, Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness, Real Is Brown, Art Imitates Life. Realism is not synonymous with cynicism, but the two are often confused in ways which cause tropes such as edginess, explicitness and goriness to be associated with a work becoming \"more realistic\".\nIn fiction, there are many Acceptable Breaks from Reality, though many works are Like Reality Unless Noted.\nCompare with Socialist Realism. Not to be confused with Real Life.\nExamples in this page will relate to the ways in which some creators have played with realism or mentioned it directly.\n"}
{"WeirdAlEffect": "When a parody of a particular work is more popular than the original work, often to the point where those unfamiliar with the source material will believe that the parody is its own thing.\nNamed for the fact that, when listening to the earlier work of \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, modern fans may be so unfamiliar with the songs being mocked as to not even realize that the Weird Al's song is a parody. For example, many people are now more familiar with \"I Lost on Jeopardy!\" than with the original \"Jeopardy\" by the Greg Kihn Band (or even the original game show from the sixties). Some may even have forgotten Jimmy Webb's \"MacArthur Park,\" or Coolio's \"Gangsta's Paradise\" (or Stevie Wonder's \"Pastime Paradise,\" for that matter), remembering only Weird Al's \"Jurassic Park\" or \"Amish Paradise.\"\nOften, people who are only 'familiar' with a work through the parody are surprised when the subject of the parody turns out to be better than they thought.\nOccasionally the trope can be inverted, where the parody is forgotten, but aspects of it get associated with the original work.\nRelated to the concept of a Forgotten Trope, except it is not tropes but works or personalities that have been forgotten. Could be an extreme expression of Rule of Funny (the music may not have had much staying power, but at least the parody is funny). See also Adaptation Displacement, Popcultural Osmosis, Popcultural Osmosis Failure, Older Than They Think, The Coconut Effect, Covered Up and Revival by Commercialization. Contrast Shallow Parody, when lacking knowledge of the original work merely renders the parody meaningless.\nBe careful: If the original still has a respectable pop culture presence, then claiming the parody is better known may tend toward Fan Myopia.\n"}
{"Neet": "Are you just hanging around your sister's house, watching the kids, doing the laundry, or maybe even just playing video games, with no career prospects, and, from a business point of view at least, not contributing much, if anything at all, to the economy?\nThen you might be a NEET. Not currently engaged in Employment, Education or Training.\nThe NEET is usually a college-age male, though it is occasionally used in regards to females. A NEET is either between jobs and down on his luck, an idiot who has failed the entrance exams for college, or a Lazy Bum with no goals in life, freeloading off whoever is around. Occasionally the NEET might also be a shut-in, and shunning society due to being unable to function well in it, because of some debilitating Ambiguous Disorder, agoraphobia or peer pressure. Whether his condition is his fault or not, he is likely to get no respect whatsoever, be called an embarassment to his friends and family, or have \"Get a job!\" yelled in his face at least once. Probably more than once.\nIn most stories featuring this trope, the NEET is the designated Butt-Monkey, treated with No Sympathy. The Deadpan Snarker will take every opportunity to remind him that he's useless, while more sentimental characters would, at best, try to motivate him to get a life with a Rousing Speech. Anything else, such as treating his situation as a symptom of a systemic problem of modern society, is uncommon enough to be considered a subversion. Regardless, it must be noted that the modern unfortunate conditions on the job market in many developed countries mean that the unemployed gradually undergo a shift from Acceptable Targets to being considered genuinely unfortunate. Thus, in order to actually deserve mockery, a NEET in modern media is often given other negative qualities such as being a slob.\nIf he isn't the Plucky Comic Relief, then he is more than likely The Hero, and the premise behind his story involves finding a worthy goal in life and/or public acceptance. An Aesop can develop in two ways from there onwards: he might get into that college after that cram session with The Smart Guy, get together with a crazy girl who would kick his ass into gear, and generally become a fully functional member of society... or he can give said society the finger, prove that Hard Work Hardly Works and find an outlet for his Brilliant, but Lazy tendencies that render him appreciated in other ways than most people are.\nPretty Freeloaders generally manage to dodge this stigma on the account of, well, being pretty, despite the fact that they might not contribute money to the household, as it's more socially acceptable for a female to be without an income than it is for a male (though this is changing). Only a female in these circumstances who is actively being hassled for not having a job or being in school can be considered a NEET.\nCompare This Loser Is You, Hikikomori and The Slacker. There's also a Spanish version of this trope, called Ni-Ni note\u00a0\"ni estudia, ni trabaja\", \"neither studies, nor works\".\nContrast Idle Rich and Rich Idiot with No Day Job.\nNot to be confused with Keet, though a keet NEET could exist (i.e. Jyushimatsu Matsuno).\n"}
{"TheDocumentary": "In some TV shows they'll take an episode and have a journalist or documentary maker make a show about, well, the show. Someone will go around interviewing all the main, and a few minor, characters, and presenting them from a view likely different than our own; presenting the demure housewife as an ice queen, the brainy kid as a Troubled Child, or the military commander as an Obstructive Bureaucrat instead of the action hero. They will likely get some things wrong, or interpret them oddly. At the very least some in universe media is looking at the setting or characters of the show, and we watch their finished in universe show.\nThe episode is structured around the idea that a fly-on-the-wall documentary crew or news crew is following the characters for a period of time. The footage is often shot with a handheld camera and is offset from the objective camera by other characteristics. Related to Day in the Life and/or Clip Show. A type of Show Within a Show.\nThe documentary crew will usually get in the way of the action somehow, often getting into a fight with the main characters. There may be \"honest interviews\" with characters about an incident, with two characters giving wildly different accounts of an event or circumstance.\nCharacters may also pretend to be nobler, better people when the camera points their way; the ones around them who know better may or may not cooperate in the illusion. Or the camera may just prove them to be a Large Ham.\nAlternatively, the Documentary Episode can be the format for the entire thing, as seen in The Office (both UK and US versions) and People Like Us.\nCompare Faux Documentary, Mockumentary, Who Would Want to Watch Us?, and Perspective Flip. Contrast: Documentary. Note that movies following the Mockumentary format don't belong here. See also Literary Agent Hypothesis.\n"}
{"AlternateRealityEpisode": "An Alternate Reality Episode is slightly different from an episode that incorporates an Alternate Universe.\nIn an Alternate Reality Episode, the usual main characters are absent. The main cast is still here, but they're playing \"themselves\" in a different role. Maybe Alice is now a Dot Com boom millionaire instead of a lowly research assistant, or the other way around. The point is that it's our heroes being different people, not the same people visiting a different place.\nTypically, the \"normal\" situation may get a look-in for a couple of scenes at the start or end of the episode, but there should not be any clear link between the characters - Alice the millionaire should not wake up as Alice the research assistant, or have Bob her millionare buddy visiting her, asking why everything is different.\nCompare with Parody Episode (this trope could be considered the serious side of the coin) and Elseworld. This may be a Mirror Universe episode where we see what the cast would be like if they were evil (especially in Star Trek).\n"}
{"GenreLaunch": "While genres can be known for a variety of works, they don't always start out that way. Usually they start out as loads of obvious Follow the Leader copies of a Genre-Busting or making work, or a Genre Popularizer for a genre so small that this is the first time the mainstream has heard of it. Eventually many of the followers stop being that (though copies still exist), and start having loads of works that stand on their own. This is the point that you don't just have a bunch of clones, you have a full genre.\nThis doesn't always happen, though. Mascot Racers have yet to go past just being Mario Kart clones in spite of both Mario Kart and the clones having been around since The '90s. On the other hand, this can happen almost immediately. Tetris was such a simple game, any clone needed to set itself apart to avoid getting sued.\nCompare Derivative Differentiation (which can be used to help the clones stand out on their own). A Trope Codifier can invert this, if it comes long after the Trope Maker and the original genre was relatively differentiated and well-established before then, and it's followed by a sequence of clones.\nThe opposite is Genre-Killer.\n"}
{"PerilousPlay": "The heroes have been captured and are at the mercy of the villain. Rather than simply killing them, the villain wishes to draw out their torment and humiliate them. So the heroes are forced to perform in a play, often written by the villain themself. This often takes place in front of a Captive Audience. Needless to say, the heroes won't survive til the curtain call. Expect Bad \"Bad Acting\", either from the reluctant performers, the villain's lousy script, or a combination of the two.\nInverse of the Scheherezade Gambit, in which the heroes initiate the performance in order to buy time.\n"}
{"CoolBikes": "So you've got a badass. Or a loner. Or an Action Hero or Action Girl. Now (s)he needs a suitable way to get from Point A to Point B. Because walking isn't very impressive unless you're calmly walking away from the carnage you just caused, or power walking toward the carnage you intend to cause.\nNow you could always go for a cool-looking car. But how about something more personal, and much more impressive?\nEasy. Give them a Cool Bike. No, not a bicycle. The big, shiny, loud, sexy, purely awesome motorcycle. The motorcycle is to a modern character what the big black horse is to the Western or Fantasy character: an identifier, a mark of status, and above all, an accessory that adds to their overall coolness.\nEver since the end of World War Two, motorcycles have been seen as the absolute coolest way to travel. Whether they are traveling through the desert, city streets, a coastal road, or up a wall, the bike can promote an aura of awesome that is unmatched by an other everyday vehicle. Riding a motorcycle lends an aura of independence and attractive danger to the rider.\nCool Bikes come in different types, and the type of bike generally says a lot about the type of character who rides it. A chopped, stripped Harley is virtually almost always the choice of a Badass Biker, and it's also often the choice of the Sociopathic Hero and the Villain Protagonist, while a sleek crotch rocket is more likely to be ridden by an Action Girl, an older Kid Hero or a Jerk Jock. If the Harley is chopped or stripped or neither, the rider could be The Atoner, The Drifter, a major-league Action Girl, an Action Hero, a Supporting Leader, or The Ace. The Adventurer Archaeologist tends toward the lighter, more nimble sport bikes, or even better, an old military bike. Big, heavy Goldwings and other touring bikes aren't usually cool, although their riders may think so.\nThe Badass Biker and the Biker Babe always have a Cool Bike. An Anti-hero is likely to have a Cool Bike. Action Girls may have Cool Bikes. Cool Bikes may have a Cool Sidecar. See Monowheel Mayhem when awesome only needs one wheel.\nOh, and remember that you don't drive a bike; you ride it.\n"}
{"PersonalDictionary": "Pretending that a word means something it does not; not in an attempt to help a language evolve, but in a Last Stand defending your words and your honor!.\nSay you're trying to convince people on a message board that a politician you don't like is a fascist (this could apply to just about any major political party). They aren't buying it. Well, the dictionary is irrefutable, so you look up fascism.\nDamn it! This politician's views don't fit the definition of fascism at all!\nWait ... That's just their definition of fascism, not yours. Of course it's the label of fascism that is bad, and not the actual definition, so you just make the label apply, and make everyone believe you. And maybe if you do it for long enough, it will catch on and they'll fix the dictionary!\nWays to do this are:\nKeep in mind that Tropes Are Not Bad, and the dictionary meaning of words can and do change over time- many dictionaries now include some variation on \"derogatory term for a disliked politician/political group seen as dictatorial\" as one definition of fascism, for instance. (Dictionaries, we should remember, simply record the ways words are commonly used, not necessarily the ways any prescriptivist groups think they \"should\" be used.) Attempting to create a new meaning by yourself, however, is a good way prove you have Delusions of Eloquence.\nCompare Malapropism, Newspeak, Implausible Deniability, Chewbacca Defense, No True Scotsman, Metaphorically True, and Unusual Euphemism. Not to be confused with Neologism which is making up words to add to current dictionaries. Twisting the Words is when someone applies this trope to a word someone else used, and Separated by a Common Language and Did Not Do the Bloody Research is when they are using the word correctly- with a different dictionary.\nContrast Accidental Innuendo, and Unfortunate Implications when someone uses a word strictly by the dictionary definition ignoring important colloquial meanings, and Jive Turkey and Totally Radical for when dictionaries finally catch up with past vernacular a few years late. Have a Gay Old Time and hilarity ensue when the alternate slang meaning becomes the primary meaning, and Get Thee to a Nunnery occurs when a slang meaning is lost to time.\nThe antithesis of this trope is when someone observes, \"You Keep Using That Word...\"\nSee also: Artistic License \u2013 Linguistics\n"}
{"DarkAges": "\"Dark Ages\" is a term for the period in European history from the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 to circa 1000, where there is a perception of little intellectual development culturally and the few surviving records of what happened still leave a lot of things unanswered.\nYou may be interested in the following pages:\nSee also:\n"}
{"BreakupBreakout": "When partnerships break up, the various members of the former group don't always follow the same career path. A Breakup Breakout occurs when one or more members of a dissolved group achieve noteworthy success while other members of the group languish. This can cause all sorts of awkwardness, jealousy and resentment amongst the former colleagues.\nIt is very common after TV shows end for one cast member to go on to continued success while the others fade into obscurity. See also The Band Minus the Face, Breakout Character, More Popular Spinoff, and Ensemble Dark Horse. Contrast with The Pete Best, who is remembered, when they are remembered at all, for leaving (or being ejected from) such a partnership, which then goes on to achieve noteworthy success without them. Also contrast with Solo Side Project, which is where a band member works on solo projects without actually leaving the band (or before a break-up).\n"}
{"AccentSlipUp": "When a character is known to speak in one dialect or accent, but under certain situations (such they're just mediocre at keeping the acquired accent up or they're stressed) their accent slips. This is usually Played for Laughs but can be Played for Drama if they fake their accent to fit in or hide their background.\nThis is different from Ooh, Me Accent's Slipping in that it's an in-universe trope. Instead of the voice actor or actor accidentally changing accents at random intervals, the character canonically slips their accent. Occasionally this is used as a reason to explain an actors poor ability at keeping an accent, however it's more commonly intentional.\nWhen a spy character who has been faking an accent permanently reverts to their real accent, that's an Accent Relapse.\nAnime & Manga\nComic Books\nFan Works\nFilm -- Animated\nFilm \u2014 Live Action\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\n Newspaper Comics\n Video Games\n Visual Novels\nWeb Comics\n Web Original\n Western Animation\n"}
{"MageMarksman": "Combining swordplay and sorcery is a viable strategy in your Standard Fantasy Setting, but perhaps this magic wielding character prefers to engage enemies at a distance to use their Improbable Aiming Skills. Or perhaps this character lives in a setting where Fantasy Gun Control isn't in effect and swords are obsolete. Enter the Mage Marksman.\nThe Mage Marksman comes in mainly two flavors:\nCompare Magic Knight and Kung-Fu Wizard, wherein the character uses a sword or their bare hands alongside magic. See also Postmodern Magik. Not to be confused with Depleted Phlebotinum Shells, where the weapons or bullets themselves are magically enhanced, though a character who fights like this may well combine these tropes.\n"}
{"AManOfWealthAndTaste": "If there's a deliciously evil male villain, he's going to be a well-dressed villain. He'll wear a sharp-looking suit. Silk tie, expensive shirt, exquisitely ironed pants, tailored jacket, leather belt and tasteful accessories. Always perfectly in fashion. Bonus points if it's a monochrome suit, and extra-special bonus points if it's a black monochrome suit.\nTurns out, evil has quite a lot of money and excellent fashion sense. The villain might well brag about the kickass English or Italian suit he had tailored, possibly during a Mob-Boss Suit Fitting. It's very common for the Corrupt Corporate Executive.\nWhen your evil mook uniforms are made by Hugo Boss, this is Putting on the Reich.\nSub-Trope of Evil Is Cool and Sharp-Dressed Man, and Sister Trope to Badass in a Nice Suit, and Man in White.\nSee also Wicked Cultured, and A Glass of Chianti.

{"FilibusterFreefall": "Art tends to draw fringe personalities. Be they left-wing or right-wing, sexually liberated or restrictive, bearing funny ideas on everything from drugs to health care to the wearing of funny hats on Sundays, creative types usually have their ideas and stick to them. Usually, however, they manage to stay separate from the work, or if they're worked in, they're blended in a way that adds to the quality of the work or at least doesn't detract from the main thrill ride.\nThere are some cases, however, where a strange combination of the author's prestige, personal life, and political bent causes things to take a strong shift. Suddenly, you're cracking open the latest book in a rollicking fantasy series and there's a hundred page section on how people wearing funny hats on Sunday should be sentenced to death by firing squad. Where once there was flirting, things have gotten overtly bohemian and even hideously porny. Where once there was fun military action, there are now long sections on the moral failings of the Clinton Administration. Something has cracked, and the author has ended up firmly in Filibuster Freefall.\nThe phenomenon was first noted by author James Nicoll on the rec.arts.sf newsgroup (and we're actually citing him properly this time) and dubbed \"The Brain Eater\" (not to be confused with the trope about eating brains) in relation to authors Poul Anderson and James P. Hogan. It is a certain form of Protection from Editors which allows the author to freely enter Author Tract territory or spout off on their views without fear of repercussion. For interest of clarification, it does not apply to authors such as China Mi\u00e9ville or Ayn Rand, who have always discoursed on their political positions in their works (socialism and Objectivism respectively). For Filibuster Freefall to apply, the author has to have started off writing in a neutral, if slightly charged, manner before reaching a point where the messages are obviously being shouted in your ear to the exclusion of all else. As this is no doubt a charged topic, poster discretion is advised.\nIf this is limited to one work or series rather than the author's entire body of work, the work has suffered Issue Drift. This may be the reason for Seasonal Rot.\n"}
{"LegacyLaunch": "As mentioned elsewhere the Big Two comic book companies have a stable of characters with proven staying power culled from decades of trial and error but sometimes they want to launch a new character for various reasons. New characters tend to fail due to a combination of Sturgeon's Law and fandom's attachment to the existing vetted characters.\nLegacy Characters do inject fresh blood into a title sometimes but they only revitalize the existing franchises rather than creating new ones. The solution is the Legacy Launch. It works something like this.\nQuite often, the new identity will have a lot in common with the old one. Similar powers and tools, usually with a different personality. This character can sometimes be a Suspiciously Similar Substitute, or Expy, and sometimes is a Foil for the original. Younger and Hipper and Darker and Edgier seem to coincide with this trope too, probably because the original heroes are Silver Age and Golden Age creations.\nThe above steps are sometimes not intentional. For example, Bob could be killed and replaced by Dave to boost slumping sales only to provoke backlash from the loyal fans, so the old character is brought back only to provoke a similar backlash from David's new fandom making the creators turn to this trope as a compromise.\n"}
{"NoFlowPortal": "Portals are sometimes helpful. Sometimes they're unreliable, or dangerous. Sometimes, though, they're just weirdly selective.\nNo Flow Portal is a strange effect where a portal immersed in whatever medium \u2014 a liquid, like a body of water, or a different kind of atmosphere \u2014 or exposed to conditions which would otherwise affect the other side of the portal, for some reason doesn't let it through even when the portal is working. The Hero can swim into the portal on one side and walk out of it the other side, yet the body of water he swam in remains as stolidly fixed as if it were up against glass. The hero could even cause an explosion next to a portal, and the people on the other side won't even feel a breeze.\nThis trope isn't restricted to water, though water is one of the easiest ways to show it in action in fiction. Different atmospheric conditions can be strangely shy about crossing the portal barrier. This is obvious enough with two completely different atmospheres, but for a few more observant viewers, this trope may manifest itself in a case where the atmospheres are the same but one is blowing across or even into the portal on one side and having no effect on the other side. What you'd expect to happen in the former is that the air would get sucked through the portal as the wind creates an area of lower pressure in the other world. Even sand may fall victim to this trope - Sand Is Water, for a given definition of 'water' - though in this case the portal is more likely to be just partly submerged in the sand rather than completely smothered by it.\nThe opposite of this trope, naturally, would be where the conditions do affect things on the other side of the portal. A portal which lead straight to a Lethal Lava Land, for instance, would be pretty toasty on the other side if Convection Schmonvection was done away with. If combined with Time Travel, this trope's aversion is usually closely allied with San Dimas Time.\nSometimes, an inexplicably fierce whirlwind sucks in everything on one side of the portal. This is quite common in fantasy works where the portal in question leads to somewhere nefarious and supernatural, though it'll always be less about thermal currents and fluid dynamics and more about looking impressive - how else to make a portal look foreboding and scary?\nFor those of us who like to dwell on this sort of thing, it often leads to a Fridge Logic moment when you wonder why biological matter (which itself contains a lot of fluids, including water) can pass through but a body of water can't. MS T3k Mantra is usually enough to dismiss it.\nMay be justified by A Wizard Did It. Not to be confused with Portal Pool, which is where a body of water is the portal.\nFilm \u2014 Live-Action\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nTabletop Games\nVideo Games\nWeb Comics\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"Tradesnark": "A humorous way to make Things\u2122 stand out is to add Random Trademark Symbols\u00ae everywhere. May be used as a Social Commentary\u00ae on our increasingly homogenised, commercialised World\u00ae, but more often than not, done just because of the Rule of Funny\u2122. They can also be used in Sarcasm Mode (perhaps in conjunction with Scare Quotes) to passive-aggressively imply that something exists only as a Concept\u2122; for example, some people refer to \"Global Warming\u2122\". Another sarcastic variation is to sprinkle Trade Snark over your paraphrase of an opponent's position to imply that he's using the term in question as a meaningless buzzword\u00ae.\nFor added Spice\u2122, try adding Registered Trademark\u00ae and Copyright\u00a9 Symbols\u00ae\u00a9\u2122.

{"TheMightyDucks": "The Mighty Ducks movies were a popular series of films, reminiscent of The Bad News Bears, where a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits play hockey and get into various misadventures and manage to work things out just in time to win the championship game or whatever.\nThe Mighty Ducks animated series was, to put it gently, rather a surprise for viewers expecting a comedy series about misfit kids playing hockey and who instead got a cartoon about anthropomorphic alien ducks playing hockey \u2014 and fighting crime.\nThere's also an actual hockey team in the National Hockey League, which was called Mighty Ducks of Anaheim from its creation in 1993 until Disney (responsible for both the films and the TV series) sold the team in 2006 - it's been the Anaheim Ducks ever since.\n"}
{"BadAssGrandpa": "Old men are weak, right?\nWhen it comes to fiction, more often than not the oldest, apparently feeblest characters are the ones to be feared the most. They kick ass, take names, and can fend off armies single-handedly. If he's part of a Badass Family that has a Papa Wolf, this would be his Papa Wolf.\nOld men in a dangerous line of work have been doing it for a very long time, and only lived that long because they've been smarter and/or stronger than everyone they've faced. Additionally, in a Crapsack World, or when Earth Is a Battlefield, a man may well only live to be old if he is already very bad-ass to start with.\nYour badass old guy is likely to be tougher and cooler than just about everyone else, but given the subjective definition of the term Badass, it's just hard to define a trope that in theory could be any number of badass qualities matched with equally subjective old age where both aspects are relevant.\nHowever, we have singled a few out. Please direct appropriate wicks to the following tropes:\nIs often The Mentor on steroids. If it's an evil person that ruined countless lives and still survived, see Evil Old Folks.\n"}
{"RageJudo": "Alice confronts her husband Bob about an affair with Carol. Bob cannot refute her, so he says something that he knows will make her angry at someone else, then proceeds to watch while Alice rants or gets in a fight.\nBob has just played this on Alice. Basically, this trope is when two people are quarreling and one gets the other mad enough at a third party to escape any consequences. Manipulative Bastards tend to be fond of this, and Bob may be pressing Alice's Berserk Button\u2014but carefully enough that she doesn't go off on him. Compare Apple of Discord, which can achieve this less immediately but in greater scale.\n"}
{"BitByBitTransformation": "A type of transformation in which, most likely due to a curse, spell or potion, portions of your body start to turn into that of a creature until the whole body is changed. The order can vary depending on what animal or on the work. Often happens to a Baleful Polymorph.\n"}
{"MirrorUniverse": "Often a subset of Bizarro Universe, it is an Alternate Universe where Good and Evil characterisations are reversed, but is otherwise the same as the \"real\" universe - except where logically derived from this change in morality. As an example, in Bizarro World, the Earth is a cube. In the mirror universe, the earth is a sphere, but the Mirror Self of The Brigadier has a cool eyepatch.\nOccasionally, some other characteristic is reversed. The hero in the Mirror Universe functions as the Evil Twin. The Five-Man Band becomes The Psycho Rangers. Expect the loyal soldier to become a blithering coward, the backstabbing bastard to become a peaceful negotiator, and the bridge bunny who normally gets no lines to become a trash-talking, lingerie-wearing, gun-toting, bisexually hyperactive ball of unleashed id.\nThese mirror worlds tend to get popular with the fanbase, who'll eagerly come up with alternate versions of any character not yet shown, and as a result it'll often get returned to and expanded upon to please them. The status quo in the mirror universe is more likely to change than the original one, probably because the writers are allowed to do it.\nThe Trope Codifier is the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \"Mirror, Mirror.\" In homage to this episode, it's common for an evil mirror equivalent to have a goatee beard.\nContrast with Dark World. Not to be confused with Mirror World.\n"}
{"Hyperspace": "Subspace or Hyperspace are terms used in science fiction to describe certain forms of space that can do things impossible in regular space (see also Green Rocks).\nSubspace Subspace was popularized by Star Trek and is a trope for a form of space that has different physical properties from normal space and allows the Enterprise crew (and the writers) to do all sorts of things that have some degree of scientific \"consistency\" but can't actually happen in the real world. For example, generating a subspace field can alter the apparent mass of an object, allowing it to be moved more easily. It's also the basis of FTL Radio, which makes communications possible in ships that are moving faster than light (since real-life radio transmissions can only travel at light speed). It was used on Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine with regularity, often just to fill the Applied Phlebotinum slot for the episode. Star Trek: Voyager took this to silly extremes-at least one episode referenced hypersubspace. Your guess as to what that means is as good as ours.\nBefore there was Star Trek, Golden Age science fiction would sometimes include references to \"sub-etheric\" communications or waves. The idea of the ether had already been disproved, but the term was useful for \"waves that behave kinda like light, only different.\"\nNot to be confused with the other subspace. Or with the other other subspace. Or with Sub Space.\nHyperspace In the real world, hyperspace refers to mathematical concepts involving more than 3 spatial dimensions. Hyperspace or hyperdrive is often used to describe Faster-Than-Light Travel or another dimension or other scifi concepts, and as such has been part of the SF lexicon at least since the pulp magazines of the 1930s. For example, in Star Wars, it is how starships achieve faster-than-light travel. Likewise, Babylon 5 uses a hyperspace, but with a far different set of rules and base technologies behind it.\nIf both terms are used in a story, then typically subspace will only allow data transmissions, but will carry them almost instantaneously. Hyperspace will be slower, but will at least temporarily allow matter (spaceships) to travel through it.\nThe name subspace seems to be taken from the subobjects of various mathematical spaces, such as vector spaces in linear algebra or metric and topological spaces in topology.\nThe name hyperspace was originally used to refer to vector spaces with more than three dimensions. Thus the origin of the hyperspace concept is probably linked to Another Dimension.\nSubtrope of Another Dimension. Hyperspace may or may not be a scary place. See also Hyperspace Index.\n"}
{"FleshEatingZombie": "Flesh-Eating Zombies are the type usually found in a Zombie Apocalypse. They consume the skin, brains, or various other organs of the living, and sometimes infect survivors, who become zombies themselves \u2014 which makes them a lot like a ghoul, really. Can also be merged with a Voodoo Zombie or Plague Zombie. They show a lot of the characteristics of the actual European folkloric vampire, before Gothic novelists made them sexier and cleverer.\nThis is one of the most common zombie tropes to be parodied; parody zombies always moan for brains, even though that specific form was never very common.\nContrast Friendly Zombie; Attractive Zombies also tend to avert this trope, due to Beauty Equals Goodness.\n"}
{"RationalFic": "A Rational Fic is one which makes a deliberate effort to reward a reader's thinking. It's the opposite of Bellisario's Maxim. The world-building is intended to stand up to careful thought; the plot is driven by characters or circumstances that themselves are part of the story, the heroes generally think clearly (in ways the reader can follow), and a clever reader can deduce what's hidden or what's coming. Very often, the fic is also intended to teach the reader something about rationality.\nOne of the first authors to use aspects of rational thinking and non-Aristotlian logic as the basis of their world-building and character interactions was A. E. van Vogt, specifically in the Null-A series. One of those authors who built upon the success of Van Vogt's works to arguably create the genre known as 'rational fiction' was Eliezer Yudkowsky, who wrote the popular piece of Harry Potter fanfiction Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality and put his own views on the subject into The Abridged Guide to Intelligent Characters. A sizeable community of people who write or enjoy this type of fiction exists on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational. Because HPMoR marked the emergence (or at least, codification) of the genre, the name uses Fic instead of fiction; some fans use the terms Rational Fiction, Rationalist Fic, and Rationalist Fiction interchangeably, though most use Fiction for published/non-derivative works, and Rationalist for works that not only aim for realistic intelligence, but try to teach principles of rationality.\nRational Fics often have these tropes as their foundation:\nTropes which are common in Rational Fic, but not as central:\nTropes which Rational Fic deliberately avoids:\nThe number of tropes Rational Fic attempts to avoid which are on the Bad Writing Index might suggest that it is some sort of universal principle of good writing, which is not the case. Even Those Tropes Are Not Bad, and many Rational Fics fail to avoid them in any case, or fall into other traps (Author Tract, Invincible Hero/Villain, ex.). The Lord of the Rings would not necessarily have benefited from a clearly explained magic system, nor The Threepenny Opera from a logical Downer Ending, nor The Dark Knight from making The Joker a Well-Intentioned Extremist.\nAlso note that the occasional appearance of a trope to avoid doesn't prevent the work from being Rational Fic, if it conforms to most of the other tropes.\nYou can also see this poll on the Facebook group \"Rational Fic\" where people have voted for their favorite stories. As of February 2019, the top 5 are: Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, Three Worlds Collide, Worm, Crystal Society, and The Metropolitan Man.\n"}
{"ExtendableArms": "Take a cartoon, preferably an older one, and find a pair who always end up in fights. Tom and Jerry, Dick Dastardly and Muttley from Wacky Races or virtually anyone from Looney Tunes. Somehow, one character always has a fist which can stretch across an entire country. Or a universe. This is a type of Toon Physics, and is often used with revenge. The inverse is when a character has extendable legs.\nNot to be confused with Rubber Man. Usually doesn't overlap with Creepily Long Arms, which are a permanent biological feature.\nNeeds a Better Description\n"}
{"NonHumansLackAttributes": "One of the common decency standards in comics, television, and other media is that aliens, monsters and other nonhuman creatures are never depicted with visible genitals, anuses, or nipples, even in scenes where such things should be plainly visible. This is helpful in conserving decency when the plot requires otherwise, but does the exact opposite if the nude in question is sufficiently humanoid, such as with anthropomorphic animals or mutants, especially if they also possess certain other features like Non-Mammal Mammaries (which tend to come with the suggestion of breasts instead of actual ones) and/or are normally expected to wear clothes. Even when Censor Steam or dark shadows are present to preserve decency, a silhouette or outline of the character may reveal that there is... something missing....\nIn most cases, this concession of realism is a subtle form of censorship \u2014 not necessarily at the insistence of meddling managers or Moral Guardians, but also because not every artist wants to actually think about such anatomical details themselves, nudity taboo or otherwise. (It's too easy to joke about what could be misheard from the art department: \"Bill, do these balls look right to you?\" \"Yeah, they're fine. Stop playing with them and work on the legs.\")\nIt's also a function of the Law of Conservation of Detail, especially in literature where it is merely left to the reader's imagination instead of being explicitly pointed out by the narrator; indeed, it's rare to see anyone actually address the subject onscreen. If this subject is addressed, there are a few stock explanations that are used to explain it. The most common assumption is that the details are logically present, but are obscured beneath a layer of body fur or other Bizarre Alien Biology or, more usually, is simply not important to the situation/storyline/characters/audience (delete as applicable).\nThe nipples variant involves a Civilized Animal, Funny Animal, or Petting Zoo Person who has at least some definition to her chest, but who doesn't have any visible nipples. They have either a subtle or distinct \"puffing\" to the chest, a suggestion of breasts, or flat-out breasts. This can be justified if the nipples are hidden under the fur. This can be as much due to the Law of Conservation of Detail as censorship, especially for male animals because male nipples are not typically seen as taboo.\nOne way to subvert the genitalia side on a Civilized Animal, Funny Animal, or Petting Zoo Person is to give the character shaggier fur around the pelvic area. This simply implies that the character has genitalia, but their fur is covering it.\nA subtrope of Anatomy Anomaly. Compare Animals Lack Attributes for anatomy (genital, anus, and nipple) censorship as it applies to (otherwise normal, real-life) animals in fiction, and Barbie Doll Anatomy for the censorship of humans. See also No Biological Sex, Funny Animal Anatomy, Ambiguous Gender, and Exposed Extraterrestrials. Contrast with Monster Modesty, where creatures wear shorts or other coverings even when it seems unlikely they would need to.\nFur Is Clothing, Removable Shell, and Eggshell Clothing (these usually being Played for Laughs) are a few ways it can be averted.\n"}
{"CrimeReconstruction": "On many a True Crime show (e.g. The First 48) and \"help us solve crime X\" programs (e.g. America's Most Wanted, Crimewatch UK) or even on the National or Local News real crimes are acted out on screen for the viewer. Either by actors or by the actual victims with the perpetrators played by actors.\nThis is to help the viewer visualize the situation which might be otherwise tricky if there are a lot of details to take in in a relatively short amount of time. It can also just be used as filler in some shows. Sometimes these aren't the most tasteful things in the world in the cases of unsolved crimes. They retell the story melodramatically but in a way that prompts the viewer to enjoy the thrill of the gruesome crime and the knowledge that the culprit is still free.\nWhile crimes are by far the most common thing to be given this treatment they aren't the only thing. Accidents may be dramatized this way, especially on \"heroes of the emergency services\" shows like the now defunct UK show 999. Historical events like battles often get this treatment in documentaries too.\nSee also Dramatization.\n"}
{"NoDamageRun": "A variation of the Self-Imposed Challenge where the goal is to win with no damage, or at least no deaths (which is commonly referred to as \"Hardcore Mode\" and is sometimes directly supported as part of the game's coding). This usually requires a lot of experience with the game in question, and due to the randomness/unpredictability of many games it can be very challenging, if not impossible. Virtually impossible in RPGs (due to Random Encounters and Scratch Damage), for example, and exceedingly difficult in the higher levels of Fighting Games (where someone is bound to hit you once with a weak punch) and First Person Shooters.\nSome Nintendo Hard games required the player to perform No Damage Runs as a matter of course. This also boils down to making your run entirely of Flawless Victories.\nMany tool-assisted Speedruns are also No Damage Runs, since the player can control the character precisely and manipulate random events in his favor. You'd think it would be \"most\", but taking damage or even dying actually saves time in many games, thanks to Mercy Invincibility and the often-resulting knockback from taking damage which usually ends up being the fastest way to move or respawn points strewn across long travel distances, so they can be used for Sequence Breaking.\nA variation common among Shoot-em-ups in particular is the 1CC, or \"1 Credit Clear\", meaning that the game is completed without continuing (dying is still permissible). Given that Shoot-em-ups will often provide the player with infinite continues, and that each credit has finite lives, most fans agree that to claim to have beaten a shmup requires a No Continue Run. A No Death Run (aka 1LC, \"1 Life Clear\" or \"No Miss Clear\"note\u00a0\"miss\" is a sort of Engrish shorthand for \"mistakes,\" not \"missed shots\" or \"missiles\") is even more impressive, especially considering that most Shoot-em-ups have the player as a One-Hit-Point Wonder. This is where most Bullet Hell games get their difficulty from.\nIn Rhythm Games, hitting successive notes accumulates a combo; thus, a No Damage Run of a whole stage is known as a \"Full Combo\", or FC.\nIf a No Damage Run is too much for you, you can instead strive for a No Death Run or a No Continue Run, or select Final Death Mode as a difficulty level for an in-game No Death Run. If the goal is to deal no damage, see Pacifist Run.\n"}
{"TomboyAndGirlygirl": "When the main characters in a show are both female, or if there are only Two Girls to a Team, it almost always leads to a case of this trope. The \"Girly Girl\" will highly care about her appearance, pursue \"girly\" interests, and is often (though not always) The Chick. The Tomboy, who is often The Big Girl, will be into sports, mechanics, or the like. She couldn't care less about her hair or makeup, but is often an Unkempt Beauty anyway. Like their spear counterparts (Sensitive Guy and Manly Man), they are candidates for an Odd Couple and Odd Friendship brought together in the attempt to make hilarity ensue.\nThe two ladies will have some sort of relationship with each other, whether they're best friends, sisters, on the same team, or even explicit lovers. Even when they aren't explicit lovers, this may lead to deliberate or accidental Homoerotic Subtext due to the overlap with the Masculine\u2013Feminine Gay Couple stereotype. If they're together for reasons outside their control (i.e., part of a team), they might initially dislike or confuse each other with their ways, until the inevitable Girls' Night Out Episode forces them to put aside their differences and forge a common bond (note: if there are more than two girls in the group, these two must have some kind of relationship over the others). When one is the mother of the other, the mother will almost always be the girly girl.\nIt may lead to Fan Dumb or Hate Dumb if one is portrayed as being \"better\" than the other, if the girly girl is portrayed as shallow or less of a strong woman, or if the tomboy is portrayed as a cold man hater or even ambiguously lesbian for taking a less traditional gender role. Works that involve Values Dissonance are particularly vulnerable to this. At its most extreme it reinforces the Men Are Generic, Women Are Special mindset, where males on the team have varied personalities unrelated to their gender (due to maleness being seen as worthless) while the females are defined by their femininity or lack thereof (thus limiting their characterization and role variety).\nCompare the mannish one and the sweet-naive one of the Four-Girl Ensemble.\nCompare/contrast Bifauxnen and Lad-ette (the equivalent of this trope, only without said girly girl involved), Light Feminine and Dark Feminine (the other equivalent, usually without the tomboy), and Masculine\u2013Feminine Gay Couple (an equivalent involving a couple). Contrast Silk Hiding Steel, Spirited Young Lady, Girly Bruiser and often Pretty Princess Powerhouse; all of which are mixture of the two. When a third girl is part of the dynamic, a girl that does not fit in either category then is among the Town Girls (Butch, Femme and Neither).\nImportant Note: While this is usually a straightforward trope, examples can still get subjective in regards to whether or not one of the girls is tomboyish enough, the other is girly enough, or whether they're different enough. Keep a few points in mind when editing;\n"}
{"BullyingTheDisabled": "An easy way to make a character a loathesome character is to have them ostracize or tease someone with a (usually physical) disability. Most bullies wouldn't mock someone for having a disability \u2014 it's seen as too mean to mock someone who is \"helpless\" or someone who has an issue they have no control over \u2014 so only the most cruel characters do. Usually only younger characters act this way, however adults and even parents are also known to.\nCompare to Bury Your Disabled. Sub-trope to Kick the Dog and Moral Event Horizon. May be a reason for the disabled character Hiding the Handicap.\n"}
{"YeOldeNuclearSilo": "Every so often in Science Fiction that takes place in the Near Future or at least the not so distant future, there will be rebels, and all rebels need a suitable hideout. Maybe there's an abandoned warehouse or an empty cave, but that's only for rebels who don't have it in them to be a real rebel army.\nIf you're about to tell the evil government or the alien invaders who's about to be in charge here, you need a base that really brings the message around.\nYou need Ye Olde Nuclear Silo. Originally created in the Cold War or in preparation for World War III, nuclear silos provide everything a real rebel army needs: It's a miniature military base removed from larger settlements and hidden from most observers in the sky, has all the pipes and cables for the industrial feeling, and those gigantic, slow-moving doors! It usually comes conveniently with fully functioning computer equipment since it was already designed to survive armageddon, and it also provides that cozy damp cave atmosphere. If you're really lucky, it may even come with a functional missile and warhead.\nNote that this trope extends to cover pretty much any other type of small secret underground military installations. If the lair is more expansive, it's an Elaborate Underground Base. If it's taken over by civilians, it may become an Underground City.\n"}
{"IfYouEverHurtHer": "The common trope way to concede defeat in vying for a girl's heart is to tell the winner that, if he ever screws up, he should expect an ass-kicking of epic proportions. Usually uttered by (or sometimes to) The Lancer or The Rival.\nThis establishes that the loser:\nThe trope thing for the winner to do is to accept this statement amicably. \"I would be disappointed if you didn't.\" This is not (usually) an insult or a threat, but an agreement between guys who both want the same girl to be happy.\nThis can also be said by a parent or older brother of the girl, who is relinquishing their previous role as \"main male protector.\" But while this is generally a male-character trope, there are plenty of exceptions (sorted by gender in the examples).\nAnd yes, an asskicking of epic proportions will follow should any betrayal occur.\nMale Warning Male\nFemale Warning Male\nMale Warning Female\nFemale Warning Female\n"}
{"UnnecessaryMakeOver": "The YMMV variation of Beautiful All Along. You take your standard Hollywood Homely ugly-duckling, have her lose her glasses, take her hair out of that bun, and throw her in some fashionable clothes. Immediately the love interest begins goggling at the new-found beauty because hey, She Cleans Up Nicely.\nBut... the audience just doesn't buy it.\nMaybe it's because the audience thinks Nerds Are Sexy, or that they identify as a fellow nerd with said character. Maybe it's because the character has unintentionally traded in her Hot Librarian and Meganekko cred for a blander type of attractiveness. Maybe the girl was a happy quirky non-conformist who, by selling out to society's vision of beauty, proves herself to be a less-interesting Rule-Abiding Rebel. Maybe the makeover hasn't aged well because her original \"dull\" look was more simple and timeless, whereas her new ultra-trendy look fell victim to Fashion Dissonance and is now ridiculously dated. It could also be that there is an assumption that without make-up and having frazzled hair anyone will look unattractive, not realizing they are evoking an Unkempt Beauty. It usually boils down to, she was never all that ugly to begin with.\nIn any case, the reaction is the same: \"Why did they change her? I LIKED HER BETTER BEFORE!\"\nBecause mainstream fiction pays much less attention to the attractiveness and fashion choices of male characters than female ones, male characters are less likely to get makeovers at all, and this trope largely applies to female ones.\nThis often applies to real life celebrities getting plastic surgery, with many fans saying they preferred the old face over the new one, especially if the celeb was already attractive to begin with. Whatever flaws they had\u2014including aging\u2014simply made them look like a human being as opposed to an artificial doll of perfect beauty, which tends to make viewers uncomfortable more often than not. It can even affect their work if they get rid of whatever facial quirks made them so distinct in the first place, as Jennifer Grey from Dirty Dancing found out the hard way.\nVery likely to cause a Family-Unfriendly Aesop concerning standards of beauty. See also: Just the Way You Are, for a similar reaction in-story, which is probably also a Femininity Failure for her. Can be a result of Unkempt Beauty. See also Fans Prefer the New Her where the opposite happens \u2014 the characters hate the makeover but the fans prefer it.\n"}
{"PrecursorHero": "A hero or group of heroes (often oddly similar to your own Player Party) that arose in the hour of need and sealed the Ultimate Evil in its can 1,000 years ago. Often shows up in As Long as There is Evil or similar scenario (like the aforementioned Sealed Evil in a Can) where the evil recurs.\nMay be the sire of the hero's Heroic Lineage and original bearer of the Ancestral Weapon. If they're literal precursors, can be an example of Generation Xerox.\nCompare Legacy of the Chosen and contrast Predecessor Villain.\n"}
{"BreadAndCircus": "Evil governments are allowed to be evil because they appeal to the needs and desires of the general populace.\nThe workers all get paid, everyone has enough to eat, and The Trains Run on Time. And it's not a Lotus-Eater Machine or an especially efficient Propaganda Machine; the stuff is real. As a consequence, as long as the people are contented, who's going to care about petty things like restrictions of basic freedom, environmental destruction, WMD research, or random abductions...\n... right?\nThe trope name (Latin: Panem et Circenses) comes from Roman poet Juvenal's metaphor for people voluntarily (or democratically) giving up civic responsibility for a reasonably stable status quo (the 'circus' in question being an arena for spectator sports like races and Gladiator Games). When the people are well-fed and having fun, they will be too contented or lazy to protest against those in charge (they may even start to thank, adore, and praise those in charge), turning them into Gullible Lemmings and Apathetic Citizens who will leave the Powers That Be free to do as they please. These societies tend to be run by Totalitarian Utilitarians and/or Corrupt Corporate Executives, but bread and circuses can exist in whatever form of government, even in democracies and \"utopias.\"\nIt's not like the leaders are running a Lotus-Eater Machine or simply covering up the destitute, either. For examples to qualify, both the food and the fun have to be real. Where they come from or what they cover up will be the thing The Hero sets out to expose.\nThis situation also sets up conflict for a hero who sees the evil of those in power, because as far as the neighbors are concerned, the hero is simply a rebel or a troublemaker out to ruin their (relatively) happy life \u2014 or worse, submerge them in fire and brimstone. Too much focus on the contentment of the people may also lessen audience sympathy for the hero; sometimes, this is even the correct thing, because the hero really will cause more trouble than he fixes.\nThere are three primary reasons for this conflict:\nIf The Hero is forming La R\u00e9sistance or fighting in it, he regards the first as manipulation, and the second and third as simply wrong. If, on the other hand, he is not trying to bring down the government and this issue comes up, often enough he offers these reasons himself. Indeed, this trope may slide indetectibly into Reasonable Authority Figure, as the repressive measures are deployed against real threats \u2014 particularly if Hobbes Was Right.\nAnother conflict that may ensue from Bread and Circuses is the blurring of the distinctions between Dystopia and Utopia. After all, one author's utopian Sugar Bowl is another author's dystopian Bread and Circuses Crapsaccharine World.\nThe nastier, more blatantly dystopian sorts provide Blood Sport and Gladiator Games - or, God forbid, Public Execution, for the amusement, while the general population, of course, knows this, but doesn't care. After all, either the savages who participate in such things probably can't appreciate true civilization anyway or they probably deserved it for ''some'' reason, one way or another. A more benevolent ruler might arrange a formal, organized tournament and even participate in it.\nThis trope is always present in a Crapsaccharine World. Can overlap with Strawman News Media and Network Decay.\nThis is related to the Marxist concept of the Dominant Ideology, whereby the lower classes are kept in place by disseminating the idea that that's their \"natural\" lot in life and there's no sense fighting it.\n"}
{"ThatOneBoss": "There are many different categories of bosses, some more memorable than others. There's the Warmup Boss, the Giant Space Flea from Nowhere, the Climax Boss, the Final Boss... And then there's this boss.\nThat One Boss is, well, that one boss that falls victim to poor playtesting or was thrown in by especially cruel developers. You're leveling up normally, plowing through every battle, until you reach this particular battle and suddenly meet a nasty road block. Eventually, you Rage Quit, or you go on the Internet looking for assistance. In the event that you stop by the game's message board, lo and behold, everyone else is having the exact same problem, with entire topics asking \"how do I beat That One Boss?\". Walkthroughs usually list the worst offenders as \"the hardest boss in the game\", and eventually, such a beast receives a reputation for being just that freaking hard. A few of them may be awesome, but that still doesn't mean you won't be chewing on the controller in frustration despite it.\nCertain types of boss are not usually included in this consideration right off the bat: The Final Boss, Wake-Up Call Boss, and Bonus Boss. People expect the Final Boss to be tough (Well, usually), and the Bonus Boss is usually included solely to be an extra challenge that\u2019s too difficult for the main game. Players will prepare for the Bonus Boss by overleveling, but for maximum frustration, That One Boss needs only to just show up out of nowhere, preferably having no place in the storyline beforehand.\nThey usually show up in Role-Playing Games, though they're not exclusive to them. Game designers will sometimes go out of their way to put them in, serving as a bottleneck to make sure you spend a couple hours Level Grinding before you go on to the next area.\nOccasionally, the identity of That One Boss varies depending on an individual's playing style\u2014bosses are often designed to have issues with one particular strategy, so one that requires another strategy can seriously hinder a gamer if they're not prepared to switch up their tactics. Please take a second before adding examples to make sure the issue is actually with the boss and not that your tactical decisions were just poor\u2014if it's hard because it requires strategies you wouldn't have thought of then that can qualify, but if it's just because you hadn't mastered regular blocking timings or got the wrong end of the Elemental Rock\u2013Paper\u2013Scissors system then please refrain. However, any easy tactics like Outside-the-Box Tactic disqualify a boss from being That One Boss... unless the 'tactic' itself is impossible to find.\nIf the game has multiple difficulty levels, maybe the boss is hard on all difficulty levels, not just the hardest one. You might be up against a particular boss on Easy, but the difficulty of the boss is comparable to the average boss on Normal, or worst-case scenario, the boss may as well belong on Hard difficulty.\nThey are sometimes called the \"brick wall boss\", for obvious reasons.\nCompare Demonic Spiders, which is more That One Random Encounter, as well as the Boss in Mook Clothing (we'll leave it up to you to decide which is worse). Most likely to be the one to use That One Attack. For maximum frustration, have it be the boss of That One Level. See also That One Sidequest. Contrast Anti-Climax Boss, where the boss is underpowered/easy despite the story building them up as a powerful opponent. Direct inverse of Breather Boss, where the boss is just pathetically easy unintentionally. For bosses that are not technically difficult, but are downright frustrating, see Goddamned Boss. For bosses that are deliberately impossible to beat, see Hopeless Boss Fight. If you're looking to read up on unfair bosses that the game seems to deliberately give every known advantage to, requiring you to either get by on luck or cheap gameplay, head on over to SNK Boss. That page is for brokenness\u2014this is just plain hard.\nTo sum it up; if the boss is difficult when you first get to him, but easier on further playthroughs when you get enough skill (or understanding of the needed mechanics), it is merely a Wake-Up Call Boss. If it requires a very unusual tactic to win, but dies easily to it, that is Outside-the-Box Tactic. If the boss isn't technically hard to beat, but doing it is such a slog that you still hate doing it, it's Goddamned Boss. It has to be much harder than expected for that point in the game, and remain that way every time you replay the game to qualify as That One Boss. In other words, this is the boss whose battle will haunt your nightmares every time you see their image or hear their name.\nIt is useful to note that, as its name implies, most videogames only have one That One Boss. If a game appears to have several candidates for the title\u2014especially if every boss battle feels this way\u2014you are probably looking at Easy Levels, Hard Bosses, or a game that is just plain Nintendo Hard. In fact, if anything, a generally easy game will be more vulnerable to this trope, as while hard games will have expectedly hard bosses, it can be a shock to play a comparatively effortless game and come across a boss where you have to be on your toes for once.\nNOTE: Final Boss and Wake-Up Call Boss cannot be That One Boss without being overly hard by their standards. An Early Bird Boss will almost always qualify as That One Boss as well, but for reasons of the player's weakness rather than the boss's strength.\nBecause there are so many examples of this trope, they have been categorized by genre for your viewing convenience.\nCompare with the non-video game equivalent of this trope, Invincible Villain.\n"}
{"EyebrowsBurnedOff": "Whenever fire or explosions are involved, the first thing to go is inevitably the eyebrows. This is nearly always Played for Laughs. This is usually a good way to have people hit by fire come away without true injuries in comedic works.\nIn Real Life, eyebrows do get singed off fairly readily in the case of flame, due to being fairly prominent on the face and thinner than normal hair. However, singed eyebrows may accompany more serious burns as well, so Don't Try This at Home.\nSee also Playing with Fire, Kill It with Fire, or Ash Face. Compare Close-Call Haircut.\n"}
{"LetsSeeYouDoBetter": "Complaining About Shows You Don't Like can be fun. Picking apart works and trying to find and explain (and make fun of) some of the things that went wrong can be deeply satisfying, and at the same time strangely therapeutic. Of course, some people take some of these criticisms to heart, and won't hesitate to chew you out if you suggest that something may be wrong with their personal Sacred Cow. That person will usually rebut your criticism with something like, 'Oh, yeah? Let's see you do better!'\nThere is a common misconception among fans and people having worked in a particular field that non-experts are not qualified to comment on their work. While it helps to have some background information or experience, it is certainly not required. It doesn't take a carpenter to recognize a poorly-made table, after all. (Helpful hint: if a table spontaneously falls apart, things probably didn't go according to procedure.). And besides, films are usually made to entertain audiences, so of course it is acceptable for people to have opinions over which movies fail to accomplish this. And even if it wasn't made for your demographic, then that does not exempt it from criticism either. Sort of like Godwin's Law, except usually without the invocation of Hitler (see below). Targets for Snark Bait are especially vulnerable to this phenomenon, as is the person with a Small Name, Big Ego. Let's all remember what Baldassere Castiglione said in The Courtier:\nJust imagine if this were applied to all forms of criticism: 'You think I don't do a good job raising my own children, and you think their grandparents should handle them? How can you even say that when you've never been a parent?' 'You think this cake tastes bad and is undercooked? How can you even say that when you've never been a chef?' 'You think Hitler could have done a better job during World War II? How can you even say that when you've never been a leader of Germany who sparked a war and a Holocaust?' Clearly, you need not be good at something yourself in order to be able to tell whether someone else is good or not. This objection is rarely (if ever) raised to deflect positive criticism, but very few people are particularly inclined to reject positive criticism or praise in the first place, regardless of the source.\nOn the other hand, while all opinions may be valid, this does not mean that all opinions are equally informed or useful. Film criticism is a mix of opinion over what makes a good movie and objective facts about the movie presented. This means that getting the details wrong can undermine the quality of a review. For instance, somebody might mistakenly assume a trope is being played straight when the opposite might be true. This legitimately affects the credibility of the reviewer and the review, since it suggests that they simply weren't paying full attention, or even that they may be a Know-Nothing Know-It-All.\nFurthermore it is often much easier to sit back and criticise someone else's creation from the sidelines than it is to create something yourself, and it is not rare for criticism to form even without any rudimentary understanding of the difficulties inherent in producing whatever is being criticised. While anyone who's read a book or seen a movie is instantly capable of determining whether they like it or not, it's not always as easy to understand the challenges and difficulties that exist in creating a work of art without trying it for yourself. While having attempted to, say, write a novel doesn't guarantee that you will enjoy every novel you ever read, it does mean that you will have some better understanding of how novels are constructed (and how hard they can be to construct) than someone who has not, which can in turn inform your review.\nIt should also be remembered that in many cases creative works are, at least in part, the creator's personal expression and thus something they're likely to be very close to and emotional about. As such, a lot of time when a creator tries to deploy this trope, it is often an emotional reaction rather than a strictly logical one. Whether the criticism is valid or not (especially if valid in some cases), it can be disheartening for a creator to have their hard work casually and bluntly dismissed by someone with no experience of what it took to produce it, thus making this response perhaps understandable, if not exactly admirable. At the very least, informed criticism is usually aware of when genuine effort has (or has not) been made in trying to achieve something and is willing to acknowledge that effort, even if it didn't pay off, rather than dismissing the entire thing out of hand.\nThis argument legitimately comes into play when someone actually is coming out and saying they could do better without producing any evidence to that effect; in such cases, it's not unreasonable to ask them to put their money where their mouth is and pony up the goods.\nIn some circles, this is erroneously called \"Ebert's Law\", named after the famous film critic Roger Ebert. This is not an actual trope about his version of Ebert's Law, which is \"It's not what a movie's about, but how it's about it.\"\n'Those who can, do; those who can't, criticize,' is also a common variant. A form of circumstantial Ad Hominem. Compare with Don't Like, Don't Read (when this trope is applied to Fan Fic), and Hire the Critic (which sometimes happens in order to test their challenge). Also compare Correction Bait and He Panned It, Now He Sucks!. An Older Than Radio example is Benjamin Disraeli's remark that the ranks of critics are drawn from those who have failed at literature and the arts. (Disraeli earned his living as a novelist.)\nA specific case where the trope can be applied with impunity is when the critic claims 'Everyone can do better' or something to the tune, directly claiming a group they could belong in indeed can do better.\nThe most feared response to this statement is 'You wanna bet?'\nThe idea that you need some expertise in a subject matter in order to adequately judge and criticize it is actually substantially true; scientific studies have found that the ability to do some task correlates directly with your ability to comment on, criticize, and judge the performance of others usefully. This is known as the Dunning-Kruger Effect; people who are bad at performing a task not only are incapable of judging how well others do on it, but are incapable of judging how good they themselves are at the task at hand and will frequently wildly overestimate their own ability not only to do the task at hand, but to judge the capabilities of others.\nNot to be confused with Captain Pike's Dare to Be Badass issued to the young Jim Kirk.\n"}
{"KillemAll": "When Anyone Can Die becomes \"Everyone Will Die\".\nMany series are noteworthy for the extremely high body count among the main cast that they rack up in their last few episodes. In some cases, all of the heroes make a Heroic Sacrifice, or otherwise find themselves wearing the Red Shirt. Occasionally, the protagonists simply fail to prevent The End of the World as We Know It, resulting in a Downer Ending. (Possibly Dying Alone to cap it all.)\nCompare Everybody's Dead, Dave, where everybody except the main characters are dead. If just one person survives, it's Sole Survivor or Final Girl. Compare the Climactic Battle Resurrection. Also compare the Bolivian Army Ending, only we actually see the attack of the Bolivian Army. Also see Dwindling Party, where the cast is killed off one by one from the start. When a Sudden Downer Ending is planned from the start, it usually happens this way.\nUsually, however, either they accomplish something in death, such as killing the Big Bad and thus preventing The Bad Guy Wins, or it becomes clear that likeable as they may be, the world is better off without them, or their deaths are clearly an escape from a Fate Worse than Death. If none of these happens, and they prove completely ineffectual in both life and death, it's a Shoot the Shaggy Dog ending.\nIn a Prequel, they may be Doomed by Canon: all characters who do not appear in the sequel and can not be disposed of otherwise will have to die.\nIn Tabletop Games, this is called a Total Party Kill. Game Masters who are really annoyed with their group (or just sadistic) may invoke Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies.\nA short historical digression: the words \"Caedite eos, novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius\" (Latin: \"Kill them all, for God knows which are his,\" popularly rendered as \"Kill 'em all, and let God sort 'em out.\") are attributed to Abbot Arnold Amaury before the massacre of B\u00e9ziers during the Albigensian Crusade \u2014 albeit not in any of the numerous contemporary accounts of it. This was only attributed to him twenty years later as something he \"reportedly\" said.\nThe Trope Namer is Yoshiyuki Tomino, the Gundam creator who was given the nickname \"Kill 'Em All Tomino\" because of his reputation for producing anime where he kills off a large number of characters, often due to bouts of depression in his own life.\nThe funny thing about this particular trope, however, is that knowing that everyone dies is somehow much less spoiler-ish than knowing that, say, only your favorite one does. The wonders of perception... as some guy once allegedly said, \"The death of one man is a tragedy; the death of millions is a statistic.\"\nSee also Suicide Mission, Gotta Kill Em All, Final Solution, and Omnicidal Maniac (for whom \"killing 'em all\" is his goal). Contrast Everybody Lives.\nNot to be confused with the 2012 martial-arts movie Kill 'Em All or Metallica's debut album.\nNote: This is a Spoilered Rotten trope, that means that EVERY SINGLE EXAMPLE on this list is a spoiler by default and most of them will be unmarked. This is your last warning, only proceed if you really believe you can handle this list.\n"}
{"IOSGames": "Games (and similar apps) that can be played on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. A subset of Mobile Phone Games.\nHere divided into three categories:\nMost iOS devices (at least after the second generation iPod touch) share several characteristics: the most important are the accelerometer/tilt sensor and the touch screen. Many games for the platform are designed to use the accelerometer as a primary control. For example, driving games such as Pole Position Remix often have the player tilt the entire unit in lieu of providing a steering wheel, and other games use it to control an object's movement around the screen, such as a marble in a maze. The touchscreen also makes games involving tracing pathways (similar to many Nintendo DS games) possible alongside old-school PDA tap-and-drag games. The system's API (Cocoa Touch) is similar, but not identical, to the Cocoa toolkit used on macOS X, and uses the same XCode environment as Mac developers use.\nApple traditionally has somewhat of a love-hate relationship with the gaming community, going back to the first Mac and Steve Jobs' insistence that it be treated as a serious business machine. Though the Mac game market flourished in spite of Apple's ambivalence, games like Marathon and Glider that should have been world-shaking... weren't. For years, Apple's half-assed Pippin console was their only real attempt to court the game market...until the second generation iPod Touch came out. At this point, Apple decided to start leveraging the accelerometers they'd built into late-model MacBooks, which people had subsequently hacked into game controllers. Apple gave the Touch, followed by the next generation of iPhone, similar accelerometers, and positioned the Touch explicitly as a gaming system. Unrestricted by the licensing and hardware barriers of the Nintendo DS and Playstation Portable, game developers (especially small ones) responded in droves, making an Apple platform a serious contender in the gaming world for the first time since the Apple ][ line wound down.\nWhat role, if any, iOS gaming will play in the next generation of Console Wars is unclear. Whether casual gamers play iOS (or other smartphone games) exclusively or overlap with other, already identified groups \u2014 or if casual players transition to console games after becoming addicted via an iOS port or mini-game \u2014 is the major question of the smartphone gaming market. With the release of the third-generation iPad and improvements in graphics across the entire \"i\"-product line, some publishers have begun testing the market for \"serious games\" via the App Store (The World Ends with You being one prominent example). Apple now spotlights these releases, in a bit of historical irony, but whether or not i-gaming makes you a \"gamer\" is a question beyond the scope of TVTropes. Mobile technology is advancing at a rapid rate- to date, advanced graphics technology allows iOS games to sport almost current-gen console quality graphics (on newer iOS devices).\nSee also Android Games for the other major smartphone/tablet platform.\n"}
{"StarOfBethlehem": "The Star of Bethlehem, also called the Christmas Star, is a star in Christian tradition that revealed the birth of Jesus to the magi (or \"wise men\") and later led them to Bethlehem. According to the Gospel of Matthew, the magi were men \"from the east\" who were inspired by the appearance of the star to travel to Jerusalem. There they met King Herod of Judea, and asked where the king of the Jews had been born. Herod then asked his advisers where a messiah could be born. They replied Bethlehem, a nearby village, and quoted a prophecy by Micah. While the magi were on their way to Bethlehem, the star appeared again. As they followed the star, it stopped this time above the place where Jesus was born. The magi found Jesus with his mother, paid him homage, worshipped him and gave gifts. They then returned to their \"own country\".\nMany Christians see the star as a miraculous sign given by God to mark the birth of the Christ (or Messiah). Some theologians claimed that the star fulfilled a prophecy, known as the Star Prophecy. In modern times, astronomers have proposed various explanations for the star. A nova, a planet, a comet, an occultation and a conjunction [alignment of planets] have all been suggested. The star has also been interpreted as an astrological event.\nMany scholars question the historicity of the story and argue that the star was a fiction created by the author of the Gospel of Matthew. While its historicity is in dispute, the tradition of a star has given rise to other Christmas traditions, like topping the Christmas tree with a star. In the Philippines, the bamboo parol (\"pah-role\"), or star lantern, is the symbol of Christmas.\nInterestingly, if the wise men had followed the star Sirius whenever it was visible, they would have indeed reached Bethlehem.\n"}
{"SupportPartyMember": "In a group of people with various superpowers, this is the one teammate with no offensive powers. Teamed with An Ice Person, a Flying Brick, and someone with Heat Vision, he'll be the one with telepathy or Healing Hands. His power, if usable at all in combat, are purely defensive. Unlike What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway?, that does not necessarily make him useless, as he may be the only one capable of advancing the plot and his powers may have the most Mundane Utility. After all, beating the bad guy is good and all, but you need to know who the bad guy is, and find and reach him first. Then there are some creative ways of using their power such as Revive Kills Zombie.\nVery often The Chick or The Smart Guy is likely to have this in a Five-Man Band. See also Utility Party Member, White Mage, The Medic, and Combat Medic. In Videogames, the White Magician Girl is often this.\n"}
{"EarnedStripes": "Sometimes when a person is acknowledged for their deeds or their mastery, they are given a means to tell everyone at a glance. When you literally 'earn your stripes,' you get a physical change in appearance that indicates your rank.\nUsually this is a costume change like a new uniform. If not a whole new outfit, then a subtle change of accessory, or another customization can do the trick. Other times it may be a bodily change like ritual scars, tattoos, or a haircut. They can be bestowed in an Awesome Moment of Crowning or graduation ceremony.\nEarning them may be done by proving your valor in a real life situation, or passing a controlled set of trials and exams. Rookies look forward to the day they can wear them. We may follow a character as they go through the process, and learn the meaning behind the stripes instead of just idolizing the appearance and perks. Pride at proving themselves worthy of stripes is often its own reward.\nThe point is when you see a person wearing these stripes you know they demand respect. And wearing them without earning them properly is a social taboo, extremely disrespectful, and can even be a Berserk Button for members of the culture. Similarly earning them and refusing to wear them is a major symbolic rebuke to the ones bestowing it.\nSupertrope to Color-Coded Patrician, and Hat of Authority. Often overlaps with Prestige Class. Compare Power Makeover when the power itself causes the transformation rather than ritual. Contrast Slave Brand, where a mark is given to indicate that you're lower on the totem pole, and is often by forced on rather than granted by merit. See Insignia Rip-Off Ritual for when the stripes are no longer deserved, regardless of which side does it.\nNeedless to say, this trope overlaps heavily with Field Promotion.\n"}
{"PatchworkFic": "Want to do an Earth-3 story, but feel really strongly about the characterization of Superman with an ant's head? Look no further. Patchwork Fic is the term for Fan Fic in which the author uses particular characters from different adaptations of the same franchise.\nMost of the time, this is to combat particular instances of Character Derailment, or because the author really just has a particular dislike for a character, but feels that using a different version is more magnanimous than not at all. Sometimes it's due to not having seen a certain adaptation of the character (a comic book hero versus a television version of the hero). Other times, one odd version of the character ended up being more interesting than every other, especially an Ascended Extra. And perhaps the writer just doesn't realize that the character is different in this version.\nOccasionally, a particularly creative writer will adapt an otherwise unseen character into the universe he's using with what he thinks is the appropriate \"mood\", making it a quasi-Original Character. For example, a large amount of DC Comics fan art toys with the idea of how characters not adapted into the DCAU might look and behave if they were; the better examples of Sailor Earth fall in line with this as well.\nBut sometimes it's because someone becomes so saturated in the fandom that the adaptations blend together. It was even commonplace to mention in the Author's Notes if you were using an unexpected version of characters, just so purists wouldn't complain that you were mangling characterizations.\nIf a writer is lucky, Adaptation Decay will provide some quirks to convey one version of the character to the audience quickly. Ideally, though, this results in un-official Adaptation Distillation.\nA subtrope of Acceptable Breaks from Canon. See Ret-Canon and Canon Immigrant for when this happens in canonical works. Sometimes overlaps with Composite Character.\nNot to related to Patchwork Kids, which is when a child's personality and appearance are essentially just a mashup of their parents' own; or to Patchwork Story, which is when a number of short works in the same continuity are edited in order for them to fit together and form a single long work.\n"}
{"RolePlayingGameVerse": "A world straight out of a Role Playing Game. Some are adaptations of either computer RPGs or tabletop RPGs. Others were created independently, inspired by these games and their cultural ancestors.\nWill use some, if not most, of the Role-Playing Game Terms, but how many obviously depends on the writers.\nOften set in The Time of Myths or Medieval European Fantasy with any technology being Lost Technology or perhaps Schizo Tech. Compare RPG-Mechanics Verse, when the characters themselves are aware of game mechanics.\n"}
{"OlympusMons": "Sometimes, in Mon games, the game will allow the player to capture and control creatures that a preteen hero has absolutely no business owning. A kind of Did You Just Punch Out Cthulhu? moment for The Kid with the Remote Control, Mon games will allow the player to capture cosmic entities, living forces of nature, and other cataclysmal beings. Of course, other media occasionally have gods captured by humankind as well.\nDon't expect this power to be easy to come by, however. A lot of Olympus Mons require that you prove yourself worthy to command them by defeating them in combat first. If this is the case in a video game, this often means that the fight against them will be That One Boss, or a Bonus Boss that isn't accessible until later in the game. Basically the living equivalent of an Infinity +1 Sword.\nStrangely, these beings seem to be perfectly content with their human masters, and rarely rebel. If they do, though? Be very, very afraid.\nThe name is a pun on Olympus Mons, Latin for Mt. Olympus and also a volcano on Mars that's also the largest known mountain in the solar system. This trope is the exact opposite of Com Mons.\n"}
{"StrawmanFallacy": "The Strawman Fallacy occurs when a debater constructs a more easily defeated version of his opponent's position to attack, rather than addressing his real arguments. The fallacy takes its name from straw dummies used in old-fashioned combat training; these dummies were made to look like a potential opponent, but provide no actual resistance. The fallacy itself is comparable to defeating such a dummy, then proclaiming you have defeated an actual opponent.\nWhile most people will not be fooled by a blatant misrepresentation of their position, careful use of a strawman can make them defend a carefully undermined version of their position, allowing their opponent to apparently destroy them with a prepared rebuttal.\nFor examples see The War on Straw. Beloved of Author Tracts the world over. The Straw Misogynist and the Straw Feminist both use this technique subtly.\n"}
{"BaldofAwesome": "Baldness is usually implemented by television and film writers as a sign of premature aging, poor morality, or just general weakness. But occasionally, baldness instead indicates just how awesome a character is, usually representing leadership or over-the-top manliness. Bald, Black Leader Guy is a popular subtrope since, for some reason, black men in leadership positions are almost always bald in fiction. In the spirit of not spinning off into over-troping, this includes men and women who voluntarily shave their heads.\nIt's interesting to note that among actors, great lengths used to be taken to avoid shaving their heads for a role (or taking off their toupee for those that were already bald), as it was something they couldn't drop once the filming ending and the cameras stopped rolling. The bald wig was elevated to an art form during this period. As an example, take a look at the Bill Murray movie Stripes. For the boot camp scenes, everyone else in the cast sports shaved heads, whereas Bill Murray and Harold Ramis merely got short haircuts. Nowadays, not shaving your head for a role that requires it is seen as unprofessional and not being dedicated to your craft.\nContrast Bald of Evil. See also Perma-Shave. Depending on the context, Bald Women is the Distaff Counterpart of this trope.\nNo Real Life Examples, Please! It is sufficient to say that bald people who are badasses do exist in Real Life, so it is Truth in Television.\n"}
{"JackUpWithPhlebotinum": "Bob is someone with certain... lusts in life. It may be something as simple as loving to eat a lot, or something as self-destructive as heroin. The point is, he's jonesing, and he's jonesing bad. And suddenly, he finds a stash of what appears to be the good stuff! Jackpot!! Bob then consumes or shoots up the stuff...\n...Only to suddenly mutate into a hideous monster, melt into a pile of goo or keel over dead!!\nPoor Bob, he just had to Jack Up With Phlebotinum. Instead of the good stuff, the stuff he consumed was actually some sort of harmful substance or Applied Phlebotinum, and he has now become either a casualty of some bizarre effect or something less than human. Either way, Bob himself has now become an integral part of the plot somehow. Perhaps his demise sets events in motion that drive the plot, or perhaps he becomes some sort of monster and is now the antagonist. Bottom line is he really shouldn't have done the stuff.\nThis trope involves the poor fellow imbibing the nasty stuff by accident. If it was deliberately caused by someone else, it's Tampering with Food and Drink or Slipping a Mickey. It also differs because those usually involve more mundane substances, while this trope involves taking some VERY bad shit.\nFantastical or exaggerated subtrope of Drugs Are Bad. Compare Mushroom Samba, where the character accidentally imbibes something that blows his brain instead of his body.\n"}
{"BrokenHero": "A hero who is a dropout, result of a failed experiment (in Sci-Fi), or maybe just abandoned/abused as a child. Nonetheless, this character is amazingly cheerful and optimistic, and nice to even the people who don't appreciate them. May be introduced as a Big Eater, a ditz, or some other harmless personality. They may even make some ostensibly humorous jabs at themself.\nTheir Back Story is usually learned in flashbacks sometime later in a show, sometimes without warning. This can shock the other characters, especially The Rival Anti-Hero, and earns them respect. By definition, they are usually also Stepford Smilers or Sad Clowns.\nA Beta Test Baddie and a Broken Hero often have a complicated relationship of sympathy tied with dislike, until the former finally loses patience with the latter.\n"}
{"BadassDamsel": "Rejecting the traditional Damsel in Distress routine, this damsel doesn't wait for a hero to rescue her. She can take care of herself, thank you very much. This trope occurs when the damsel escapes on her own, or at least makes significant progress towards it before the hero can find her. Extra points if she manages to do it still bound; even more if she then helps the hero escape the danger he's putting himself into.\nAlmost Always Female, and usually a Plucky Girl.\nCompare with Play-Along Prisoner, Lady of War for a skillful and graceful fighter, Silk Hiding Steel is this trope's prim and proper relative, Xenafication for inexplicable badass leveling up, Deliberately Distressed Damsel who enjoys the damsel aspect, and Decoy Damsel who pretends to be a Damsel in Distress for her own benefit.\nContrast Damsel Scrappy and Too Dumb to Live. Should not be confused with Badass in Distress, but can overlap with it. Compare Defiant Captive, which is about a defiant mindset while captured.\n"}
{"TragicallyMisguidedFavor": "When Bob cares a lot for Alice, who has a problem in her life, and Bob decides to fix it, without asking Alice whether this is a good idea (or even despite Alice's explicit request not to interfere). After Bob's elaborate plan succeeds, however, it turns out that by doing it, he ended up ruining his relationship with Alice, or even their very lives.\nA cornerstone of Romantic Comedy but can also result in a form of Tragic Hero or even Tragic Monster. Compare Rhetorical Request Blunder, Stupid Sacrifice, Senseless Sacrifice, \"Gift of the Magi\" Plot. Related to Poisonous Friend.\nAn inherently spoiler-y trope, so be warned!\n"}
{"LivingForeverIsNoBigDeal": "Some immortal characters are disappointed by eternal life, find it boring at best, unbearable at worst, and wish, more than anything, to die. They are covered by Who Wants to Live Forever?. Then on the contrary, we have those who take advantage of their immortality, and enjoy it: Living Forever Is Awesome. And then\u2026 there are those characters.\nThey are immortal. They don't age. They're Older Than Dirt, maybe even Time Abyss. And\u2026 they never address the issue. Their life goes on and they don't question it, and if asked about what they think of their immortality, their answer would probably be just as vague as a random Mr. Smith asked \"What do you think of life in general?\".\nThe reasons for that vary: sometimes, they're just born that way, and living forever is for them the \"normal\" kind of life (they may even have an issue grasping the very idea of Death); sometimes, the writer's idea (since most writers are mortals) is that living forever would be, well, living, and continuing to live just like you live your normal life.\nTends to be the general mindset of a Society of Immortals.\n"}
{"MotherNature": "The arch-Nature Spirit of Earth... or whatever planet is the story's setting. May or may not have a humanoid form (substitute \"humanoid\" with whatever species equivalent in non-terrestrial settings), but if it is, it's Always Female due to Mother Nature, Father Science. Tends to dress in a Garden Garment and leave a trail of flowers where their Fertile Feet tread.\nOf course, if you actually look at old cultures Mother Nature tends to occur mainly in fertile places, and infertile parts of the world often had male Earth deities. Egypt had Geb, for instance, and the Norse had Ymir and Frey.\nOften a bona fide Physical God, if not outright one of the Powers That Be. Actually pissing her off is likely to result in Gaia's Vengeance, while making her sad can result in Gaia's Lament. If merely human but with a gift for gardening and horticulture, an Earth Mother.\n"}
{"OfficialCosplayGear": "The company for a work sells costumes or accessories based on their work, so that fans (usually younger kids) can dress up like their favorite characters. Obviously, this includes those annual assortments of official Halloween costumes based on the year's current movie blockbusters and whatnot, but some of these items are produced and available year-round.\nNow actual Cosplayers almost never get involved with this stuff, unless either companies offered tailoring services, perhaps, or it's to take apart and reconstruct with more expensive material and more accuracy.\nThis can also overlap with Defictionalization (if gear is made based on a Show Within a Show or in the case of working examples of said gear), Sexy Whatever Outfit.\nA Sub-Trope of The Merch.\n"}
{"DruggedLipstick": "A character (naturally, usually a woman) wears lipstick with some sort of drug or poison in it, with the result that anyone who kisses her is affected by it. Only very rarely is it explained why the wearer of the lipstick is immune. (In all likelihood, she has access to an antidote she takes beforehand.)\nCompare Kiss of Death, Post-Kiss Catatonia.\n"}
{"MagicVersusTechnology": "Magic is often seen as the realm of mysticism and a violation of scientific laws. Science is often seen as the realm of materialism and technology. These two realms are often viewed as unresolveable opposites; where magic holds sway, science must fail and where science holds sway, magic must fail. This trope builds on the potential factors that cause a divide between the \"science\" and \"magic\" in a work. However, please keep in mind the rules of Clarke's Third Law and the inverse law; there isn't really a difference between the concepts, except for their presentation in the story.\nIn many stories, modern technology (often called \"science\") is placed in opposition to the will of a person influencing the universe (often called \"magic\"). This divide can build into The Magic Versus Technology War, where both sides of the debate attempt to eliminate the other side. Stories which present the divide often use one or more reasons for the separation, summarized here:\nCompare the following tropes: Doing In the Wizard for when seemingly magical manifestations are explained as science. Doing In the Scientist for when scientific anomalies are later explained as magic. Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane for when the phenomenon is inadequately explained either way and the characters just can't tell. Fantastic Science for when the scientist begins to make magic their field of study. Post-Modern Magik for when the magic takes cues from technology.\nTo see Magic A Versus Magic B, there's Unequal Rites. If you were looking for a trope where scientists and wizards actually get into a brawl, see The Magic Versus Technology War. Science Fantasy is a genre for the heavy mixing of the two, which may or may not contain such a war. How Unscientific! is a violation of Genre Consistency that allows a work to temporarily operate as Science Fantasy.\n"}
{"VillainCorner": "When a certain (allegedly) non-villainous character starts getting explicitly dark character development, they are being painted into the Villain Corner.\nThis new development can be either subtle or blatant, gradual or abrupt. The character can be an old friend of the protagonist, a friendly acquaintance, a former Mentor, or any other type of automatically respected person; the character can even be the actual protagonist. It can involve the revelations of dark deeds from the character's past, or manifest in new actions or attitudes which go against the established grain. In any of these cases, the audience is not supposed to suspect anything evil about this person; indeed, there may not be anything evil about them, at least initially.\nThe key to this trope is ambiguity. Once a previously good character begins to undergo this treatment, the narrative typically will become increasingly mum about their actual motivations and alignment. This can serve as an unintentional (or intentional) Lampshade Hanging, as it is a sure sign that we're not dealing with the sympathetic character we started out with.\nThis tactic CAN be handled well, and can add nuance and intrigue to an established character, shaking up potential story arcs and fan expectations. But when executed poorly, a clever audience will have them picked out from the beginning like an oak tree in a beanfield, even if the other characters don't see it.\nCompare Knight Templar and Well-Intentioned Extremist, which is where this trope often ends up. See also Anti-Villain.\n"}
{"YellowEyesOfSneakiness": "In fiction, when a character has yellow eyes, commonly the sclera, but can be the iris, it usually denotes that a character has a rather unscrupulous nature. Sure signs that a character cannot be trusted or is a bit of a Jerkass.\nHistorically, this is probably inspired by canines, felines, rodents, reptiles, and birds of prey, which can have amber, yellow, gold, or orange irises, and are associated with being conniving, clever, and wise. Also reptiles and toads are sometimes associated with villainy, and can have yellow eyes. Ironically in these animals what you're usually seeing are larger irises which were probably mistaken for a yellow sclera. In particular, the visual itself might be related to the reflective eyes of many animals in the dark, which explains the particular bright palette in contrast with dark or dim figures.\nA variant of this trope is a sneaky or crafty character with yellow or light-yellow eyes that have green or yellow green centers to them. Sometimes, the green-centered yellow eyes are used to accentuate the character\u2019s sneakyness, craftiness, meanness, and/or evil in relation to non-green-centered yellow eyes or to distinguish them as the crafty or evil ones within works made up of largely or mostly yellow eyed characters. Non-green-centered yellow, gold, or amber eyes are more apt to be portrayed as normal or least less decidedly crafty or evil and are more apt to show up on good and ostensibly good characters.\nIn Real Life, yellow and brown in the sclerae or the cornea, not the iris, in human beings is unhealthy.

{"NemesisWeapon": "It's common for The Hero to have an Arch-Enemy; moreover, if the hero has a suitably powerful weapon or Iconic Item, it may be that said weapon or tool will also have an antithesis, which is similar in appearance and powers but is used to opposite ends.\nThe hero's iconic weapon and its nemesis tend to share a common origin. Probably they were both Forged by the Gods or at least by the Ultimate Blacksmith. In this case, they are much like Evil Twins. Alternatively, the nemesis may have been made as an Evil Knockoff of the original, and specifically designed to defeat it. Creating a good weapon to defeat an evil one is more rare. Depending on their relationship, the nemesis weapon may have powers that are the same as those used by the hero, or they may be the exact opposite; indeed, if the hero's is an Empathic Weapon, the other will probably be an Evil Weapon.\nThe nemesis weapon is likely to be used by the Big Bad, but might also go to The Rival, The Dragon or another lesser enemy. It can also change hands as these are defeated, being acquired by more powerful foes. Similarly, the 'good' weapon may be wielded by The Lancer or some other secondary heroic character.\nThe weapon may signify its wielder as an Evil Counterpart to the hero, or otherwise hint that they are Foils in some regard. It also serves to amplify the hero's challenge, by negating the advantage their weapon gives and forcing them to rely on their inherent skills, virtues, or greater number of allies to win. Because of this, the nemesis weapon is more likely to appear near the end of the story.\nSee also Counterpart Artifacts, Evil Counterpart and Reforged into a Minion, two similar tropes that occur to characters.\n"}
{"TheUnwittingComedian": "The world is a terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible place. I mean, it is just awful. Wall-street is bleeding us all for all we have, my wife left me for her Brazilian boss, my kids are shut-in, coked-eup and in prison, and don't get me started on my knees and the crunching noises they make. They're really...\n...what? What are you laughing at? This isn't funny! STOP IT! STOP LAUGHING AT ME!!!\nThe Unwitting Comedian is the funniest person around. It's a shame that they don't think so. Maybe it is something they say or something they do. Whatever the case, the people around them seem to think it's funny. In more extreme cases, the things they say or do would not appear funny to the audience, but the people in-universe would not be able to help themselves as they Die Laughing.\nAs for the comedian, this is usually makes them the Sad Clown of their stories, their inability to be taken seriously making their lives harder than it needs to be. Sometimes they would take advantage of this and go into stand-up, becoming incredibly popular. Depending on how it is handled, the story featuring such a character tends to shift around the Sliding Scale of Silliness vs. Seriousness.\n"}
{"SupportingHarem": "A Subtrope of the Harem Genre, a Romantic Comedy with one male protagonist, one female Love Interest, and a bunch of female side characters who also happen to be in love with the protagonist (or at least like him very much).\nIn these stories, the bigger emphasis is usually on the \"romantic\" part of Romantic Comedy, with the relationship building between the main Official Couple, and the side characters are only there for the viewer to like them, and maybe as a Romantic False Lead, to keep some drama between the main characters.\nCertain character types like the Hot Teacher or the Ojou are likely to be members of this, as a straight romantic story with them at the center often wouldn't work at all, or at least it would invite too many unusual plot points for a standart series. Not that it hasn't been done.\nA romantic story with Tsundere is usually very likely to get into this trope, as the authors like to use some of the support girls for Romantic Runner-Up in the love story between the protagonist and the extremely jealous Patient Childhood Love Interest or Little Sister Heroine.\nOne of the causes for this set-up might be if it is the adaptation of a Romance Game, where every girl got the focus of attention in her own route, but only one route got an adaptation.\nContrast with Balanced Harem, where several girls have equal prominence during the story. See also Top Wife, a further evolution of this trope, where there's clearly one girl at the top but the protagonist still gets to Marry Them All.\n"}
{"TheGoodOldBritishComp": "Comprehensive schools, now generally just called \"Secondary Schools\", were set up in the 1960s by the Harold Wilson government, replacing the old system of Grammars and Secondary Moderns (where you went and a lot of your future depended on the dreaded 11 plus exams \u2014 this system still prevails in Northern Ireland and small parts of England, and a variation on it can be seen in the Harry Potter books and movies).\nSchool buildings in the UK widely vary in age, from Victorian era to brand new. On TV, many are Victorian. Fortunately, the days of the outside toilets and outside swimming pools are gone. Actually, the \"outside\" has gone too, having been sold off to property developers.\nBritish school pupils in almost all cases are required to wear school uniforms, and you can spot a troublemaker from a mile off by the fact that he or she isn't wearing it properly (skirt too short, tie askew, shirt not tucked in, top button undone). It is of note that in some schools, not wearing one's uniform correctly has encroached en masse, to the extent that very few pupils wear the entire uniform correctly. They generally include a white shirt, tie, dark bottoms (trousers or skirts), smart dark shoes and, quite often, a blazer.\nThese troublemakers also like to smoke behind the bike sheds, where romance also takes place. (Presumably, the smoke obscures the romance.) These days smoking in the Staff Room is illegal, so pupils and teachers both disappear behind the bike sheds where they carefully ignore each other.\nKids in glasses are generally portrayed as \"swots\", as are \"prim and proper young ladies\" (e.g., Hermione Granger from Harry Potter). The former get bullied, the latter may turn out to be Beautiful All Along.\nGangs are common, both of the good (\"let's have a jape\") and bad (\"let's nick the smart kid's dinner money\") variety, although most schools now have electronic payment for school dinners, so it's more \"steal their dinner card/finger print\". Kids in TV schools display a far greater degree of coordination on their own than one ever saw in real life. The teachers have to be called \"Miss\" or \"Sir\" (a policy that only actually happens in some schools) and are generally highly strict. Whatever you do, don't annoy the Head Teacher.\nThey used to be able to administer a caning, but this was stopped in the 1980s; many a media commentator has called for its return. Highly popular for the expected hijinks the students (and also often teachers) will get up to, because really, they shouldn't get up to them. Such shows are naturally prone to Dawson Casting.\nThere are a wide range of differences between English and Scottish schools, but none of them are relevant to the trope, except that uniforms seem to be more optional.\nSee also British Education System. Compare and contrast with Boarding School, the other British education trope.\n"}
{"FoodGod": "This is the god of whatever food is the basis for a culture's survival \u2014 usually grain, but for a steppe people it might be grass for animals and for a coastal people it might be fish, or whatever is appropriate to a given environment.

{"ColdSnap": "An episode in a series where snow and cold are the order of the day, as opposed to the normal setting.\nIn many series almost all of the action takes place in mild, clear weather. This allows the cast to dress comfortably, and saves money on weather effects. But some stories need extremely cold weather and/or snow to work. Thus the Cold Snap episode.\nThis may be an episode that acknowledges that the setting normally has winter, even if all the scenes are shot inside. Or perhaps there's a freak snowstorm in a setting that normally doesn't have cold weather, making it a Big Storm Episode. In some cases, the cast travels to a cold area specifically to enjoy winter activities, a cold counterpart to the Beach Episode.\nA Christmas Episode may also be this, but usually that trope has the pleasant form of Dreaming of a White Christmas.\nCompare Rain, Rain, Go Away, Heat Wave (both dealing with different weather extremes).\n"}

See also Amusing Injuries.\nNot to be confused with attacking with tails.\n"}
{"InventoryManagementPuzzle": "How many things can you carry on your person? If your life depended on it, do you think you could manage just one more?\nThere are lots and lots of practical reasons that a game might want to place some bounds on your carrying capacity. For one thing, like everything else, there's only a finite amount of memory to track inventory, and only a finite amount of screen space to show it, in accordance with the game's particular idiom. Also, there's the matter of the Combinatorial Explosion. Limit what the player can carry, so that he isn't hauling around objects that will make the designer's life hard in the future.\nAnd then, there are the games which limit your inventory because the game designers want to make inventory management a part of the game, to force players to manage another resource. At the simplest level, this is managed by simply limiting the number of items. So, you can carry around only a handful of items. A common abstraction is to define inventory in terms of weight, with (nearly) arbitrary weights assigned to each item. To make matters worse, if a notion of item size exists at all, it's sometimes very coarsely defined: either you can carry eight items, whether the items are paper clips or pianos, or you can carry eight \"units\" of equipment, but one unit is \"anything smaller than a breadbox,\" and two units is \"A BFG.\"\nThere are many reasons the game designer may have for imposing this inventory limit, such as:\nTo make matters worse one of the things that keeps our limited carrying capacity in real life from being too onerous a burden is the fact that we can set things down. Far too often, a game will impose an inventory limit, but not implement any sophisticated notion of chucking stuff on a shelf or table, sticking it in a cupboard, or otherwise leaving it wherever you happen to be at the moment. Far more popular is to limit the player to only storing items at certain special locations, usually subject to their own inventory limits. Or only giving the player the option to discard items outright, removing them from play altogether. If the designer decided to allow the player to drop things wherever he likes, dropped items may yet be subject to Everything Fades. The ability to transport more items in a vehicle is also often left out.\nAt least within the hobbyist community, game authors who impose an inventory limit to genres which usually do not feature them will often feel the need to justify this, claiming to have \"always been bothered\" by the blatant unrealism of unbounded carrying. Strangely, players who do not go on to write games which feature an unreasonable inventory limit never seem to have trouble with this.\nOne positive effect of imposing inventory limits on a player is to limit hoarding. In general, when players find things, they keep them, unless they have an immediate need for money, in which case they sell them. Players only use items that are in limited supply when absolutely needed (and in the case of stuff Too Awesome to Use, not even then). A limited inventory is a way to suggest to a player that they should be using more stuff. That is, shooting more, using more health potions, etc. And even if the player can't acquire any more consumable items, it isn't a problem (with a sufficiently large inventory) because that means the player is well-stocked for the next portion of the game. Typically, the problem with inventory happens when you have to drop key items or drop a box of 10 shotgun shells knowing full well that you're going to need them in the next 5 minutes.\nRemember, Tropes Are Not Bad.\nThe Inventory Management Puzzle is actually well known in applied mathematics and computer science circles where it goes by the name of The Knapsack Problem. The Knapsack Problem is defined as given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the count of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most useful items. Unfortunately what makes the Knapsack Problem well known is that it's an exemplar of a class of problems that are inefficient to solve in the general case. This means that the best method to solve the problem is to try every possible combination and see which one works best.\nSee also Grid Inventory and Limited Loadout.\n"}
{"LiterallyFallingInLove": "When Alice and Bob both Cannot Spit It Out or have had an Unresolved Sexual Tension for a long time, occasionally fate helps a little by making one of them trip for some reason (often a fight) and fall on the other. They may both lose their footing and fall to the ground, or the standing one might brace the impact against a wall. Either way, awk-ward.\nIn some cases, they will separate and apologize, or Alice will scream and slap Bob, calling him a pervert. But if this trope is in action, neither will happen. By the magic (and surprise) of their sudden proximity, they will fall silent. They'll look intensely into each other's eyes, forgetting their fight entirely. Everything around them will fade, and their lips will slowly get closer, before locking into a True Love's Kiss. If there is no immediate kiss, it will at least be a Near Kiss, and probably an Aww, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other moment.\nCompare Crash-Into Hello, which has little chance to result in a kiss for obvious reasons.\nA Sister Trope to the less romantic and more comic Suggestive Collision, which can result in Marshmallow Hell or Thanks for the Mammary but is much less likely to end well.

{"DependingOnTheAuthor": "In some stories, a character is very different every time they appear \u2014 so different that it's almost a different character with the same name. This is particularly common with long-running shows and comic books and even This Very Wiki, due to the large number of writers on staff. But there are some characters where even the same writer makes them different every time.\nThis is not the same as Character Development \u2014 nothing happens in the story to justify the personality change. Writer on Board or Creator Breakdown might, though.\nDon't get this confused with character depth. Just because you can't predict a character's moves 100% of the time doesn't mean they're inconsistent. Now, if you can predict a character's moves 100% of the time only when you know who's writing, then they're definitely inconsistent.\nDifferent writers with different ideas and understandings of the work are also the usual culprit of Continuity Drift.\nIf the writers themselves begin to notice this, they might attempt an Author's Saving Throw. If they can find a way to plausibly reconcile the two depictions, it may even lead to genuine Character Development, acknowledging that real people are complex and full of apparent contradictions.\nSee also Ping-Pong Na\u00efvet\u00e9.\nCompare Alternative Character Interpretation, Depending on the Artist, Era-Specific Personality, Same Character, but Different, Interpretative Character, Armed with Canon, Running the Asylum, Character Derailment.\n"}
{"BattleInTheCentreOfTheMind": "One of the basic building blocks of storytelling is a character's inner struggle, their efforts to balance their base urges and lofty ideals. This is not conducive to high octane explosions and fist fights, nor is it easily transmitted in television even by serious series. However, toss in demons, Mind Control, and a Journey to the Center of the Mind, and you'll get a Battle in the Center of the Mind.\nWhat ends up happening is you get the mental equivalent of a no-holds-barred psychic showdown between the evil force trying to take over and the owner or his/her allies. The evil force can be of various natures, including: Demons, Ghosts, an evil computer virus, other humans via Mind Control or the self with an Enemy Within or Super-Powered Evil Side. What the possessing force wants is either a full Split-Personality Takeover, or (if external) to maintain control.\nOpposing this force is usually the \"host\" or person that is being affected. Occasionally, their mind is too weak and addled to oppose the invader, so a friendly telepath or mystic will insert an ally or two to try and rout the bad guy. They will fail. However, the act of them trying and yelling \"I know you are in there somewhere!\" and going in to save them from the evil presence in their mind is usually enough to get the host to kick their unwanted guest out of their mind if not completely obliterate it when it threatens their friends. The thing is, no matter how powerful the invader, it can't beat a determined victim's home brain advantage.\nThe fight itself will usually use highly symbolic weapons (a chef's ladle now doubles as a BFS), defenses (a security blanket can now block Ki Attacks) and even imaginary allies (summoning up an army of Supermen to help you out), turning into something similar to a Shape Shifter Showdown.\nFor those on the outside, it's usually obvious that the character is Fighting from the Inside.\n"}

{"LevelGrinding": "The term \"grinding\" refers to having to repeat the same action or group of actions over and over in order to gain money or the equivalent, power-ups or extra health. One can take that \"up to eleven\" by grinding for the purpose in order to raise one's experience points or one's character level.\nIn RPGs, one usually gains strength and abilities through repeatedly killing monsters, over and over again.\nForget trying to figure out the right combination of elemental attacks; just walk around a certain area and kill smaller monsters for a week, then pound away at the 'boss monster' as if you were the Incredible Hulk.\nIn video game plots, only The Hero ever has this advantage against monsters. It never occurs to townspeople to walk around their own village and smash slimes until they're strong enough to face the pirate who's taken over.\nIn online RPGs (and regular ones occasionally), this is known as \"powerleveling\" or simply \"grinding\" and is somewhat controversial, as it can be a tedious, mechanical affair criticized for taking the fun out of a game. It is considered extremely rude to level grind and then complain a boss is painfully easy.\nThe traditional way of level grinding is to kill lots of a very low level enemy, for example, rats. However, Metal Slime-type enemies that give out large amounts of experience can shorten the process considerably. Given that the second group are always much more likely to be able to actually kill your character at lower levels, a ladder system is usually employed. Modern MMORPGs have turned to 'Quest Grinding' instead, offering both one-time and Repeatable Quests with massive Experience Point rewards compared to simply killing hordes of monsters - but this has simply changed the type of activity players use to grind instead of eliminating the grind altogether.\nIn such games any Experience Booster is worth its weight in gold.note\u00a0But don't forget the Money Multiplier to get all that gold more quickly.\nThe act of Level Grinding is probably one contributing factor to the creation of the Bonus Dungeon.\nLevel Scaling can invert the trope, with monsters that scale according to the character's level. This negates the need to grind, but introduces its own set of problems.\nIf the game is unbalanced or mean enough to practically require you to level grind, that's Forced Level-Grinding, not to mention Fake Longevity. On the other hand, there's Anti-Grinding, where the developers set up something that stops this behavior, as well as Low-Level Advantage. Other times, if the developers give the player a convenient spot to do this with, it's Peninsula of Power Leveling.\nSister trope of Item Farming and Money Grinding.\n"}

Maybe Superman will show up for an issue or two, but only because, well, he's Superman.

{"GlamRock": "Glam rock is a subgenre of Rock & Roll that developed mainly in Britain during The '70s. As far as the music itself went, glam bands was the mainstream alternative to the nascent Progressive Rock and Heavy Metal genres, with songs that evoked the kind of good old fashioned rock 'n' roll of The '50s and The '60s, which won a lot of glam bands the same kind of huge teenage audiences that had screamed at the The Beatles and The Rolling Stones in the last decade.\nWhat really identifies glam rock and set it apart was its focus on image. This was the age of outlandish costumes and theatrical on-stage antics, often highly sexualised. Just as the music often seemed like it was trying to evoke rock's rebellious attitude, the fashion and energetic performances aimed to dress it up in over-the-top grandeur.\nAs mentioned above, glam rock was primarily popular in the UK, where the genre was split into three subgenres. For the artistically-inclined listener there was the artsy stylings of David Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust persona, the over the top operatic art rock of Queen, and the synth-trickery of Roxy Music. Beloved by teenagers were the straight-up rock and roll acts such as T. Rex, Gary Glitter, Mott the Hoople and Showaddywaddy. Finally, there were harder rocking groups like Slade and Sweet, whose fusion of pop-melodies with loud guitars and drums would be a significant influence on Hair Metal ten years later.\nAlthough its heyday has long since passed, glam rock has been highly influential in the development of popular music. Hair Metal is an obvious result, but you'd also be hard pressed to find a British Punk Rock, Post-Punk, New Romantic, New Wave Music or Goth Rock band not influnced by Bowie or Bryan Ferry, while the simple style and image conscious approach have been a major influnce on Britpop and a lot of contemporary indie rock.\nOften associated with Hair Metal.\n"}
{"AcceptableEthnicTargets": "A subset of Acceptable Targets. Remember that these aren't always ethnic in the literal sense we're used to \u2014 they just refer to groups who are targeted for their physical appearance or for having inborn traits that they can't really change. Foreign/unusual accents and dialects are also typically considered speech impediments, and therefore become subjects of mockery much like Acceptable Hard Luck Targets.\nWhite Anglo-Saxon Protestant males\nAdvertising\nLive-Action TV\nIrish-Americans\nCast as being in the seat of white privilege (which means, of course, that they're Catholic Celts who are considered WASPs), and still obsessed with their heritage and worse days that may or may not have existed.

They are usually portrayed as being incredibly poor and will usually be sorted in the same class stereotypes as some African-American groups resulting in many conflicts (ex. gangs). This is often portrayed in dramas dealing with high schools in urban high crime areas such as Dangerous Minds. They're about the second most discussed ethnicity when it comes to things like educational achievement and economic mobility, right after black people but before Asians.\nLive-Action TV\nWestern Animation\nAmerican Indians\nGenerally portrayed as either Always Male sex objects, wise mystics in tune with the earth, or greedy casino owners. They also like to assert themselves as the true Americans and call other Americans intruders.\nItalian Americans\nOld stereotypes would have them as either mobsters or the wives/daughters of mobsters. These stereotypes still crop up from time to time, but they've mostly faded out... only to be replaced by the stereotype of the \"guido\" in the last few years. Thanks to MTV's Jersey Shore, having an Italian surname is an easy way for people to view you as a drunken, hard-partying, orange-skinned douchebag. If you're male, it's assumed that you use steroids, and if you're female, it's assumed that you're a slut. But hey, at least they make some great food.\nReal Life\nThey're backward, colorfully dressed nomads with funny accents. They're mysterious, if they aren't outright tricksters and thieves.

Often portrayed as outwardly cold or immoral for their part in the former Soviet Union.\nIt's still relatively common to see portrayals of non-Russian Slavs, particularly the Balkan Slavs (and people who aren't Slavs but get lumped with them anyway, such as the Romanians or Greeks) as uncultured thugs and savages keen on getting revenge on their \"ancient enemies\" i.e. their neighboring country/tribe/village. There's also depictions of them as cunning tricksters who might outwardly accept (Western) civilization, but actually just exploit it for their own gains (e.g. a mock democracy run by a clique of corrupt generals).\nInterestingly enough, despite the fact that most Slavic countries are significantly poorer than their West European neighbors and their history of being sold as slavesnote\u00a0\"Slav\" was actually the origin of the word \"slave\". or discriminated against in some of the most egregious ways known to mankind, having them portrayed in an unfavorable (or rather \"traditional\") light very rarely results in backlash similar in any way to that whenever the offended party is of not-White and/or not-Christian origins. It should come as no surprise then that whenever a Western artist is in need of a villainous character with at least somewhat exotic background but isn't willing to risk being called out on racism or another prejudice, casting a Slav in the role is pretty much their safest bet.\nSee Ruritania for more details.\nReal Life\n Video Games\nThe French\nPortrayed as snooty, arrogant, drinking too much wine, and having bad hygiene.

Expect anyone from Scotland to use weird insults, insist on wearing kilts, play bagpipes, and to be very aggressive.

Nowadays, the Arabian peninsula (and a lot of the land around it which is lumped in with it because it is A: Muslim (never mind what branch), and B: looks a bit sandy) seems to be a rich source of terrorists and people burning American flags. Ironically, before the 9/11 attacks, Arabs were still acceptable targets in a lot of Western media, being stereotyped as obnoxious nouveau riche oil sheikhs with appalling design taste - for instance, this quote from Jeremy Clarkson's Motorworld: \"The Arab is a bit flash - he'll buy a Sierra Cosworth and replace the headlamps with chandeliers. He has absolutely no taste whatsoever.\" Even before that, they were stereotyped as thieves, plunderers, and rogues, and the phrase \"You cheating Arab!\" (now confined to period pieces and racist grandparents) was a British idiom for someone having an unreasonable run of good luck at a game of chance. The association of Muslims with terrorists started in the 1970s, and other bad news coming out of the Middle East (Khomeini, Saddam Hussein, the fatwa against Salman Rushdie,...) only made these ideas more widespread. Combine this with the rise of Muslim immigrants in Western countries around the same time and its becomes more clear why both the jokes themselves and the caution to make them have risen.\nJack Shaheen, who devoted his career to analyzing and criticizing the vilifying of Arabs in popular culture, wrote in The TV Arab (1984): \"Television tends to perpetuate four basic myths about Arabs: they are all fabulously wealthy; they are barbaric and uncultured; they are sex maniacs with a penchant for white slavery; and they revel in acts of terrorism.\" In his works like Reel Bad Arabs (2006), Shaheen protested that Arabs are the last ethnic group that is socially acceptable to be cast as villains.\nComic Books\nProfessional Wrestling\nReal Life\nWeb Original\nWestern Animation\nIranians/Persians\nOften portrayed similarly to and confused with Arabs.\nLive-Action TV\nReal Life\nRecorded and Stand-Up Comedy\nWestern Animation\nFilipinos\nTend to be mocked because of \"not really being Asian\" due to the fact that Filipino culture has far more Western influences (due to three centuries of Spanish control and a few highly-influential decades of American rule and influence) than Eastern Asian ones. This thought was essentially summarized in the line of a MA Dtv sketch: \"He's not Asian, he's Filipino!\" or in an episode of Will & Grace, when Karen mentioned her boss was away on business in the Philippines: \"I like Filipinos; they're Asian, but they're not cocky about it.\" Then there are all the jokes about Filipino foreign workers caricatured as being practically everywhere. Not to mention all the mail-order brides and prostitutes jokes that always seem to pop up. Plus the fact that young Filipino boys are now seen as a kind of catch-all for what gay men are supposed to be into.\nOnly in pre-Civil Rights America. Or when done by other black people for the sake of comedy. Racism against blacks in the media is generally considered unacceptable in contemporary America, and receives more attention than racism against any other group for various reasons. For most of America's history, blacks were considered an acceptable ethnic target (see Minstrel Shows, Once Acceptable Targets). Most European and South American nations are the same. In much of Asia, depressingly, black people are still acceptable ethnic targets, though there are notable and noble exceptions.\nBoers/Afrikaners\nDuring the 1980s era when international revulsion against Apartheid was at its height, there was a brief tendency in British and American works to have white South Africans, especially Afrikaners, turning up as villains, even in stories with nothing particularly to do with South Africa. If they weren't the Big Bad, they were usually Psychos For Hire, and visually portrayed in a manner bordering on that of the Evil Albino (which isn't even accurate, since many Boers have fairly swarthy complexions from having lived for centuries in a semitropical climate). Even if the story wasn't about apartheid, they had a strong tendency to be particularly nasty to any non-white character who crossed their path.\nComic Books\n Literature\nLive-Action TV\nJamaicans\nEven though the Jamaican stereotype of a dread-locked pot-smoking Rastafarian on the beach, mon, is usually Played for Laughs, it does get extremely annoying. It is quite common for someone from Jamaica to go abroad and be asked if they live on the beach, have air-conditioning, or if they use knives and forks. Really. Also these stereotypes even spread to other Caribbean countries, due to Americans (and many others) not knowing much about countries other than Jamaica and maybe the Bahamas.\nWestern Animation\nOne's Own Race and/or Culture\nMake fun of those who look different, and you'll be labeled a racist. But if it's your own race, then it is perfectly acceptable. Note that here, the one taking the shots is not required to limit themselves to their own group in all circumstances. And, of course, if the mocker is of mixed races, that's more races to mock.\nVirtually all forms of ethnic targets for the sake of comedy are considered acceptable when the person making the statement belongs to the targeted ethnic group (see: George Lopez, Chris Rock, etc.). The same sort of 'intra-ethnic' targeting is almost uniformly considered less acceptable outside of comedy (example: Herman Cain). See Boomerang Bigot for more details.\nNote that this type of self-deprecative humor can apply to more than just ethnicity, as people usually have a \"free pass\" to poke fun at their own profession/religion/politics/place of residence, and those in the same group who are no \"Stop Having Fun\" Guys will often laugh alongside them.\nLive-Action TV\nVideo Games\nWeb Original\nWestern Animation\nReal Life\nAustralians and New Zealanders\nNew Zealanders and Australians treat each other as acceptable targets, as mentioned on that page. Both have more in common with each other than either are prepared to admit - even if Australia is thought of as a wannabe USA but without the dignity and refinement, and New Zealand's national sport is thought to be emigration to Australia. In each other's popular media, Australians are slightly dim, and New Zealanders aren't to be found beyond bludging off the taxpayer while sunning themselves on the Gold Coast.\nCanadians\nThe quirky counterpart of their neighbors to the south. They have these harmless but odd habits that are easy to make fun of, like ending their sentences with \"eh?\" and obsessing over hockey, and they're so nice and polite that if you do mock them, they'll probably take it in stride (unless you say their beer sucks). We have a whole trope on this one.\nIn the Americas, most countries mock the European potencies who colonized them, and the colonists ensure there the joke goes both two ways. Stereotyping is a cheap source of laughs, particularly emphasizing the other's Cultural Posturing. Examples include UK and US (less so with Canada), Portugal and Brazil, and Spain with basically all the other Latin Americans.\nFor many, skinny means weak and easy to defeat in a physical fight. Doubly so if said guy is also short. While being tall and lanky may be tolerated, being skinny and of average height is unacceptable for a man in the media, since such men look \"weak\" and weakness, especially physical weakness, is just the very definition of failure at being a \"real\" man.\nAdvertising\nLive-Action TV\nOverweight Women\nSuch women are pretty much the Distaff Counterpart to the above. While fat men are not exempt from being bashed, in the media - and sometimes in Real Life - it's fat women who get the brunt of said bashing, often called 'whales' or 'hippo-ladies' and considered the epitome of ugliness, which is an inexcusable and unacceptable flaw for a woman, In a World... where Men Act, Women Are. Not to mention that positive portrayals in the media are almost non-existent.\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nWestern Animation\nAlso, short people in general. Mostly for the visual. This occurs with the very tall sometimes (see below), but nearly every appearance of a dwarf on television is because their height is going to be emphasized. May be The Napoleon. It also may help to note that \"midget\" is considered a highly offensive term, yet in media it continues to be the catchall expression for dwarfs.\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nProfessional Wrestling\nReal Life\nWestern Animation\nWhile not nearly as common as mockery of short people, there's still a certain amount of mockery directed towards anyone over a certain number of feet. While often Positive Discrimination, mostly expect to see stuff like hitting their heads on light fixtures, driving a too-tiny car, and their head being cut off in photos of groups of friends/family. Also \"fun\" nicknames such as Stretch and plays on \"The _____ Giant\". For some reason seems to often have a funny-sounding voice, so may mix this with the \"Speech Impediment\" acceptable target. The tall and the generally big are also often depicted as being dumb, though there's no correlation between size and brains at all. A generally well-intentioned but particularly annoying stereotype is that height also lends an automatic athletic ability and predisposition, especially regarding basketball. This is also much more likely to affect female characters.\nLive-Action TV\nReal Life\nWestern Animation\nWeb Original\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nWestern Animation\nNatural red hair is so rare and so noticeable that it has sparked scorn and superstitions throughout history. Villains, bullies and bad-tempered jerks tend to have red hair, as do losers who get picked on. Still, redheads are just as likely to be portrayed in a positive light.\nThe hairy\nDense body hair, which is naturally quite common in men, is treated (sometimes) as something extremely repulsive and unhygienic that only gross individuals have. That is when it appears at all \u2014 generally men's chests shown on television are utterly hairless. A hairy-backed man suffers this more than most; for some women it's any sort of body hair at all. Then again, most people react to this in real life and often wonder why such people don't wax or go the whole hog.\nAdvertising\nAnime and Manga\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nProfessional Wrestling\nReal Life\nBald people\nCorrupt Corporate Executives like Lex Luthor, Straw Losers like George Costanza, and let's not even start about Nazi skinheads. For some reason, bald black men typically aren't made fun of, even if they're not a Bald, Black Leader Guy. Perhaps this is because blacks are seen as much more likely to shave their heads as an intentional hairstyle (rather than male pattern baldness) than people of other races are, and are generally agreed to look better bald, perhaps due to the prejudice against African hair noted below. Cancer patients or anyone who has lost their hair due to an illness or its treatments are also exempt from being ridiculed (though the loss of their hair will still be portrayed as traumatic and shameful). This trope only seems to apply if a) you're not black, b) you've actually lost the ability to grow hair (especially if your balding and haven't shaved the rest off) and/or c) you're evil. See also Bald of Evil. Typically averted by Bald of Awesome.\nAdvertising\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nProfessional Wrestling\nReal Life\nWeb Original\nWestern Animation\nCurly-Haired People\nThis one probably has its roots in racism. Afro-textured hair has the most stigma attached to and it's often referred to as \"nappy\" hair.

Averted with '80s Hair, Regal Ringlets, and Ojou Ringlets.\nLive-Action TV\nReal Life\nLive-Action TV\nWeb Animation\nWestern Animation\nReal Life\nMale characters are often portrayed as useless, incompetent, expendable, evil, or made to suffer.

Women who have too much sex (or even \u2018\u2019accused\u2019\u2019 of doing so), who can\u2019t control their emotions, or don\u2019t care for womanly things like wanting a man, having babies or not knowing how to raise kids are portrayed as misguided at best.\nLiterature\nLive-Action Film\nLive-Action TV\nVideogames\nHumans, when compared to other intelligent races\nEvery Intellectual Animal and Sufficiently Advanced Alien knows that Humans Are the Real Monsters.\nLive-Action TV\nVideo Games\nProducts of incest\nYes, inbreeding does increase the odds of recessive alleles doubling up in the offspring.

{"FMinusMinus": "The Book Dumb Bob just turned in his essay. It wasn't just regular bad; it was the Plan 9 from Outer Space of high school essays. It was so bad that it somehow broke literature. Obviously, the regular grading scale is not extreme enough for Bob's horrifying essay, so Bob's teacher pegs his work with a grade completely off the scale: an F--.\nIn the United States and some of Western Europe, an F is the lowest grade possible. There are no additions to it, not a plus or minus. F simply means failure, no matter how bad. However, this is not always the case in the world of fiction. Sometimes, the only way to really show how badly the student performed is to add something special to the F and let the rest take care of itself. This also means that the trope name indicates a performance so bad, that not even the nonexistent grade of F- is bad enough for it.\nThis trope is for negative grades that go off the scale, from a simple F- all the way down to Z-. Or if grades are percentage-based, the percentage will be negative, meaning that the character got more answers wrong than actually existed. A staple of school comedies that don't take themselves particularly seriously. An inversion of Rank Inflation. Contrast The B Grade. When it's a reviewer doing this, it's Broke the Rating Scale.\n"}
{"DreadfulDragonfly": "Sometimes, authors become bored of the overwhelmingly common Giant Spiders and Creepy Centipedes and try to get a little more creative with their Big Creepy-Crawlies.\nDragonflies can fill the role to perfection. After all, they combine high-speed flight, toothed mandibles and gigantic, compound eyes, and this places them among the most formidable predators among the insects, being able to prey upon even small fishes. They are also quite big for insects and their younger life stages as just as deadly: dragonfly larvae are aquatic predators with extensible mandibles that burst out to capture prey, and habitually prey on tadpoles and other small vertebrates. As such, giant dragonflies would be an incredibly terrifying sight for hapless humans, who would have no hope of outrunning them and surviving their teeth.\nSubtrope of Big Creepy-Crawlies, and subsequently of Dire Beast.\n"}
{"FirstChurchOfMecha": "Humongous Mecha are awesome, in a very literal sense. They typically have more armor than a battleship, possess enough firepower to lay waste to cities, and tower over the battlefield like gods of war. When this awe leads to worship, you end up with the First Church of Mecha, in which these war machines are hailed as gods, or even praised as a deity in a full-blown religion. In some settings, these giant fighting robots may actually be gods.\nMay involve a Cargo Cult or God Guise.\nThis trope often overlaps with Merchandise-Driven, specifically when an author who wants to write fantasy lore ends up with a sponsor who wants to sell toy robots.\nCompare Machine Worship, Deus Est Machina, Thank the Maker, Robot Religion (where the worshipers are mechanical).\n"}
{"FactionCalculus": "In Strategy Games \u2014 whether turn-based, real-time, or 4X \u2014 or tabletop wargames, when there are different factions, these will (usually) have different advantages, disadvantages, and play styles to entertain the player. With a low amount of factions, there are clear, fundamental differences, but as the factions grow, the differences subside, until eventually the sides are not polar opposites as much as points on a gradient line between two extremes.\nCompare Player Character Calculus.\nAt six or more factions, there are no established rules. At least one of the five archetypes will present two variations.\nThe contrast between the different playstyles allows for a more varied game than strictly Cosmetically Different Sides and mirror matches. However, simply making one faction slightly stronger but slower than the next rarely adds enough asymetry once enough factions are involved, so developers often turn to giving each faction a gimmick of some sort, such as long range or large numbers as is shown in A Commander Is You.\n"}
{"IJustLikeSayingTheWord": "Similar to Always Wanted to Say That and often related to Inherently Funny Words, this is when someone admits the only reason they said, or keep saying, a certain word or phrase is that it's fun to say.

{"IntellectuallySupportedTyranny": "The regime has established a tyranny that oppresses people, or carries out or initiates policies which are tyrannical, or otherwise express a lot of nasty views of Fantastic Racism and so on. Most of the people who support this have to be pure evil, right? Sure some of them are, but it's possible that some or most of them are Just Following Orders, or are being bribed by Better Living Through Evil, are intimidated into submission by fear and reprisal. But surely, no smart person could rationally condone and support such actions. Cue the ultimate Broken Pedestal, the individuals who are smart, who are competent, and even achievers in their profession, supporting an organization, state, or a set of policies that are directly harmful to others. Such individuals both believe and support such policies and even articulate elaborately written justifications that on the face of it, may sound convincing and you might even approve, reluctantly or honestly, that Jerkass Has a Point or Villain Has a Point.\nThis trope has historically been very much Truth in Television, despite the general assumption that intellectuals are supposed to be responsible in their social and political opinions. In these cases, the intellectuals themselves can be the ones pulling the levers of power, and genuinely believe that what they are doing is for the greater good. Perhaps paradoxically, other intellectuals are then still likely to be among the targets of their oppression: namely, those independent spirits who disagree with the approved ideologies of the regime.\nMore sympathetic fictional depictions may show the intellectuals as misguided sympathizers of the Evil Overlord du jour either because they Draco in Leather Pants said Lord for some reason or other, or see them as Byronic Hero and Not Evil, Just Misunderstood, which the villain might even invoke to better manipulate said intellectuals to serving as tools and builders of their Cult of Personality. This is a good variation on Not Brainwashed, and it provides a more nuanced and gray look at such conflicts to better explain why La R\u00e9sistance is always on the back foot to The Empire.\nArchetypes that are similar but not exactly this trope include Well-Intentioned Extremist, Mad Scientist, Evil Genius, differing from this trope in that it better fits villains or Villain Protagonist. Intellectually Supported Tyranny are not really main characters but usually supporting players, and where the other archetypes commit evil actions believing them to be good, such figures know fully well that the actions are tyrannical but are both \"necessary\" and \"correct\". Given that they tend to reference actual totalitarian governments, dystopian works often have the heroes interacting with this type, who tends to have power in a paradoxically anti-intellectual state. For the good version, where the state is ruled by intellectuals but this is presented as a good thing, see the Philosopher King.\nIn real life, all states and systems of government have more or less \"official\" philosophers, ideologists and journalists who promulgate and propagate their respective ideologies, and this has demonstrably been so at least as far back as we have written records. Naturally, tyrannies are no exception. However, precisely which historical (or worse, present-day) regimes qualify as \"tyrannies\" is a matter not everyone is likely to agree on, and debate over the said matter would be overwhelmingly likely to produce more heat than light. Therefore, No Real Life Examples, Please!\n"}
{"FumblingTheGauntlet": "In an unfamiliar social environment, a character does something that he thinks is mostly innocuous, either intentionally or by accident. Unfortunately, in this society, said act constitutes Throwing Down the Gauntlet, and will result in him engaging in a Duel to the Death, possibly on the spot. Oddly enough, the people from the local culture never seem to grasp the concept that different cultures do things differently, so they never understand the poor foreigner's plight, and he does not get a free pass for not understanding the gravity of what he just did. Sometimes this is justified by them being Jerk Asses who do this sort of thing deliberately.\nSee also Accidental Marriage for other results of innocuous gestures.

{"HetIsEw": "Some people are fans of Slash \u2014 the Shipping of two same-sex characters from a fandom together. Some people take this a little further though; they don't just like Slash but also dislike the idea of Shipping two opposite sex people together, even if those doing the shipping are themselves straight.\nThis is a subculture-within-a-subculture. This can range from people who merely prefer to pair off every character they like with another of the same sex to the more extreme people who appear to argue that writing slash is a politically liberating act. Queer fans, for example, may have an averse reaction to the heteronormativity of the media and respond by augmenting queer representation in a work. note\u00a0 The counterargument is that most slash is about as realistic about same-sex relationships as your average Space Opera is about physics. And while it is true that there's a lack of queer representation in mainstream media, it's also true that Playboy has high-quality articles  Occasionally it can be an unexpected by-product of backlash against the addition of Mary Sue Original Characters, or authors pairing up the male characters who are perceived to be more interesting than the female ones. note\u00a0 Ironically, this means the fanfic writers are even worse about female character inclusion than the mainstream media producers  This led to a widespread perception among Fan Fic writers that Slash Fic with the canonical male characters is automatically of \"higher\" quality than a male/female pairing, which was assumed to be the (female) author's Wish Fulfillment.\nThe extreme versions are the kind who write hate mail to authors for daring to give their male shipped characters a wife, and impose Die for Our Ship on any female character who so much as has sexual tension with one of \"their\" guys, often in the most sadistic and humiliating ways. Other times, people proclaiming that Het Is Ew are just tired of the ubiquity of het romance plots in all variety of fiction and the tropes that go with them, particularly the stereotyping of everyone involved. (Ironically, said heteronormative romance dynamics frequently show up in the slash genre as well, with one character still playing a stereotypical male role, while the other takes a stereotypically female one, sometimes up to getting pregnant.) The sentiment is also somewhat common among jaded and vengeful subsets of queer/trans people, who take to describing straight characters with the same disdain that queer relationships are often treated with. Despite this, the intensity of the extremists has been known to scare artists away or make them outright refuse to draw yaoi or yuri (or at least force them to write under a different name).\nCounterintuitively, there may be a homophobic element to this trope in some cases; straight people who subscribe to the notion may feel that their own sexuality is threatened if they find a work that includes a member of their own sex arousing. This is one of the reasons for the prevalence of lesbian porn aimed at straight men; viewers don't need to worry about being turned on by another guy. There is also an air of misogyny with people who endorse Het Is Ew since not only are female-female pairings much rarer than male-male ones note\u00a0(even in franchises with prominent female leads like Alien or Once Upon a Time), the women in het ships get the most hate and slash pairings often kill off or demonize the female characters in order to enable ships with men only. There's also a case for elements of biphobia, where romantic relationships involving characters of the opposite sex are attacked or invalidated as heteronormative for being mutually exclusive with the capacity for same-sex attraction, even when one or more of the characters involved is already canonically bisexual. Finally misandry is also an arguable factor, as there is the assumption that a male cannot have emotional closeness to anyone - even family members - without sex being a factor.\nFor fanfic writers who are not interested in the extremist hate invested in Die for Our Ship, they instead often Ship the person \"in the way\" with a different person in the cast who is the same sex as them; i.e., if they Ship Bob and Dave, but Alice is Bob's Canon girlfriend, they write fics about Alice realizing she actually loved her best friend Carol all along, rather than about Alice dying in a house fire. This isn't universally true, but it's not uncommon, either. Basically, when these fans write Fan Fic, Everyone Is Gay.\nIt's worth noting that this is a fan-reaction Trope, dealing with the preference of a number of slash and yaoi fans to read about only homosexual relationships. It's not about in-universe anti-heterosexual feelings expressed within a work of fiction.\nDepending on what circles you run in, this can actually be a joke, usually about why they don't write \"gen\" (\"general\") fic.\nSee also Het. Not at all related to finding the Dutch ungendered equivalent of \"the\" ugly or disparaging the Russian word for 'No'.note\u00a0 Unmasked Cats and Harlequin Babies notwithstanding. Pre-pubescent boys may feel Girls Have Cooties, but that usually changes when they're older.\nIn-Universe examples only please, and remember, this is about a specific attitude towards heterosexuality, not just homosexual pairings.\n"}
{"FamilyUnFriendlyAesop": "Everyone knows the Stock Aesops: Be Yourself; appreciate what you have; people are more important than things; follow your dreams. Sometimes, these morals contradict each other, but nobody is surprised to see any of them in a story. However, sometimes a story aims to teach a lesson well outside the pale of accepted wisdom. For example, \"No Good Deed Goes Unpunished\", \"It's okay to Be a Whore to Get Your Man,\" or \"Sometimes Violence Really Is the Answer\".\n\"Family-Unfriendly\" does not necessarily mean \"wrong\": the lesson may be both true and well-supported in context, but it frequently jars the audience since they weren't expecting it. After all, most shows, especially ones aimed at children, teach viewers that they should help the less fortunate, be modest, and solve their problems without coming to blows.\nWhen your work promotes a lesson that is seldom taught and/or contradicts general morality, you have a Family-Unfriendly Aesop. Your audience may not be able to argue that you're \"wrong\", but they'll still walk away feeling a bit uncomfortable.\nNote that being \"jarring\" is not necessarily the same as being pessimistic. Some more optimistic Family-Unfriendly Aesops might be, for instance, \"peer pressure is good for you because it convinces you to try new things\" (or, conversely, \"Rejecting the wisdom of the crowd could end badly,\") or, \"Having sex reduces stress and makes you happier, so go have some.\" Note also that how the Aesop is conveyed may be what makes it family-unfriendly: for instance, Good People Have Good Sex almost always gets a far friendlier reception from Moral Guardians than You Need to Get Laid, though both promote sex as a good thing.\nA Family-Unfriendly Aesop is not the same as a Clueless Aesop, which is a moral (usually a family-friendly one) presented so ineffectively that the audience either misses the point or doesn't find it at all persuasive. When delivered straight and effectively, the Family-Unfriendly Aesop jolts the audience entirely because the message they figure out is exactly the one the writers wanted them to catch. Nor is it the same as Broken Aesop, wherein a show contradicts or otherwise undermines its own (again, usually family-friendly) moral.\nDue to Values Dissonance, a moral that is family-unfriendly in one culture may be very family-friendly in another, especially morals about social mores or civil rights. This list is for morals that were family-unfriendly even for the culture for which they were written. A prime target for dropping anvils.\nNote: A work may depict a character behaving in a certain way without promoting that behavior as good (let alone telling the audience that they should do the same). Before adding an example to this list, think about whether the example is actually preaching a moral, or if it is simply telling a story to entertain (i.e. a Downer Ending does not mean it is trying to teach a lesson that life is pointless). If it's not the point of a story, it's not An Aesop. An unusual moral also doesn't count if it's played for laughs (Spoof Aesop). If it started out as a good moral, but was broken, that falls under Broken Aesop. If most people would've considered it a good moral when the work was made, but Society Marches On, it's Values Dissonance or Fair for Its Day. If you are drawing absurd conclusions from a story which doesn't have a moral, take it to Warp That Aesop on Darth Wiki. All in all, try to keep presumptuousness to a minimum in interpreting what the story's message is.\nCompare Clueless Aesop and some cases of Unfortunate Implications. See also The Complainer Is Always Wrong.\nNote: Understand that not everything needs or has an Aesop. A depiction is not an endorsement.\n"}
{"Shounen": "Manga and anime aimed primarily at teenage boys. Traditionally aimed towards boys between the ages of 12 to 18 years. They tend to be Fighting Series focused more on action than relationships, with romance generally either perfunctory or Played for Laughs. Some battles can be sublimated into a form such as a sports competition or even a Tabletop Game.\nWhile there was a time where protagonists could be adult men the target audience would look up to, it's more common for the title character, and most of the cast, to be predominantly teenage or young adult male, equally capable of action and Ham. Lots and lots of ham.\nNote that while the term \"Sh\u014dnen\" tends to be used to refer to a few standard genres, it literally refers to the target demographic (and in Japan, generally refers strictly to manga, rather than anime). Its older counterpart is Seinen, although both are enjoyed by other audiences as well. The Distaff Counterpart to Shonen is called Shoujo.\nThere is no definite marker for a series being or not being Sh\u014dnen. Though the magazine it runs in is a good indicator, many Sh\u014dnen magazines aim for the huge Seinen Periphery Demographic that also purchases them. Some of this is a natural result of the franchise Growing the Beard together with the audience: many series that are popular with the Seinen demographic (and marketed towards such in omnibus tankoubon volumes) have run in Sh\u014dnen magazines when they were serialized. Some long running series will \"graduate\" to a magazine for an older demographic to follow its aging audience. While the same can't usually be said of series with a strong Shoujo and Josei periphery, some authors throw a bone their way by writing exclusive installments for magazines of those demographics.\nThemes are not a definite indicator either: while most Sh\u014dnen works (particularly the action fighter types) tend to fall in the idealist side on the scale of idealism vs. cynicism, there are also plenty of works with Darker and Edgier elements and outright Deconstructions that can easily be mistaken for a Seinen series and evoke a What Do You Mean, It's for Kids? reaction (Death Note and Neon Genesis Evangelion are some of the notable examples). That being said, light and fluffy/dark and moody romance, serious female-led dramas, and cute art styles aren't limited to Shoujo manga either, as stories like Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san and Azumanga Daioh can attest.\nDue to Values Dissonance, some Sh\u014dnen series are primarily marketed towards adult fans in the West; as such, most of [adult swim]'s anime lineup consisted of Sh\u014dnen. One of the most illustrative examples of this is Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, a highly idealistic Hot-Blooded, bright and cartoonish Super Robot series that aired as the equivalent of a Saturday Morning Cartoon in Japan but debuted on Adult Swim, uncensored, in the US.\nSh\u014dnen series were the first to be brought over en masse to the Western world, and as such, makes up much of the popular American perception of anime.\nThis is because it is, perhaps, the genre most similar to heavily actionized, Rated M for Manly Western Animation shows of The '80s, also largely geared towards teenage males with swaths of Multiple Demographic Appeal. (Pure shojo bounces between the realms of cutesy and melodramatically scandalous for most Media Watchdogs, so it does not get shown in the West as much.)\nSee also: So you want to Write a Shonen Series\n"}

Noise is where it's at, the louder the better!\nIn fictional depictions, the audio quality is inversely proportional to how funny the scene is, so if it's a comedy, the guy standing next to me will always end up with busted eardrums since I'm answering his questions through the megaphone, but when I'm addressing the audience at large, expect a lot of\u2014 loud pitched squeals\u2014and don't forget\u2014 no sound comes out for whatever reason!  smacks the megaphone a few times\nStart listing some examples, folks! This trope isn't about to write itself, you know!\n"}
{"TheHiddenHour": "The Hidden Hour (a.k.a. the Witching Hour) is a period of time within the average day that is Invisible to Normals; most people don't experience it, nor are they aware it even exists at all. Only a few people, often those with some kind of special power, know about this extra hour; and only they are able to act during it. To these people, when The Hidden Hour occurs, normal clocks stop ticking, Muggles freeze in place (or vanish entirely), and strange things start to happen.\nThe Hidden Hour frequently occurs When the Clock Strikes Twelve, due to the association between midnight and magic. However, this is not about magic simply being at its strongest around midnight, nor is it about planets whose day-night cycles are naturally longer than 24 Earth hours.\nIt's interesting to note that an extra hour added to a twelve-hour clock would be the thirteenth hour. You've got to ignore the fact that there are really 24 hours in a day for this to work, but numerology has never been shy about fudging things for the sake of Rule of Drama...\nIn spite of the name, The Hidden Hour is not necessarily 60 minutes long; it frequently lasts as long as the plot requires, which to those involved may feel like several hours, or possibly even days, before the Hidden Hour ends and normal time resumes.\n"}
{"CripplingOverSpecialization": "Competitive Balance exists so that there is some symmetry between specific advantages and the Necessary Drawback. If someone can hit hard but are easily hurt, they are a Glass Cannon. If they are unstoppably strong but slow moving they are a Mighty Glacier. A crippling overspecialization occurs when an obscenely powerful advantage makes a trade-off that limits how effective it is.\nIn some Real-Time Strategy games, unit types are often specialized beyond all reason. They often have only one weapon, effective against just one particular kind of enemy, and usually cannot defend themselves at all if their particular weapon is ineffective. The most prominent examples can be seen in this genre: explosives will deal low damage to infantry, while Anti-Aircraft cannons can't defend against ground units. This is usually a result of game balance. After all, if tanks are effective enough against other tanks and infantry, then why build anything else? Additionally, until recently, most units in games were depicted with only one weapon. A few might've had a second gun used for attacking enemy fliers, but that was about it.\nCan result from a Tactical Rock\u2013Paper\u2013Scissors design scheme, or from intensive Min-Maxing in a character build.\nPeople who do this for Elemental Rock\u2013Paper\u2013Scissors are suffering from Poor, Predictable Rock.\nSee also Anti-Air and Strong Flesh, Weak Steel. Compare to An Adventurer Is You, where this is used to force players to work together. See also Sacrificed Basic Skill for Awesome Training for a characterization equivalent and Single Task Robot for a robot equivalent. Severely Specialized Store is a comedic variation.\nDon't confuse \"having a weakness\" or \"not being the best at everything\" or even \"not being quite good enough\" as being this trope. Don't be tempted to list something because it failed in some way unless you can point a finger at its crippling specialty!\nThe opposites of this trope are the Red Mage, Jack-of-All-Stats, and Master of All. At the other extreme that loops right back is Master of None, where the character has no great specialization... but sucks at everything anyway.\n"}
{"NoSenseOfHumour": "A character with No Sense of Humor is incapable of enjoying jokes, comedy, or humor of any sort. Maybe the character is The Stoic turned Up to Eleven, or an otherworldly being with no notion of comedy, or the victim of a traumatizing accident \u2014 whatever it is, this person is unwilling (or unable) to respond to humor, tell jokes, or even recognize when something is funny at all.\nSome characters with No Sense of Humor maintain their seriousness by sheer force of will. Others might have a conceptual understanding of humor, but simply treat it as an odd curiosity or with a clinical detachment. Oftentimes, such a character is placed in absurd situations to elicit laughs from the audience.\nA common characteristic for The Stoic, The Spock, and the Grande Dame.\nArguably a subtrope of No Social Skills depending on the culture. May overlap with Evil Has a Bad Sense of Humor and Sarcasm-Blind. Also see Late to the Punchline, Don't Explain the Joke and Cannot Tell a Joke. Dude, Not Funny! is a completely different trope, but in-universe, one can be confused for the other depending on the character.\n"}
{"InconsistentColoring": "Sometimes, characters' colors aren't consistent from one moment to the next, whether it's a very notable miscoloration in one panel, or consistently recolored across an entire issue. It's typically small details, such as eye color, but more major details, like hair color or costume colors, can be changed too.\nIt may be due to various artists. Maybe publishing issues. Maybe they're retconning or deliberately redesigning an outfit from here on out. Maybe they didn't care.\nIf it's actually supposed to be changing In-Universe, it also be due to things like dyes, different lighting in different environment, magic illusions, or shapeshifting, or some other explanation.\nThis is particularly prevalent in comics, including western comic books, newspaper comics, manga and webcomics, but can happen with other media as well. Is frequently due to different artists but can also be due to retcons or just the artist being Off-Model.\nCompare to Depending on the Artist, Adaptation Dye-Job, Early Installment Character-Design Difference, Hair Color Dissonance, Unreliable Illustrator. Not to be confused with Eye Colour Change, which is where a character's eyes legitimately change color as part of the story.\n"}
{"IntroductoryOpeningCredits": "At any point during an opening sequence, the main characters will appear, each in a separate shot, with their names beside them. There are many reasons for this, but the most common is simply so the audience knows who's who before the show actually starts. On occasion, especially in live action shows, the actor playing the character will also be listed.\nIn long running shows where characters are Promoted To Opening Titles, expect Evolving Credits. If two characters are introduced at once, that's Diagonal Billing.\nRelated to Framed Face Opening, Fun with Subtitles on occasion, Casting Gag also on occasion, and Boss Subtitles. For the version at the end of the show, see Video Credits.\nCompare to - and sometimes used in conjunction with - Theme Tune Roll Call, where the opening theme of a show introduces the characters, often with shots of the characters as they are named by the song.\n"}
{"CallaPegasusahippogriff": "The daughter trope of Our Monsters Are Different and Call a Rabbit a \"Smeerp\".\nSo your characters are on an adventure in a Magical Land, and they naturally run into a mythical creature. Said creature is then identified in the text or dialogue by the name of a different mythical being or fantasy creature. Cue a moment of confusion for the viewer.\nThis could be employed just to underline in red crayon that Our Monsters Are Different. Alternatively, of course, the writer did no research \u2014 or did a little too much research, finding an extremely obscure name or form of a familiar creature. This is a common cheat when fishing for names for Palette Swap Underground Monkeys.\nThis isn't quite Sadly Mythtaken as the very fact that the writer knows that mythical creatures have specific names implies doing some research. (Sadly Mythtaken is more for The Theme Park Version / Disneyfication of classic myths.)\nIn case you're wondering, the most commonly accepted generic term for Winged Horses is \"pterippi\" (which is Greek for, well, Exactly What It Says on the Tin). However they're often simply called \"pegasi/pegasus\" after the most famous example \u2014 see A Kind of One.\nCompare Istanbul (Not Constantinople), which is similar but for place names.\nWhen a completely fantastical character is named after a commonly-known creature, see Call a Smeerp a \"Rabbit\", which is a sister trope. The title is a takeoff on Call a Rabbit a \"Smeerp\", and is a reference to one of the best-known examples.\n"}
{"UndergroundLevel": "Underground levels, carved out of endless expanses of rock, are among the favorites of video game designers, primarily because they can shape these tunnels and cavities to any sizes, shapes and lengths they desire without having to resort to the Insurmountable Waist-High Fence.\nSometimes known as the Underworld, this setting appears frequently as a direct contrast to The Overworld as it is where the hero goes when he enters a cave or falls in a hole. It could be an Empty Room Psych, a full fledged dungeon, or anything inbetween.\nVisitors may encounter Bottomless Pits, falling rocks, stalactites, breakable walls, giant mushrooms, lava, an underground lake, and/or minecarts. Goddamned Bats abound, and watch out for the monkeys. Visitors will probably not encounter stalagmites, because game designers prefer flat, uninterrupted floors for the characters and enemies to walk along (though stalagmites may show up from time to time as the cavernous version of Spikes of Doom). The music often gets more low-key and adds drums and bass.\nIn most cases, light is strangely never a problem \u2014 it might be darker than usual, but you've always got enough to see by (maybe there's some sort of glowing fungus). Oddly enough, although spiders are common, Cobweb Jungles are not.\nAn extremely common variant when it overlaps with Crystal Landscape for a crystal cave, featuring quartz and precious gems gleaming wall-to-wall with All-Natural Gem Polish. No one ever considers mining them out, because they're just there to look cool. And wouldn't you know it, sometimes the crystals are ice crystals.\nThe RPG version is usually either a fairly difficult dungeon with little reprieve, or the very first one, used as an introduction.\nMay at times overlap with the Absurdly Spacious Sewer or Blackout Basement. If there are people living there, see Underground City and Beneath the Earth. May also encompass the literal Underworld, though that usually gives it elements of Lethal Lava Land or Big Boo's Haunt.\n"}
{"RegularCaller": "In action, adventure or drama shows, the protagonists need a Call to Adventure. Every. Single. Episode. In a series with low seasonal fluidity, a single call may last for an entire series, or at least a few episodes. But if Failure Is the Only Option, then don't be surprised to see a Call happen once a week. Originality is hard, so expect to see writers fall back on the same Call frequently. When the same Call comes on a semi-regular basis or even every episode, this is a Regular Caller.\nWhen done well, it ties into the premise of the show and follows logically, and when done poorly it comes off as contrived and risks breaking suspension of disbelief. This trope is ubiquitous in things like Police Procedurals, Medical Dramas and Courtroom Dramas.\nThe Magnetic Plot Device can overlap with the Regular Caller, however the Magnetic Plot Device is usually just an in universe justification for the Regular Caller. The Bat Signal is one specific kind of Regular Caller. Compare Prophecy Pileup, when this happens with prophecies related to a Chosen One.\nAnime & Manga\nComic Books\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nPuppet Shows\nVideo Games\nWeb Comics\nWestern Animation\n"}
{"OutsourcingFate": "The Powers That Be can't decide what to do with the future of the universe, so they ask the opinion of The Everyman protagonist.\nThe Hero is obviously not qualified for choosing the fate of mankind, at least by traditional standards, but the Powers That Be have a good reason to trust him. Maybe he's The Chosen One who is predestined to have the correct choice, the Ridiculously Average Guy who somehow represents all of humanity's opinions, or maybe, a more personal Powers That Be simply finds him sympathetic.\nSo The Hero has to use his best intuition, and make a choice that will influence everything.\nThis whole situation is closer to the idealistic side of the scale, so usually the protagonist's choice will also be the more daring, fantastic, and optimistic option.\nCompare to Humanity on Trial, when the humans have to convince the Powers That Be to accept their will, instead of themselves getting trusted with making the right decision.\n\"End of the World\" Special is an extreme version of this trope.\n"}
{"EveryOneCallsHimBarkeep": "A Sub-Trope of No Name Given in which a character is not just a \"victim\" of Only One Name, but is only known by his job title or some other descriptive moniker, or an obscure or odd word that functions as an unusual nickname.\nDifferent from Only Known by Their Nickname, in that it is actually describing what they do. If the character initiates it, it's Spell My Name with a \"The\". May be the result of a Nameless Narrative or Featureless Protagonist. For parents, see Unnamed Parent. Related to They Call Him \"Sword\". Compare/Contrast Race Name Basis when race is used for this and the character may or may not have a name and A Dog Named \"Dog\".\nWhen it's not just a moniker but their actual name, it's the subtrope His Name Really Is \"Barkeep\".\n"}
{"OrangeAndBlueMorality": "To say that questions of morality are thorny and filled with gray when they aren't being hammered between stark absolutes is putting it mildly. Because of this there can be great drama when characters who represent a wide range of moral viewpoints come together or into conflict.\nThe strangest of these characters are those who espouse Blue and Orange Morality. These characters have a moral framework that is so utterly alien and foreign to human experience that we can't peg them as \"good\" or \"evil\". They aren't a Chaotic Neutral Unfettered, though they may seem to act terrifyingly randomly; nor are they necessarily a Lawful Neutral Fettered, because our and their understanding of \"law\" as a concept may not even be equivalent. There might be a logic behind their actions, it's just that they operate with entirely different sets of values and premises with which to draw their conclusions. It's also worth noting that such cultures are just as likely to be something we'd find appalling, as they are to be something we'd find benign and/or weird. They may also find us appalling, benign, or weird even if we don't see them that way.\nAnd although they are often likely to commit acts we would see as horrific, some are unusually benign. Either way they tend to act as if nothing were the matter. Because in their world/mind, that's just what they do. This trope is one of the trickier to pull off well, because Most Writers Are Human, and it's often hard to portray alien and truly foreign. Because of this, it's not uncommon for audience members to label these characters as Designated Heroes or villains due to human audiences often lacking the experience or knowledge that these fictional characters have. Audiences must remember that these characters are meant to be Morally Ambiguous.\nThis is similar to Values Dissonance, but the main difference is that societies with Values Dissonance can, at least on a basic level, generally measure one another by the same concepts of Good and Evil, or even Order and Chaos. With Blue and Orange Morality, the values are so foreign, that such concepts can no longer be applied. They may not even know what these things are, or even if they do, will often find them confusing. The concepts are not necessarily beyond their grasp, mind you, but just aren't something which they'd place any importance on.\nConversely, they may have these concepts, but apply them in vastly different ways. Such as regarding motionlessness as the epitome of evil, or viewing exploration as an element of chaos.\nNote that cases involving solely a misapprehension of facts and consequences do not count here no matter how alien the reasons; if, for example, a race of aliens thinks killing is okay because its own members respawn within a day with no harm done, and mistake humans as working the same way, that doesn't mean they wouldn't balk at killing if they realized the degree of harm it causes to other creatures. In this case, they may be working by comprehensible moral standards and just gravely mistaken about the implications of their actions.\nLikely candidates for Blue and Orange Morality include The Fair Folk, who follow rules of their own making; Eldritch Abominations that are beyond comprehension; the more exotic Starfish Aliens; AIs and robots, especially when super smart and/or incapable of emotion. An individual human (or single members of any species whose majority falls into darker morality) who operates on this is the \u00dcbermensch of Nietzschean philosophy (a human being who has developed their own Blue/Orange set of morals). A Nominal Hero may have this motivation as well. Moral Sociopathy overlaps strongly with this trope for obvious reasons, though this is not always the case.\nCompare Xenofiction, Humans Are Cthulhu, Humanity Is Infectious (all often involving this), Above Good and Evil, Affably Evil / Faux Affably Evil (they sometimes can come across as this), Even Evil Has Standards (when handled poorly or bizarrely), Evil Cannot Comprehend Good (less elaborate forms that resemble this in practice), and Non-Malicious Monster (which occasionally requires this), and Obliviously Evil (when a villain thinks that his actions are acceptable or helpful). When two sides go to war and nothing will stop them except total annihilation, that's Guilt-Free Extermination War. If the character genuinely knows everything will turn out okay, allowing the plot to treat them as a good guy no matter how cruel, irresponsible or fascist this makes them by our standards, that's Omniscient Morality License.\nHas nothing to do with the following: Bucknell University, The University of Illinois, The University of Virginia, The University of Florida, Auburn University, Syracuse University, Hope College, Gettysburg College or Boise State University (the colors of all of which are blue and orange, albeit different shades in each case). Nor the Denver Broncos, Chicago Bears, New York Knicks, New York Mets, New York Islanders, Edmonton Oilers, or Mango Sentinels. Or the City of New York, for that matter. Furthermore, do not confuse with Blue and Orange Movies (even if they do overlap). Also has nothing to do with the Karma Meter in Mass Effect nor the Aperture Science Hand Held Portal Device or even the light scheme in TRON and its universe.\n"}
{"TimeParadox": "A contradiction of causality within the timeline brought about by Time Travel. Theorized to be dangerous to the fabric of reality, and known to be dangerous to the brains of anyone who tries to get their head around them. So don't. It's usually what The Professor worries about during a Time Travel story.\nPunishments for creating a paradox vary. You might instantly vanish from history or cause your time-travelling self to be erased; you might be immune but find the world around you different; you might destroy reality itself; heck, you might even accidentally unleash killer flying time monkeys.\nThis is all fictional, of course. In reality, a confirmed paradox would disallow time travel to work at all. You see, a logical paradox is not a thing. It is a sign in a human-created model that either you have attempted something impossible or that you have incomplete understanding of how something works. Here's the thing: all our notions of causality are based on the fact that time only moves in the one direction and a paradox exploits this cause and effect relationship. Once you throw Time Travel into the equation and have time move in a different way, it's really anyone's guess what will happen. Not that this prevents authors from abusing the concept as a sort of universe-wide Logic Bomb.\nThere are many kinds of paradoxes that can be created by poorly thought-out time travel, but it usually fits one of these two major categories:\nThis paradox gets its name for a very simple question: \"what would happen to you if you went back in time and killed your grandfather before he had offspring?\" (Parodied by Futurama; see example in Stable Time Loop)\nMore generally, this means doing something that makes your time travel impossible or unnecessary. For instance, if success in the time travel endeavor means that the condition you set out to change never happens, then you won't ever have had any reason to come back and try to change it. Thus, without your intervention, it will happen after all, meaning you then must go back to change it, meaning you don't have to, meaning you have to, and so on, ad infinitum.\nMost cases of Mental Time Travel sidestep or ignore the grandfather paradox.\nThe kind of paradox that occurs in a Stable Time Loop if you're not very careful about what you're doing, involving events that are their own causes. While not a paradox in the strictest sense - events remain self-consistent - it does violate normal expectations in surprising waysnote\u00a0Quantum physics comes into play, see discussion. Common variations include:\nWhere did the glasses come from in the first place? The glasses have literally sprung into existence from nothing, appearing to violate the law of conservation of energy/mass. This is sometimes called a \"closed timelike curve\" in hard SF.\nHow does the object escape erosion or other forms of damage? Since its origin point is also its end point, the object cannot (relative to itself) loop endlessly as it would experience infinite decay (relative to itself) and therefore would not exist to be sent to the past, preventing the loop from occurring at all. Thus, to exist the object must (improbably) escape all forms of damage/erosion/entropy between its arrival and departure; technically, this isn't impossible, but its improbability makes object loops very weird from a quantum mechanics perspective.\nIn one common variation, information loops, rather than physical objects: for instance, an engineer from the future gives the formula for transparent aluminum to its historical \"inventor\", becoming the creator of a metal that has always existed. This version may avoid the problem of decay, provided that the information is correctly transmitted and recorded. The actual effect of this variation is that no one invented the object, or no one discovered the formula/concept. It's just there.\nThe object could also be repaired, or otherwise reset to a certain state, at some point during its existence; this would be the closest to creation the object experiences. This is a variant of an information loop, in that the object contains or suggests information (what it should be like) that is used (along with whatever remains of the damaged object) to create the like-new object.\nThus, an ontological paradox occurs, which is not actually a paradox in the logical sense, but a confusing and counter-intuitive result of time travel. This also precludes a multiverse explanation, since both child and rescuer-adult occupy the same timeline and universe, if the child has a childhood-memory of being rescued by the adult-self.\nNormally, as written, the temporal paradox never turns out to be as dangerous as The Professor imagined it would be, or it turns out the characters were \"supposed to do it\" in the original timeline. The latter ontological paradox is also known as a predestination paradox, and the resultant philosophical questions are rarely thought about in the series.\nIf two time periods are featured, the effects of a paradox will usually be visible in the future only \"after\" the cause has happened in the past (see Meanwhile, in the Future...).\nInterestingly, series rarely have the same result to paradoxes even in the same show.\nThe most common effect of a paradox, on TV at least, is to trigger the Reset Button and unmake the entire episode's consequences.\nTheoretically, a paradox that consists of two mutually-exclusive events can have one of two results: either the fabric of reality rips itself apart trying to determine which reality is the 'correct' one, or \u2014 according to Multiverse Theory \u2014 it's discovered that causing a paradox is a technical impossibility, as each supposed 'paradox' merely creates two 'alternate' timelines \u2014 one for 'Situation A' and another for 'Situation B'.\n(Of course, Multiverse Theory also holds that time-travel is hypothetically possible \u2014 since every choice made, and every action taken, and every word ever written, creates a series of 'alternate universes', each being slightly different to account for the results of the choice/action/word, we would just need a consistent way to travel 'between' the various 'multiverses' thus created.) On the flip side, it also means that it's impossible to completely Set Right What Once Went Wrong, as the \"original\" timeline will always be unchanged.\nCompare Timey-Wimey Ball, Stable Time Loop. If time is somehow dangerous besides from paradox, it's Time Is Dangerous.\n"}
{"Mithril": "Mithril is a fictional metal from J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth fantasy writings. It is silvery and stronger than steel but much lighter in weight. The author first wrote of it in The Lord of the Rings, and it was Retconed into the second, revised edition of The Hobbit in 1966. In the first 1937 edition, the mail shirt given to Bilbo was described as being made of \"silvered steel\". This metal was the reason for the Dwarves of Khazad-d\u00fbm's wealth and power. Greed for this metal eventually led to the downfall of the dwarves when they found a vein of mithril that led to a sleeping Balrog.\nThe name \"mithril\"note\u00a0For the curious, mithril in Sindarin (Elvish) means \"grey glitter\", the -ril part being the same as in Silmaril. In Quenya (the classical language of the Elves) it was  mistarill\u00eb. or similarly spelled variations (mithral, mythril, mythral, and others) is present in other fictional contexts like role-playing games, since the Tolkien Estate did not trademark the term, unlike \"Hobbit\" or \"Balrog\". One early example is Dungeons & Dragons and its derivatives (e.g. Forgotten Realms). It appears in many computer and video games such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (it also appeared in The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, although there it was a mid-weight material), EverQuest, RuneScape, Tales series, Dark Age of Camelot, Dungeons & Dragons Online, Diablo, Terraria, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy,note\u00a0Final Fantasy curiously makes mythril a very low-grade metal obtained in the early-game, as opposed to the stuff of legend it typically is. Kingdom Hearts and NetHack. The name is usually used for a special type of metal (often used as armor), or as a denomination of currency, or as a name for a project or device. It's very useful to have an exotic trope metal that is more rare and valuable than mundane metals like steel or gold. Citadel Miniatures even produced a color of (metallic) paint named Mithril Silver.\nAs to whether Mithril was ever based on a real metal, Tolkien never said. Guesses for this metal have been aluminum, titanium, naturally occurring titanium-molybdenum alloy and platinum (and yttrium silver if you want to get technical). Titanium comes closest in lightness, hardness, toughness and resistance to tarnishing, yet it is not found whole in nature, it has to be extracted from minerals via a complex process which could not be discovered and put in practice by a non-industrial civilization. Unless they had magic....\nSubtrope of Fantasy Metals. Compare with Thunderbolt Iron, Orichalcum, Unobtainium, Silver Has Mystic Powers. Contrast with Cold Iron.\nNot to be confused with Heavy Mithril, or the fictional mercenary organization of the same name.\n"}
{"LightisNotGood": "The Light seems like a good, kindly thing, especially compared with that bad old Darkness. Whereas Darkness is usually concerned with kicking puppies, eating children, and laughing its head off, the forces of Light generally worry about nicer things, like singing with the birds, helping little old ladies cross the street, and... well, you know, being a Hero. Whereas the Dark is sexy and alluring and tends to dress that way, the Light (while often quite attractive in its own way) tends to be a bit more conservative when it comes to clothing. Women serving the Light tend to really appreciate this, considering what the Darkness usually makes its women wear. Whereas the Darkness seems to revel in lawlessness and chaos, the Light tends to prefer law and order, providing for properly maintained roads, a court system, and safe cities.\nWell, This Is Not That Trope.\nIn one of those instances where you should Beware the Nice Ones, the Light isn't always what it appears to be. Sometimes, a battle with an obviously Light-wielding character will not result in Defeat Meaning Friendship or an Epiphany Therapy, but will just end with a laser-scorched corpse and the shiny happy killer skipping off to continue using their sunshine-fueled powers to wreak decidedly unholy havoc. There is a reason why the word \"Light Bringer,\" in Latin, literally means Lucifer.\nIt turns out that, just like how, sometimes Dark Is Not Evil, sometimes Light Is Not Good. Some will view the Light itself as natural, and darkness as nothing more than an absence of it. Others will see Light as a destructive force, a perversion of the infinite all-encompassing Darkness.\nThis Trope is an inversion of the standard that \"Light = Good\". Like with Dark Is Not Evil, Light Is Not Good can subvert or avert a number of other Tropes depending on how it comes into play \u2014 usually Beauty Equals Goodness and Good Colors, Evil Colors, among others.\nLight and Dark are both oversimplified metaphors for Good and Evil, not truly synonymous terms. Looking at the matter rationally, too much sunlight causes burns, sunstroke, skin cancer, and drought, which is bad; whereas nightfall and sufficient shade provide relief and rest, which is good. So, neither physical brightness nor physical shade can be all good or all bad. Elements are properly value-neutral. note\u00a0It should be noted however that there's no reason to think Humans equate light with good and dark with bad for any reason other than nature instilling it in us since we cannot see in the dark.\nThe mildest form of this Trope involves beautiful, charismatic villains dressed in white and surrounded by religious symbols. A step further features a villain who wields Light as an elemental power. Whether by technology or magic, they can bend physical light to their whims, displaying such powers as beauty-enhancing sparkles or an angelic glow, optical illusions and holograms, Mind Control through Laser-Guided Amnesia, blinding flashes, and laser beams. For artistic contrast and further deconstruction, they might be opposed by a hero who uses shadows and darkness as Elemental Powers.\nCrapsaccharine Worlds are often depicted as highly polished, brightly (sometimes too brightly, e.g. Mirror's Edge) lit, and cheerful almost to the point of cloying. Of course the true nature of the society is gradually revealed over the course of the narrative, making it an instance of this trope.\nAnti Heroes generally fall under Dark Is Not Evil rather than this Trope unless they're a Knight Templar, for instance a ruthless Church Militant who works with the good guys. Light Is Not Good is when a character is directly bad, directly villainous \u2014 and still has Light powers. Depending on characterization, they might be sympathetic, perhaps well-intentioned but horribly misguided. Or the person could be the most gleefully twisted bastard imaginable.\nCommonly used with Fallen Heroes and Knight Templar. Often used together with the Path of Inspiration or Corrupt Church. Perhaps might even go so far as to cast aspersions on a Council of Angels. At the most extreme, it declares God Is Evil. May well occur in a villain's Yin-Yang Bomb, in which case the heroes probably need to produce one of their own to combat it.\nSee also Pure Is Not Good, Face of an Angel, Mind of a Demon, Man in White/Woman in White, Lawful Stupid, Good Is Boring, God Is Evil. May result in Good Powers, Bad People. Often overlaps with Light 'em Up and Holy Hand Grenade. Oh, while we're at it, Frickin' Laser Beams are made of light too. Fire can be applied to this as well, as well as electricity and ice, as well as the blinding flash provided by Nuclear Weapons or an gamma ray burst or asteroid/comet impact. In this case, see also Bright Is Not Good, which only applies to colors. Not related to Good Is Not Nice, though the borders can be fluid.\nIts counterpart in the whole Order vs. Chaos scheme is Order Is Not Good.\nKeep in mind that stories where Light Is Not Good does not automatically enforce Dark Is Not Evil. In Fact, stories where Dark Is Evil and Light Is Not Good are commonplace to show that the light can be just as foul as darkness. In addition, some stories may use BOTH Light Is Not Good and Light Is Good at the same time, with good light based characters calling the evil ones Hypocrites.\nThis trope is not an Obviously Evil character such as a Bedsheet Ghost wearing white, although they may fall under Bright Is Not Good. To qualify a character must fit with what is culturally thought of light. A angel wearing bright clothes with White Magic or simply a classical unicorn as the villains are good examples; a simple Corrupt Church cleric or a white-haired handsome youth simply using their attractiveness to get away with misdeeds is pushing it depending on who you ask; a clown wearing white makeup but otherwise not bright coloured, not attractive or not possessing holy powers is most definitely not. Someone is is beautiful but otherwise not light related in any way is definitely out. Add a sun (powers, jewelry, name, whatever), however, and we're listening. And an Eldritch Abomination with light powers is definitely in.\nRelated to Daylight Horror. Occasionally the Sun expresses this trope in fiction, either as sun powered villains or as evil or creepy disembodied heads representing the Sun. See also Hiding Behind Religion, which can be considered a more realistic\nversion of this trope.\nHas nothing to do with Light Yagami not being good, although Rule of Symbolism makes him an example.\n"}
{"AscendingToAHigherPlaneOfExistence": "The character ascends to a higher state of being, even becoming a god. It can result from other supernatural causes, but is most often used as a character's fate after they die, in a riff on the idea of a heavenly afterlife.\nIt is mostly a way to pay off a character. Or play off, in some cases. A way to put the character on a bus, though that's not all that it's used for. If the writers should need the character back, it can be very easy to reverse, in which case the character will De-Power as a God in Human Form. Sometimes the accession isn't even meant to be permanent if the writer needs some way for a character to enter a higher plane, then leave with something important like knowledge or a new power. If the character has left their clothes behind, untouched, it's a case of Shapeshifting Excludes Clothing.\nThe Singularity can cause whole populations to ascend.\nExpect examples of this trope to make use of the words \"ascend\" and \"above\" in line with Heaven Above, where the divine and supernatural are associated with the sky above us. Compare Winged Soul Flies Off at Death. Contrast Cessation of Existence.\n"}
{"MundaneGhostStory": "A mundane ghost story is a scary story involving rational worries rather than implausible phobias.\nSomeone tells a Ghost Story in classic fashion, probably around a campfire or with a flashlight aimed up under the face, only the ghost story is about something that is not really scary in the traditional nightmare sense, but is more like Adult Fears: being stuck in a loveless marriage, living an unfulfilling life, sexual inadequacy, and so on. This is usually played for laughs, avoiding anything involving physical pain or death, dealing with something sillier like having to wear a stupid outfit to school, having a bad haircut, or eating something that tastes terrible.\nThis type of scary story usually bypasses fantastic and/or supernatural horrors found in the common ghost story, for something that tends to actually happen in real life to sane people.\n"}
{"WarTimeWedding": "The atmosphere of a lot of war stories is generally saddening and depressing, if not outright horrifying. That said, when a writer thinks that enough is enough and that these poor characters need a bit of happiness in their lives without deviating from the somber war genre, then what better way to show that than to have two characters get married?\nThe Wartime Wedding is a great way to put a Hope Spot in a war story in order to lighten the mood. Among other things, a marriage symbolizes love and unity and can remind the characters that things such as happiness still exist. At the same time, the usual joy of the Wedding Day is undercut by the tragedy of war.\nThis can come in three types (but is not limited to them):\nThe Star-Crossed Lovers are subject to this a lot of the time in war stories. Expect the couple to Altar the Speed. Compare Married at Sea. Beware the possibly unmarked spoilers!\n"}
{"DidNotSeeThatComing": "Ah, nothing denotes how Crazy-Prepared The Chessmaster is like the good old Gambit Pileup. Truly, there is nothing these twelfth-level omni-geniuses have not contemplated in their equations and planned for with contingencies B through Z42t.\nThen something, or someone, happens. Not just something that the Chessmaster didn't know about, but something that he didn't know he didn't know. In fact, there was no way he could have known that he didn't know this. Thus the brilliant plan goes to pieces, with a deadpan \"I Didn't See That Coming\" once the dust settles. Less Stoic fellows may go Oh, Crap! or into Villainous Breakdown, though usually it's a Spanner in the Works that causes that reaction.\nA plotter who is aware that these can appear, builds flexibility into his plan, and improvises when they arise, is playing Xanatos Speed Chess.\nFor a brief analysis of what usually qualifies as this trope, and what usually doesn't, see this page.\nCompare Spanner in the Works, which very often is the unknown factor. See also Didn't Think This Through. If there wasn't a plan to begin with, possibly due to a plotter knowing this will happen the moment they start, it's an Indy Ploy.\n"}
{"AirWhale": "Large flying creatures are a staple of Fantastic Fiction. This trope comes in a few distinct flavors:\nNote that Giant Flyers can be either literally gigantic or just relatively large compared to the other characters. Compare Our Dragons Are Different, Dragon Rider, Feathered Fiend, Eldritch Abomination, Ptero Soarer, Roc Birds, Space Whale, Living Gasbag, Living Ship and Winged Humanoid. See also Giant Swimmers.\nIn Real Life, the largest flying birds are limited by the manner in which avian flight feathers grow, and historically have never been much bigger than even modern condors and albatrosses (wingspan about 3.5m) with the exception of the condor-like Argentavis and the seagoing Pelagornis sandersi (both with wingspans perhaps up to 7m). Pterosaurs evolved to be much larger, but then anything bigger than a Quetzalcoatlus (wingspan about 10m) is running up against the Square-Cube Law \u2014 it gets really difficult to take off, since the wings become too heavy to overcome their own weight, let alone the rest of the body. The largest bird species generally spend most of their flight time gliding rather than flying, and prefer to land on a high point rather than the ground, as they tend to need a downward dive at the beginning of a flight to build up momentum. In fiction, if any effort is made at all to explain why an overly large flying creature can exist, the go-to explanations are low-gravity planets and magic.\nNot to be confused with large airplanes and airships; for those, see Cool Plane, Cool Airship, and Plane Spotting.\n"}
{"PosthumousSibling": "One of the most traumatic situations a family can deal with is the loss of a child. The wound cuts deep into both individuals and relationships. It is agony to speak about and somehow the silence is worse. The entire world seems to come to an end.\nAnd yet, life goes on.\nThe desire to be a parent doesn't pass with the loss of a child. After time has passed they may decide that the time has come to have another child. This subsequent child can come with psychological ramifications that don't exist with other children.\nThe parent(s) may treat the child as a Replacement Goldfish, or struggle with keeping the child from feeling like one. Fear of losing another child can cause a Mama Bear or Papa Wolf to develop into full blown My Beloved Smother.\nOn the other hand the child may struggle with never feeling good enough. It can be hard enough to struggle with comparing to an older sibling, it can be downright impossible to compare with the unlimited potential represented by that older sibling's death.\nMy Sibling Will Live Through Me and Two Siblings In One can be related; specifically if the child is born close to the older sibling's death.\nSince this is a Death Trope, expect unmarked spoilers below!\n"}
{"EveryGirlIsCuterWithHairDecs": "Any decoration a character (almost always a young girl) wears in her hair\u2014bands, clips, flowers, ribbons, tiaras, you name it\u2014to make herself look younger and cuter. A grown woman wearing one looks childish, though a character with Rapunzel Hair might be able to get away with cool-looking decorations; a male character (regardless of age) wearing one looks silly (and, of course, his sexuality will be called into question), making this an Always Female Trope. (Except in Yaoi Genre, where cute young guys can wear barrettes or hair clips. Or when Real Men Wear Pink is in play.)\nMostly used in anime, if the author has Only Six Faces, but the relatively mundane setting doesn't call for the more outlandish Anime Hair or even nonstandard Hair Colors; the next best way to distinguish heads is by having the girls wear their hair up with increasingly iconic accessories. Especially prevalent if the main character has brown hair. They're also commonly paired with Girlish Pigtails.\nThe type of hair decoration also tells you something about her age. Double-orb hair clips and Alice bands are usually worn by preschool girls, while middle- and high-school students prefer ribbons. A particularly common decoration is a ribbon tied into a huge bow. This is more common for elementary or middle school children, and usually signals innocence.\nSometimes this overlaps with Tertiary Sexual Characteristics: you know it's a girl because she has hair decorations. Naturally, she'll be cuter.\nOccasionally part of a Nice Hat, Frills of Justice, and/or Pimped-Out Dress.\nCompare Pink Means Feminine, Long Hair Is Feminine.\nSupertrope to Flower in Her Hair.\n"}
{"NonhumanUndead": "When most people think of The Undead, they tend to think of the formerly human rising up from their graves or something similar.\nThis trope, on the other hand, is about those whose life started out \"fantastic\" even before they joined the ranks of the dead. Whether they were an Elf, a Dragon, a Demon, or even something completely divorced from reality, the one thing common among them is that they're all dead (or at least resemble some combination of some sort of traditional undead and its own base species) and still kicking.\nYou may even see an Undead God. In that case, you should run, run as fast as you can.\nSee Raising the Steaks for undead animals (where examples of such should go there instead of here).\nSee Hybrid Monster, when two living fantasy species are combined. Contrast Hybrid Overkill Avoidance. Also, compare Mechanical Monster and Ninja Pirate Zombie Robot.\nThe Grim Reaper and other Psychopomps can be one, depending on their origin.\nDracolich is a specific subtrope when the creature turns out to have been a dragon.\n"}
{"EverythingsSpoonierWithSpoons": "No idea why, but spoons are funny somehow. Maybe it's because \"spoon\" belongs to the Inherently Funny Words. Interestingly, the word \"spoony\" has nothing to do with actual spoons. - Even better than ordinary spoons are sporks.\nIf you want to add examples, keep in mind that they should be at least somewhat funny. This trope isn't about \"Spoons Exist.\" Or people named Spooner, or such.\nNo relation to a certain Spoony Bard. Or that other Spoony. Or Spoonerisms.\n(Needs a Better Description.)\n"}
{"ImaginedInnuendo": "What happens when, in-story, Alice starts interpreting statements by Bob to be a variant of Double Entendre. Most common if Alice has either been given misinformation by a third party, or if she's simply not intelligent enough to realize what it is that Bob is actually referring to. Almost always, Hilarity Ensues.\nCan result in I Didn't Mean to Turn You On.\nNot to be confused with the Accidental Innuendo, where it's the audience who got the wrong impression. Compare and contrast Innocent Innuendo and Un-Entendre.\n"}
{"StaringThroughTheSword": "One of the Stock Poses: a character holds his or her sword upright, with the blade between his or her eyes, often followed by Stab the Sky.\nThe pose originates in the European Swordsmanship tradition. When saluting a superior, a Worthy Opponent, or the audience, the swordsman would bring his sword-holding hand in front of and close to his throat, with the tip pointing up and slightly forward, then slash down sideways, so the point stops near the floor next to his right foot. According to The Other Wiki, this custom originated during The Crusades, when the knights kissed their swords as makeshift crucifixes before charging into battle. Nowadays, it is mostly seen in competitive fencing, but has also seeped into all kinds of media thanks to the sheer awesomeness of the move.\n"}
{"CreepyAwesome": "A character who, despite (or precisely because of) being Nightmare Fuel, is also greatly loved by a series' fandom. This can have a variety of reasons. Maybe the character is simply the biggest badass in the show, or maybe they have a cute, funny or tragic side in addition to their creepy side that endears the character to the fans. The character in question need not be a villain, though a majority of characters this trope applies to are villains or at least antagonists of some sort.\nThis sometimes results in Misaimed Fandom and Draco in Leather Pants. Note that while these characters are often Nightmare Fuel incarnate, their appeal to non-Nightmare Fetishists is often due to being more appealing (e.g., Magnificent Bastard, The Woobie, etc.) than creepy. May or may not overlap with Creepy Good. Love to Hate runs on a similar principle, and given that many examples of creepy characters tend to also be evil, the two tropes can easily overlap.\nAlso, characters that remain stoic throughout the entirety of a show's story automatically qualify here due to lack of emotions, interest or involvement naturally these characters sprout up mystery and uncertainty. At worst these characters are downright terrifying once they finally decided to get involved with the cast, due to lack of understanding the cast would assume these characters are either dangerous, untrustworthy or non-human. It is common for the less intelligent characters, to foolishly meddle with these characters, something they often regret eventually once the latter reveals how emotionlessly twisted they really are.\n"}
{"TheShowGoesHollywood": "A sub-trope of Vacation Episode, where the characters visit Hollywood in Los Angeles, California.\nIt allows for potential celebrity cameos and advertising for the studio or network. Since most American films and TV shows are filmed in southern California (particularly in the Greater Los Angeles Area) anyway, this trope allows the show to use actual locations in southern California and the Greater Los Angeles Area instead of just faking other parts of the US.\nIt frequently involves the characters getting temporary gigs in the entertainment industry (most commonly getting a role in a movie or TV show \u2014 or even both in some cases). It is likely a case of the writers writing what they know.\nSister trope of Aloha, Hawaii! and Viva Las Vegas!, which are two other major touristy areas in the USA. Compare Who Would Want to Watch Us? for the inverse situation (Hollywood comes to the characters to adapt their adventures into an in-universe movie or TV show).\n"}
{"BlueOrangeContrast": "We'll start off with a little warning. After you have read this, the color combination will be everywhere you look. It will follow you around, haunting you. Thankfully, for most people this effect fades after a few days.\nBasic complementary color theory states that when two contrasting colors are put together, they \"pop\", so the natural technique is to color films to have a strong, contrasting palette.\nThe one thing you will almost always have in a film is people. Human skin runs from pale pinkish yellow to dark brown, all of which are shades of orange. The color that contrasts best with orange is blue. So you turn up the shadows to the cyan end and the highlights to the orange.\nWhile other pairs of complementary colors are associated with specific concepts, fiery orange and cool blue are strongly associated with opposing concepts \u2014 fire and ice, earth and sky, land and sea, dawn and dusk, invested humanism vs. elegant indifference, good old fashioned explosions vs. futuristic science stuff. It's a trope because it's used on purpose, and it does something. Especially in theater, orange and blue are sometimes referred to as amber and teal in this context.\nIn the modern context, this trope has gone beyond simple colour grading and into set and costume design for the grading later. For example, a room might have blue walls and a brown cabinet with an amber lamp while the female lead is in a yellow dress, all of which can be colour-graded to create the OrangeBlueContrast. If the female lead has orange hair, expect the male lead to often wear blue clothing to contrast with it. If you wish to die of alcohol poisoning, take a shot every time the set and costume design dovetail to force the contrast.\nMore here, here and here. Games have also picked up on this trend. A discussion of the coloring trends \u2014 especially in orange as they pertain to comics \u2014 is here.\nSubtrope of Mood Lighting and sister trope to Unnaturally Blue Lighting, as well a very specific and common form of Color Contrast and Color Wash. Not to be confused with Blue and Orange Morality (even when it overlaps with Good Colors, Evil Colors, as in TRON: Legacy). Ties in with Hollywood Darkness, which is usually blue or teal, and often accompanies a Fire/Ice Duo.\nHas a vague resemblance to the Loudness War; in both cases, something is pushed Up to Eleven in post-production, removing all subtlety from the sound or picture. Can be a factor in Digital Destruction. See also Red/Green Contrast.\n"}
{"CommutingOnABus": "\n\n\nA character who at one point was a major character on a show is, instead of being written out entirely, put in a situation where they will appear sporadically as a Recurring Character. This could be because the arc that featured that character has come to an end or, much more likely, the actor is getting ready to leave and this is an excuse to phone in another season. Often accomplished by the character getting a promotion, moving farther away, put into a coma, etc.\nCompare The Bus Came Back, where the downgraded character only returns once or returns to stay. Compare also with Out of Focus.\nOpposite of Fake Guest Star, as the actor often has their billing copy-pasted from a previous season's credits.\n"}
{"UnObtainium": "Unobtainium is engineering jargon for, \"a material that would be perfect for our purposes, if we could get it, which we can't.\" Sometimes an object that actually exists, or existed at one time, becomes unobtainium because it's unavailable now. When used in the realm of fiction, Unobtainium is usually the exotic material that is needed to make the Applied Phlebotinum of a given story work. Without it, all your nifty machines and plot-enabling gadgets quit functioning.\nSome forms of unobtainium are based on real physics, but beyond the current scope of human engineering, such as room-temperature superconductors; they would revolutionize just about every form of technology, but they are not in and of themselves dangerous or based on some exotic physics-bending principle.\nOthers are more fantastic \"high-grade\" unobtainium, such as antimatter, which would be a revolutionary way of storing huge amounts of energy, if it didn't violentlynote\u00a0as in, 1*10^-9 grams = tactical nuclear weapon yield undergo mutual annihilation with any conventional matter it comes into contact with, including air molecules and the walls of whatever you're trying to store the damn stuff in.\nThe most common varieties of unobtainium in fiction sit somewhere in the middle, like materials so resistant to heat and/or damage as to be Nigh Invulnerable compared to other, similar substances. Materials such as mithril are the fantasy version. Thunderbolt Iron is especially popular in fiction (and has some basis in reality \u2013 until smelting was invented(which takes ridiculously hot - 1250 \u00b0C or 2282 \u00b0F - furnaces, hence the term \"Iron Age\"), it was the only source of refined iron).\nMuch mad science uses unobtainium, such as chemicals with impossible properties, universal solvents that can dissolve anything in the blink of an eye, super-explosives that make nitroglycerin look like a weak cough, and plenty of other funny-colored solutions. Following this would be medical and/or chemical wish-fulfillers; Classical real-world alchemy casually referred to carmot, the base substance of the Philosopher's Stone, and Azoth, either the \"universal medicine\" or \"universal solvent\". The ancient Greek writer Plato referred to \"Orichalcum\" (Greek for \"mountain bronze\") in his description of Atlantis.\nIn Science Fiction, it will usually take one of three flavors: whatever stuff makes Faster-Than-Light Travel possible, closely followed by the stuff that can mess with gravity (if they're not one and the same), and finally, the stuff they make Humongous Mecha and Alien spacecraft out of, which is why they tend to be effectively immune from earthly weapons or environmental damage.\nFor Willing Suspension of Disbelief, authors may pick out something actively being researched within the scientific community at the time of writing and run with it. Naturally, this risks dating the work when Science Marches On and today's \"super technology\" buzzword becomes the next generation's comic-book junk science. The current favorite in hard sci-fi is Helium-3 \u2013 believed by many to be the fuel of choice for those nifty fusion reactors that should be perfected any time now. Theoretically, it's a safe large-scale energy source with few environmental side effects. But more importantly, though, there's extremely little of it on Earth; on the Moon, it's Not Rare Over There \u2014 which would provide a good reason to go there.\nThe term \"Unobtanium\" originates from aerospace engineers in the late 1950s, where it was used as a Hand Wave for a material sufficiently strong, light, and/or durable to meet the needs of a particular situation under discussion, even if no known material could possibly do so. It has occasionally been used in official discussions to avoid directly identifying a material whose use is still considered top secret (such as the titanium skin in the project that eventually produced the SR-71 Blackbird). Most people, however, first heard the term as the mineral sought by the mining company in Avatar, and mistakenly think that is the Trope Namer.\nSee Also: Minovsky Physics when the Unobtainium has well-thought-out properties that are strictly adhered to, and its opposite, Green Rocks, when it can do anything and everything the plot demands.\nCompare Mineral MacGuffin, Spice of Life and Fantasy Metals.\n"}
{"Biodata": "Information: the lifeblood of modern (and likely, future) civilization.\nIt can be stored in analog form, in digital form, or in organic form, on an organic or even biological matrix. When the latter is used, it's frequently depicted as persons smuggling information in a biomolecular format (amino acids, for example, seem to be a common matrix for this type of information storage). Related to (real world theories of) organic and biomolecular computing. It's an emergent technology in Real Life, but it's been played straight in Speculative Fiction at least since the early nineties, and probably before that. It's present in Cyber Punk and Bio Punk, but also pops up in other subgenres of Speculative Fiction like Space Opera, usually for the purpose of espionage, or as a message from an ancient race of Precursors to descendants. It's a given when dealing with Organic Technology, and Wetware CPUs. A retroviral encoding vector is another significant variation.\nThis does not cover the opposite, where information about a biological organism is recorded by digital computers or otherwise non-organic devices. That's a separate trope. Also does not cover inorganic storage system implants, for example in Johnny Mnemonic. A silicon memory chip in the brain is not an example of this trope; but a port implant that allows Memory Uploading from computer to brain or brain to brain would count: it all depends on the storage medium.\nSee also Genetic Memory, for which this is sometimes given as a Hand Wave. A staple of Cyber Punk and Bio Punk, but as mentioned, common in other genres such as Space Opera.\n"}
{"StockEvilOverlordTactics": "So you're a villain with an Evil Plan that you want to accomplish, good for you! However, a plan is nothing without a, well, plan with which to execute it. This trope is about the Stock Evil Overlord Tactics used to accomplish the Evil Plan.\nBe sure to consult the Evil Overlord List for more in-depth help on the topic. I Control My Minions Through... shows different means of getting and controlling underlings.\n"}
{"EvolvingWeapon": "Just as characters can get stronger and change overtime, so too can some weapons. Absolutely no modifications are made to these weapons, they just get stronger over time. Typically justified with a Living Weapon or Empathic Weapon or a weapon born of its user's power. Occasionally the weapon has a sort of vampiric nature, and gets stronger by drinking the blood of its enemies.\nHaving an evolving weapon allows the hero to carry it throughout extended lengths of gameplay without the weapon becoming obsolete and underpowered, thus making it a bit of a trademark of the hero and highlighting how awesome it is. By unlocking its powers bit by bit, you also avoid having a weapon too good for early game.\nAlternatively, there is a second way this works. Instead of the power gain being permanent, sometimes it is only temporary. Maybe it unlocks some of the weapon's hidden abilities, or there might have been something special about what was just killed. Subtrope of Empathic Weapon. Can serve as a Full Potential Upgrade or keep that trope from occurring in the first place.\n"}
{"PaperFanOfDoom": "It's just an ordinary, if large, paper fan \u2014 accordion-pleated white paper, taped at one end to form a handle. But some characters wield them the way others do the dreaded Hyperspace Mallet, and get much the same results \u2014 the unfortunate target usually goes rolling down the street from the force of the blow.\nSometimes used as a symbol of dubious authority, the paper fan (or harisen in Japanese) has roots in the Japanese equivalent of vaudeville comedy, particularly of the slapstick variety \u2014 and like an actual slap stick it makes a lot of noise with little real hurt. It is the tool of a tsukkomi, or \"straight man\", of a standard two-man comedy team in a kind of routine common to the Kansai region called manzai; it's used to upbraid the other member of the team (the buffoonish boke) when he says or does something foolish. Naturally, this has been carried right over into anime and, being a tradition stemming from the Kansai region, it should be noted that, usually, either the wielder or the target are The Idiot from Osaka.\nThis may go back even further though, since fans with sharpened metal ribs were allegedly used as weapons of war and assassination, being particularly suited to the latter due to ease of disguise. (In fact; there are arts about using fans, as well as fans made for weapons). For such weapons, see Combat Hand Fan, though these two tropes can overlap.\nA similar western version is the archetypal rolled up newspaper. Compare Dope Slap. If the paper fan is used as an actual weapon, see Combat Hand Fan.\nHas nothing to do with the dangers of fans with exposed rotating blades.\n"}
{"AlwaysFemale": "An index of characters that are female at least 90% of the time. A male Wholesome Crossdresser, or a Gender Bender living in a female role can also fill these roles.\nFor the other 10%, see Gender-Inverted Trope (aka. a \"rare male example\").\nCompare Always Male.\nSee also Unisex Tropes.\n"}
{"Dreamland": "A Magical Land or Another Dimension comprised of dreams. Can be a collective dream, or the dream of a specific person. Generally surreal, nonsensical, and psychologically symbolic. Alternatively, just adorable randomness. Usually divided into two halves or factions\u2014nightmares and good dreams.\nFor some reason, adventurers in Dream Land will seldom run across the myriad sexual dreams humanity experiences. Odd that, as you'd think there'd be a huge Red Light District.\nMay provide a setting for Talking in Your Dreams.\nIn medieval Europe it was commonplace for a writer to situate a story in Dream Land, as a way of apologizing for the fictional quality. As fiction became more respectable, the Dream Land became chiefly used for fantasy works, as it provided a reason why the Magical Land does not obey ordinary laws of nature. As fantasy became more respectable (for certain values of \"respectable\"), the Dream Land came to be used only in fictional settings relying on actual dreams. Still, this makes this Older Than Print.\nHas nothing to do with the Dream Land on Pop Star (despite being the Trope Namer) or the Julien K song \"Dreamland.\"\nSee also Dream People, Dream Apocalypse. Not to be confused with a Magical Land which is accessed through dreaming (or to be more precise, sleeping and having your consciousness transferred).\n"}
{"TheatrePhantom": "The Phantom of the Opera, based off the book and play, is a considered by many to be one of the best movies of all time due to its gripping combination of drama and horror. The title character himself is very intriguing, being a masked madman with a lot of tragedy and sadness has made him one of the most iconic villains (if not characters) in movie lore.\nAs with most successes, the concept of a \"phantom of the X\" has since been used countless times since its introduction. In comparison to the original, characters based on the Phantom are often varied. Sometimes they are a Captain Ersatz, sometimes they're a thoughtful parody of their inspiration, but they often share a few key features:\nIf a character like this does appear, don't expect much reference to the original story. The Theatre Phantom may act similar to the Trope Namer in the original story, but often the other characters and the plot of the original work will never be alluded to at all.\n"}
{"HatesBeingCalledCute": "A common Berserk Button for characters with overall adorable appearances is being called \"cute\". If Someone calls them adorable their most common reply is (or is a variation of): \"Don't Call Me Cute!\" and perhaps something more aggressive.\nThe reasons vary for why the character dislikes being called cute, but most of the time is because in the mind of people (or even in the mind of the character, if they're insecure), being called cute/adorable means they are weak, not fitted for the job, or being judged based on (and only on) their appearance. The character wants to prove themselves worthy.\nTomboys are another common user of this trope because being cute is generally thought of as a Girly Girl trait, and so this trope can serve to contrast them. If a tomboy doesn't mind being called cute, than that is likely their girly streak.\nIt can overlap with Break the Cutie, Cute Bruiser or I Just Want to Be Badass. Contrast Kawaiiko, who are trying way too hard to be called cute.\n"}
{"LazyArtist": "Many graphical tropes are simplifications, used to make the scene easier to draw. Books are always open in the middle, bite marks are smooth, and so on.\nReplace \"lazy\" with \"low-budget,\" \"time-limited,\" or \"unskilled\" as appropriate.\nA Sub-Trope of Limited Animation, specifically the sub-type that makes the format so infamous.\nProminent examples:\n"}
{"Midquel": "Also called a Midquel, this can be one of two things: when a new entry in a series is a sequel to one existing entry, and a prequel to another, or when it takes place during a Time Skip in an earlier entry rather than continuing the story. This device is often used to expand a portion of the story only touched upon in other entries, or if more story is desired but there's no logical place for it either before the beginning or after the end.\nThe two terms are sometimes differentiated, where an \"Interquel\" is referred to as an entry happening strictly between two previous ones of the franchise (i.e. Movie 3 takes place between Movie 1 and 2), while a \"Midquel\" takes place within a single work of the franchise (i.e. Movie 2 takes place within a Time Skip in 1). But continuity can sometimes be so convoluted (depending of whether it is an Immediate Sequel or not, or whether The Stinger overlaps with events from the other works), that establishing a work is in-between two others will usually suffice.\nCompare Prequel, P.O.V. Sequel. Not to be confused with Simultaneous Arcs which is a story that takes place at the same time as another story, but focusing on different characters.\n"}
{"IfYouKillHimYouWIllBeJustLikeHim": "The hero has finally subdued the hordes of evil, thwarted the Evil Plan, and subdued the Big Bad in one final showdown. However, the villain couldn't make things simple and die in battle. Now he's helpless at the hero's feet and\u2026 the hero stops. Maybe he throws away his weapon and says, \"I'm not like you.\" Maybe he was about to kill, but his companion shouts something like, \"You're better than him!\". Maybe the villain taunts them about being Not So Different. Either way, he refuses to kill.\nThis trope is grounded on the basis that the act of killing is always wrong, no matter who it is directed against or how well-deserved, or even if it is done with the hope of preventing more evil in the future. This can come across as slightly disingenuous if the hero has slaughtered his way through dozens of faceless mooks just to reach the villain, only to hesitate or spare him at the end because \"killing is wrong.\" In such a scenario, only Character Development can make the disparity make sense.\nIf a villain clearly deserves death, he may become a self-disposing villain, or suffer a Disney Villain Death, or be killed by his own men or another evil character. This way the villain is dead, and the hero gets to walk away scot-free and blameless for his death.\nIn such cases, killing is treated as a special kind of evil. Even things like eternal imprisonment or horrible maiming are treated as more moral than a quick death. Anything really, just so long as the hero doesn't kill. A Technical Pacifist is likely to go along these lines.\nIt's common to see this in Crime Drama shows where the police have cornered the killer-of-the-week, and a would-be victim/relative of a victim has the killer at gun point, ready to kill them; generally, the police officers will opt to use this line in an emotional speech in order to get them to stand down so they can arrest the killer.\nContrast with Kill Him Already!. Compare with Save the Villain and Sword over Head. Anti Heroes are exempt. Compare/Contrast Strike Me Down with All of Your Hatred. When this is played literally or when it leads to a Full-Circle Revolution, it can be a case of You Kill It, You Bought It. Often What Measure Is a Mook? gets involved as these dilemmas arise when important baddies are at the heroes mercy but rarely do such sentiments pop up when they are mowing down waves of faceless goonsnote\u00a0And more often than not the story will play out in a way so that mooks never surrender or are incapacitated.\nA subtrope of He Who Fights Monsters and Moral Dilemma. See If You Taunt Him, You Will Be Just Like Him for when the stakes involved in this situation are lower. When using this trope, beware of invoking What Measure Is a Mook?.\n"}
{"ValentinesDayEpisodes": "Jewelry, Roses, and Chocolates. Valentine's Day (technically Saint Valentine's Day) is a big deal, and boy do writers know it! The holiday on February 14 has been used a million times in all sorts of media to bring up love and romance. White Day is a similar holiday observed in Japan and South Korea on March 14. In some countries, it's normal to give Valentine's Day cards or gifts to friends and family, whereas in other countries you'd only give a Valentine's Day present to someone you are romantically interested in, leading to a bit of Values Dissonance for certain audiences.\nIn fiction, characters face romantic challenges or break new ground on episodes that revolve around Valentine's Day. A Valentine's Day Episode plot typically centers around hooking up, or with struggling to find the right gift, or with someone (usually the man, usually on some kind of comedy) forgetting about the holiday and struggling to find a suitable gift. There are any number of Love Tropes, comedic love tropes and Sex Tropes that are common to Valentine-centric plots. Can be fertile ground for Shipping Tropes. And likely to be a pivotal part of a Romance Arc.\nWhile many Valentine's Day Episodes will usually air just before or on Valentine's Day, this is not always the case. To be considered a Valentine's Day Episode, a work needs to both explicitly mention Valentine's Day and have a plot focused on love, romance, and relationship, when that hasn't been the sole focus previously.\nAlso in many cases in the media, though Valentine's Day is in the winter (at some latitudes, anyway) it can instead appear to be spring, with no sign of bare trees or snow anywhere, compared to real life.\nFor other holidays see Christmas Episode, Halloween Episode and Thanksgiving Episode.\n"}
{"WakingTheSleepingGiant": "Everyone knows about the Big Good and Big Bad, but what about the Even Bigger Neutral?\nIn most conflicts, there are a variety of neutral parties. From the Precursors to the Retired Badass to the King in the Mountain to the Hidden Elf Village, they always exist, and there's usually one that can flatten both the other sides at the same time, using only a kitchen whisk and a sheet of tissue paper. But don't bother asking them for help, because they will refuse to get involved.\nThat is, unless someone does something stupid or evil enough to repulse them. Whether it was the heroes or the villains, anyone who steps over some inexcusable line will invite their wrath, and this isn't the regular Neutral No Longer give-the-other-side-some-reinforcements wrath... this is \"we have an army of Cthulhu clones\" wrath. Expect an Oh, Crap! from the receiving end if and when the former neutrals start whipping out the doomsday weapons. On the other hand, for the beleaguered side not subject to the proverbial giant's wrath, this is a moment of celebration as they gain a powerful ally and they will fight alone no more.\nThere are two key points to look for before and after this trope comes into play.\nIf the entity is an individual, then they won the Superpower Lottery, and it's likely they are a Martial Pacifist or that they don't see the conflict as something they need or want to get involved in. Sometimes an individual may be involved in the conflict but sees no reason go all out to resolve it. This trope can often cross over with Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass if the character is extremely powerful but doesn't showcase their abilities unless the bad guy(s) set them off. Compare Sealed Badass in a Can, if the \"sleeping\" is in the character of an involuntary confinement and someone breaks the prison. If the neutral party is actually smaller than the two fighting powers, but still enough to alter the balance of power greatly, this overlaps with Kingmaker Scenario.\nA Sub-Trope of Neutral No Longer and related to Heroic Neutral. May serve as a Deus ex Machina and/or Story-Breaker Power (and/or Game-Breaker, if the work is a game) if the giant was an All-Powerful Bystander. Compare Bullying a Dragon and Default to Good.\n"}
{"CruelandUnusualDeath": "Some people die of old age, or gradually succumb to one of a number of illnesses. When death comes, the lucky among us will go out peacefully with dignity. Some of us might go out fighting the good fight, saving the lives of some unfortunate person whom our consciences cannot ignore and force us to help. They'll all die \"good deaths\" (and in some cases, heroic deaths).\nThis trope is not about those people.\nSome deaths not only suck, they suck beyond the telling of it. The extremely painful and particularly gruesome, morbidly embarrassing deaths that leave the deceased absolutely no chance to retain any sort of dignity, forever. Deaths that transcend from being merely \"bad\" into the realm of being \"ugly.\"\nThis trope isn't about just any unpleasant death. Sure, it's bad to get shot in the head...your blood spills all over the floor and you may void your bladder or your bowels. But compared to... oh, being eaten alive from the inside out, getting shot is a walk in the park. It is worth noting that for the most part, creators reserve these events for use as villainous karmic deaths (where the level of horror involved with the death is often part of the karmic punishment) and to get rid of unpleasant people who are Hoist by Their Own Petards... especially the embarrassing type. If this is done to a sympathetic character, on the other hand, it is usually the point where the killer crosses the Moral Event Horizon, if he or she is not on the other side of it already. If they do this on a regular basis, chances are they're a Complete Monster.\nThere isn't necessarily a correlation between the visible gruesomeness of the death and the actual nature of the character's death, some deaths that fall under this trope happen offscreen, and it's the very idea of it that makes it horrific. Deaths with a high horrible factor with less visible content can just as easily fall into scary, though.\nDeaths like this tend to fall into two categories: The first one is where the victim is a rather sadistic villain who deserves it, who you really aren't going to feel sorry for (well, maybe a little...). The second one is where the killer fits that description, and the intent is to show the viewers how sadistic they are (more often than not, it's convincing). Occasionally, the two situations happen in the same work of fiction, with the killer in the second type becoming a victim in the first, which is very much a Karmic Death.\nWarning: The following contains some serious Nightmare Fuel and Nausea Fuel, with a liberal dosage of Squick. Read at your own risk.\n"}
{"SolarAndLunar": "Due to its nature as an object that provides warmth and light, the sun has played symbolic and important roles throughout the history of fiction. Undead or demonic creatures have been depicted as being vulnerable to it, likely to its associations with light and fire. If associated with malevolence, can go in line with Light Is Not Good\u2014imagine sunburns, imagine merciless UV rays scorching everything they touch. This can get even worse with monsters and antagonists that are either made of those elements and/or are able to utilize them without any ill-effect to their being.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the moon also has connotations of light, but it's been associated with The Undead and other supernatural creatures. Lycanthropes, the most famous example, are depicted as having their transformations trigger when the moon is full. Can also go in line with Light Is Not Good, although it can go with Dark Is Not Evil when dealing with characters like Friendly Neighborhood Vampires. The moon does give light in the darkness, and just because it's less constant and more mysterious doesn't make it bad.\nThe contrast between the two is a common motif. Compare Red Oni, Blue Oni and Elemental Powers. Light/Darkness Juxtaposition can apply when the moon is associated with darkness and the sun with light. Given that the sun is a fiery ball of energy and the moon is responsible for the tides, this trope can also lend itself to Fire/Water Juxtaposition. See Night and Day Duo if this contrast is evident in a pairing of characters.\nThe sun and moon have also been personified by having both of them be a specific sex. For example, the pairing could be a masculine and harsh sun paired with a feminine and soft moon. In historical religions, the sexes associated with the sun and moon vary greatly, and in some cases both a male and female deity may be ascribed to a single celestial body. According to The Other Wiki, it is somewhat more common to view the sun as male and the moon as female due to the prevalence of that portrayal in Greek and Roman religion. (It might also have something to do with certain other 28-day cycles.)\nFridge Logic may apply to any reference to moonlight affecting beings or objects, since the moon has no actual light of its own (it's a hunk of space rock orbiting Earth) and its glow is just the sunlight that is being shone on the moon and reflected by it. Hence in theory anything that moonlight should trigger, normal sunlight should actually be triggering as well. Of course, one may then theorize that this light somehow \"changes\" when reflected...\n"}
{"DumbButDiligent": "A person who is not the brightest bulb but makes things work through perseverance, high amounts of enthusiasm and dedication to their leaders and co-workers. They are prone to make very stupid mistakes, even being clumsy, but these moments are minor compared to the level of work they are otherwise able to accomplish. Sometimes their stupid actions may become a problem, but their good work ethic is a factor that keeps them employed.\nThat's not to say they are complete morons. Sometimes just doing a good job efficiently is its own form of brilliance.\nCompare Hard Work Fallacy, contrast Hard Work Hardly Works\nCompare/Contrast Brilliant, but Lazy (where it's talent/intelligence compensating for effort) and High Hopes, Zero Talent (all the enthusiasm with less favorable results). See also Book Dumb, Bunny-Ears Lawyer, Simple-Minded Wisdom, and Inspirationally Disadvantaged. Often overlaps with Idiot Hero if this is applied to the main character, and Happiness In Minimum Wage if the ditzy employee is content with their low-paying job and have no ambitions of promotion. Related to Technician vs. Performer. Also related to Japanese Spirit \u2014 per that trope, this character lacks inner talent but has lots of resolve. Shounen heroes thusly tend to be dumb, but diligent.\n"}
{"BaldofEvil": "In fiction, baldness often equates with lack of moral fortitude. Many, many villains are recognised as such by the audience by their shiny, shaven noggins. It might be the Corrupt Corporate Executive in a political thriller, the sinister evil sorcerer, unholy priest, cult leader, or Evil Overlord in sword-and-sorcery, or a thuggish Giant Mook readying to crack the hero in two. However, it is most commonly applied to the Evil Chancellor and the Mad Scientist.\nWhere the hero has his flowing golden locks or a boyish, tousled mop of red or brown hair to indicate his youthful purity, something about the complete absence of hair makes a bald villain look particularly nefarious, especially while he's slouched on his throne, steepling his fingers and delivering a Breaking Lecture while the ominous backlight shines off his gleaming chrome-dome.\nThis might be a throwback to ancient belief in hair as a symbol of health and virility, as exemplified by the Biblical story of Samson; it may also be more primal still, as a shaven head more closely resembles a skull and, combined with the natural tendency for us to lose our hair as we grow old, is therefore symbolic of aging and death. As a matter of fact, in ancient Rome, baldness was considered a gross deformity. Somehow, that didn't stop the very bald Patrick Stewart from being called \"The Sexiest Man on TV\" in 1992.\nA very specific villain type that provides an example of this is the shaven-headed racist or neo-Nazi skinhead.\nAnother possible explanation is that narrowing the silhouette of the top of the head visually emphasizes the jaw and teeth, making the character look \"brutish\".\nWhatever the original reason, Hair Hates Evil, and about the only times you'll see a kind and moral character without his (or her) hair will be when it's an egg-headed smart guy (who's probably also in a wheelchair), a Buddhist monk, a Bald, Black Leader Guy, or the Littlest Cancer Patient.\nThe only other good guys who go shaven are badass Anti Heroes, so if a hero shaves his head as part of an Important Haircut, it is a sure sign he's about to get Darker and Edgier.\nThe tendency is, indeed, for the moral decay of a character to be inversely proportionate to the length of their hair, with innocent, virginal princesses practically drowning in their romantically flowing locks while the hard-bitten badass sports a spiky military crewcut. The most frequent aversion of this trope is the White Hair, Black Heart, whose usually long and luscious tresses exist as a symbol of his evil, not in spite of it.\nFor the ultimate combination, supply a bald villain with a villainous goatee. This trope is also a function of Good Hair, Evil Hair.\nTaking this trope way beyond its logical extreme, occasional very mad scientists will also shave off their skin and the top of their skull, leaving their brains completely exposed.\nFor aversions, see Bald of Awesome.\n"}
{"PublicDomain": "There are two primary definitions for the term public domain. The one we won't be discussing is public land that can be purchased from the government for a small amount of money and if you homestead it for a few years, it becomes yours.\nThe term \"public domain\" that we will discuss here refers to the collective of works not covered by intellectual property rights in any way whatsoever, usually due to said rights either expiring or never existing, but it can also be due to the creator forfeiting said rights. Examples of such works include the English language, the formulae of Newtonian physics, recipes, the works of Shakespeare and Beethoven, and the patents on powered flight. This also applies to many old movies, cartoons, novels, poems, comics, and various other works of entertainment, science, and general knowledge. In general, Public Domain works make for a great resource for those who would like to use properties in their work, but don't have a lot of cash.\nSince Public Domain works don't have the protection of copyright or other IP rights, anyone can use them as the basis for new creative works without fear of running into lawsuits or other legal issues. Shakespeare's works, for example, have received numerous film adaptations with their own unique spin on The Bard's tales. People can also use those works, in part or in whole, within a new creative work (someone can quote as much Shakespeare as they want within a film).\nIn general, works enter the public domain by one of several means:\nIn the United States, a vast majority of works produced prior to 1924 have fallen into the public domain (with a few exceptions existing thanks to legal issues); works produced thereafter may or may not fall under copyright, owing to a litany of circumstances (including various extensions of copyright terms).\nFor certain works, international laws and treaties complicate matters further. While the King James Bible falls under the public domain in the US, over in the UK, the Crown holds it under perpetual copyright.\nHere on TV Tropes, the Public Domain comes into play via four different tropes:\n"}
{"FlashbackWithinAFlashBack": "Also known as \"Inception Flashback\", a flashback within a flashback occurs when a character recounts an event in which he/she also flashbacks into an even earlier event within the flashback. Yep, it's confusing.\nThese types of flashbacks are used primarily in popular anime/manga to build suspense or burn episode time. Bleach, in particular, uses this trope almost religiously. Do this a lot of times in a row, and you have a Nested Story.\nCan be used in Whole Episode Flashbacks, as a character may recount an earlier episode in which he had an Epiphany Comeback or Heel Realization, usually leading to a scene of Fridge Horror. Can also be used to clarify certain instances of Offscreen Inertia scenes that were skipped in previous episodes.\n"}
{"TwilightOfTheGods": "G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung \u2014 German for \"Twilight of the Gods\"\nThe term was popularized by Richard Wagner in his Der Ring des Nibelungen opera cycle. This is a German translation of the Old Norse \"Ragnar\u00f6kkr\" (\"twilight of the gods\"), which was itself a poetic alternate name for the Norse term Ragnar\u00f6k: The \"ragna\" part (nominative: regin) means \"gods\" or \"the powers\" and \"r\u00f6k\" has several meanings like \"fate,\" \"development,\" \"relation,\" \"cause,\" and, surprisingly, \"origin.\"\nRagnarok was the story of how most of the Aesirnote\u00a0a tribe of the Norse gods, the other being the Vanir and the greatest Jotuns died in a battle against each other. Similarly, this trope refers to when the gods or sufficiently advanced Precursors of a story (and possibly their enemies) either die (if they are mortal) or are Sealed In A Can (if they are immortal), usually in a large battle or some other sudden event. Frequently, this is the end result of a war between gods.\nContrast Death of the Old Gods, where the gods are either slowly disappearing or losing popularity/being replaced over a period of time, essentially going out with a whisper instead of a bang. Also, compare The Magic Goes Away. See also End of an Age / Dawn of an Era, which this trope may end up leading to.\n"}
{"OtakuSurrogate": "So instead, why not have a girl who likes the things that they do? You may not want to use a crossdressing girl or even a tomboy \u2014 just give her a Fan Boy personality.\nA lot of this depends on what the current stereotype of a fan is and finding a fandom that is noticeably gender-skewed (Moe and Humongous Mecha are popular targets) but the cast will still have only one character who is a fan of something stereotypically coded male, and especially for obscure older things the adult audience immediately recognizes.\nAnother bonus to this is that the character's \"masculine\" characteristics are technically arbitrary, and easily tweaked to specific situations. Fans are very willing to put up with a lot of old tropes they wouldn't normally tolerate if the character was actually male.\nContrast Cosplay Otaku Girl and Fangirl. Often overlaps with Gamer Chick and is sometimes part of the Estrogen Brigade.\n"}
{"SonicScream": "The power of sound. Able to shatter glass, crumble rocks, and knock down buildings. In the world of fiction, anyways. Characters who have super-powerful screams or other sound-based superpowers can usually do something like vocal mimicry, scream out sonic booms, and screech so loud it can paralyze people by making their eardrums bleed.\nIt's also interesting to note that in Real Life, versions of this power would be Awesome, but Impractical, seeing as a sonic boom would practically level everything in a spherical radius from the hero (including themselves). Comes with an unusually high level of Required Secondary Powers (most importantly, super-resilient eardrums and respiratory tract), and often involves Acceptable Breaks from Reality \u2014 a visual that indicates the sound \u2014 to depict.\nAn occasional variation has entirely normal people able to use their voices as a weapon against a bad guy or monster who has loud noises as a Weaksauce Weakness. This is often used to subvert the helplessness and pathos often associated with the Screaming Woman.\nOccasionally, characters with this power also have the Compelling Voice ability, if the character has sufficient fine control over it.\nGlass-Shattering Sound is a sister trope for sounds that only shatter brittle materials. A non-weapon and adorable example would be Cute, but Cacophonic. Sometimes combined with Razor Wind. Can overlap with Breath Weapon. Compare Loud of War, Musical Assassin and the sonic variants of Brown Note. For a related but less lethal weapon trope, see Sonic Stunner. Sound sources other than voices that have a physical effect on people or things are covered by Gale-Force Sound.\n"}
{"FinaleCredits": "Many a Grand Finale (and occasionally a Season Finale) will have different Closing Credits than they normally would have. They may use a Solemn Ending Theme.\nSee also Special Edition Title, where this is done with opening titles.\nSince these are the credits of finales, there will be spoilers.\n"}
{"ArmyofLawyers": "Exactly What It Says on the Tin. These are mooks in suits, used for intimidation. When a character in a story feels he's been wronged (or feels he can get away with breaking the law), he'll often threaten to call upon his army of lawyers. Especially when said character is rich. (Sometimes, the army is called \"my legal team\", same diff. In other words, lawyer overkill.)\nSometimes that Army can actually be seen in a show, and when they are, they are invariably marching in ranks behind the character, in step and double-file (and often with an added parodic sound effect of marching jackboots). Occasionally it will be a team of Yes Men or Middle-Management Mooks rather than lawyers, but with the same effect: a martial show of force in a corporate or legal setting. Sometimes the Army will be acting on behalf of an unseen (usually evil) client, all members of the Army working toward one ominous goal.\nCompare Evil Lawyer Joke, You Wanna Get Sued?.\n"}
{"ArmorAndMagicDontMix": "Wizards are often the fantasy equivalent of heavy artillery, capable of wiping out armies by themselves from afar. And like heavy artillery, you don't want them in close combat because they're relatively easy to kill if you can get to them. So why don't they wear armor so they last longer?\nSome settings justify this by having the armor apply a penalty to the mage's powers. This may be because magic requires precise Magical Gestures that are made more difficult by armor's weight. Others use the solution that magic requires such intense study that there's no time to learn how to use armor properly. In still other settings, iron is antithetical to magic by its very nature, or large quantities of metal interfere with the wizard's attunement to the Background Magic Field \u2014 though these still leave the question of why mages are rarely seen wearing at least some form of protective leather or even just a gambesson instead of a Robe and Wizard Hat. Some players otherwise assume the Squishy Wizards are so squishy they can't wear armor without tiring themselves out, which would make some sense when applied to the very long-lived Wizard Classic.\nIn gaming the trope is most commonly used as a way to compensate for Quadratic Wizards for the purpose of game balance, with the intended result being to make magic-users Glass Cannons. In party-based multiplayer, this often results in the heavily-armored warrior's main job being to keep the wizard alive while he casts his spells. It may manifest as spellcasting characters being restricted on which types of armor they can equip, if any, or apply a penalty to the potency of the spell. The trope has been around long enough for that purpose it's arguably achieved Necessary Weasel status.\nClosely related to Squishy Wizard. Compare Armor Is Useless. Contrast Magic Knight, the most common manifestation of this trope's aversion.\n"}
{"MiniDressOfPower": "An Action Girl, from minor to outright badass, wearing a mini dress, either as a one-piece dress or as a top and miniskirt (Bare Your Midriff optional). Often comes with color-coordinated boots ending just below the knee.\nThis requires being an action girl almost full time, not just wearing a mini dress, even as a uniform, or just having a few action girl moments.\nAlso, the length can vary from just above the knees to the equivalent to a Dangerously Short Skirt.\nIn comics it's not as popular as a Leotard of Power or a Spy Catsuit, but other media take to it just fine, particularly Magical Girl and Magical Girl Warrior series. Either expect to see plenty of Panty Shots or it will be a Magic Skirt. Skirt over Slacks, Proper Tights with a Skirt or Modesty Shorts aren't unheard of either.\nSometimes the dress will be simple, and other times it will be a Pimped-Out Dress. It can even start out simple and turn pimped-out through Frilly Upgrade. If the dress is fancy enough, and the wearer badass enough, it can overlap with Kicking Ass in All Her Finery.\nWhile fighting in any kind of skirt or dress is not the most practical idea ever, this trope does reflect reality a little in that A) it's hard to run or kick when you're wearing a tight skirt or dress that's knee-length or longer, and B) a looser, longer skirt or dress might catch on to something. If it is pleated and is wide enough, it will not be hard to run or kick when you're wearing is as with a tight skirt or dress that's knee-length or longer, and if it's short enough it might not catch on to something. Yet these outfits don't provide much protection, and still rely heavily on Rule of Glamorous to work as well as they do.\nThere is, however, symbolic basis for this trope. As popularized by fashion designer Mary Quant, the miniskirt was a mini dress of power in the metaphorical sense, representing the sexual liberation and freedom of the 1960s. Not only did it allow for freer movement than longer dresses, but it also represented rebellion against more conservative dress codes in the 50s and younger women leading fashion trends. Although the miniskirt is no longer as shocking in present times, and its significance as female empowerment remains controversial due to it also being used as Fanservice, producers, particularly women, will invoke this trope to show a female character being both feminine and willing to fight.\nA Sister Trope to Lady Legionnaire Wear.\nCompare Sexy Santa Dress, Zettai Ryouiki, She's Got Legs, Leotard of Power, Superheroes Wear Tights.\n"}
{"SensingYouAreOutmatched": "A great sign of wisdom is the ability to measure your own strength as compared to your opponent's. After all, in order to know how strong you are, you must first know how weak you are.\nThis is the trope for when a fighter bows out of a battle he can't win, or at least knows that his enemy is much stronger than they look. Perhaps it's because he or she is Weak, but Skilled, and has a keen enough eye to see why the other dude is so powerful. Or maybe his Stat-O-Vision lets him recognize that his enemy's Power Level is Over 9000! Whatever the case, he knows he can't win, or at least knows that Underestimating Badassery is a bad idea for those in love with breathing.\nThis could be seen as a Sub-Trope of Know When to Fold 'Em, showing us why a character would give up a fight without trying. Enemy Scan and Readings Are Off the Scale could be how they learn the strength of their opponent, and Screw This, I'm Outta Here! can be the final result.\n"}
{"PlacebotinumEffect": "Having to do with placebos, not places.\nApplied Phlebotinum often works in ways that seem like they should be impossible. Occasionally, however, it really is impossible. The phlebotinum doesn't actually work in the way it's supposed to; instead, the psychic or reality-warping powers of its creator make it act as they intended.\nThis may be an unconscious effect; in this case, the creator will think they really are a genius inventor. It may be conscious, and that's just how their powers work. Either way, they're limited to what they think will work, or what should work \u2014 even if it wouldn't actually work once physics had its say.\nSee also Clap Your Hands If You Believe, Magic Feather, Magic-Powered Pseudoscience, Centipede's Dilemma. Compare the actual Placebo Effect.\n"}
{"RoyalBastard": "He's the son of the ruler of the land. Therefore, he's the Prince, next in the line of succession, and a privileged member of his society, yes?\nNo. Royal Blood aside, he's a nobody. He's a literal bastard, and the reason for the negative connotation of the word.\nBorn with the shame of unmarried parents, he is marginalized at best, reviled and banished at worst (not to mention unable to inherit)\u2014but unlike his more sympathetic counterpart, the Heroic Bastard, the Bastard Bastard is not trying to rise above society's expectations. Instead, his Parental Abandonment has created the ultimate Freudian Excuse. He's the Jerkass Woobie who's got it in for his father, his siblings, or maybe even the world. His issues have driven him to seek revenge, or made him vulnerable to manipulation by the forces of Evil. Generally male, although female examples are becoming more common.\nIn older works, this can be seen as a Space Whale Aesop: Don't cheat on your partner and have bastard children, because they will be evil. In these cases, the bastard's evilness can be a sort of Moral Lamarckism \u2014 that the moral failings of your forebears express themselves in a taint on your own soul or karmic bank balance.\nThis trope can be found in any society where rank or wealth can be inherited, if it also has a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate offspring \u2014 making it Older Than Dirt.\nWhile not exactly a Discredited Trope, the subversion is more common today. Modern audiences have a less stringent view toward children and wedlock and tend to be more accepting of a literal bastard character. While modern settings don't really make use of this trope as plenty of modern fiction deals with settings that draw inspiration from the middle ages\u2014particularly high fantasy, but plenty of other genres too\u2014it'll continue to be relevant for as long as people want to write about aristocracies and so forth.\nStands a good chance of being a Manipulative Bastard. While it's possible, he is unlikely to be a Magnificent Bastard. There's nothing magnificent about this quivering pile of daddy-issues. Don't you dare compare him to his legitimate brother The Evil Prince. Subversions belong to Heroic Bastard.\nA subtrope of The Resenter.\n"}
{"ExposedAnimalBellybutton": "Sometimes when you draw animals on any level of anthropomorphism from Nearly Normal Animal to Petting Zoo People, but especially Civilized Animals, Funny Animals, Petting Zoo People, you just give them a humanlike bellybutton, whether \"innie\" or \"outie,\" that can be seen through their fur, feathers, or scales.\nWhile some cartoon animals have humanlike bellybuttons, Real Life animals don't have navels like this. Placental mammals beside humans are born with a navel that looks very much like a scar.\nOther animals, like monotreme mammals, all birds, most reptiles, amphibians, and fish, most insects, some molluscs, and some arachnids don't have navels, as they are oviparous (were born from eggs). Some squamates (the reptile group that includes lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians) like rattlesnakes, sea snakes, slowworms, and garter snakes, are either viviparous or ovoviviparous (give birth to live young), as are most sharks, live-bearing bony fishes, some species of scorpion, cockroaches, and velvet worms. They don't have navels as navels are exclusive to placental mammals.\nA subtrope of Funny Animal Anatomy and Anatomy Anomaly. See also Nonhumans Lack Attributes. Contrast Belly Buttonless.\n"}
{"JustifiedTutorial": "As games become more and more complex and the basic functions required become more numerous, players become less interested in reading through 20+ pages of manual just to find out how to open the inventory. For that reason, game designers are increasingly relying on integrated tutorials to tell the player what to do as they play through the early parts of the game.\nOne way of doing this is to have the characters tell the player how to do their thing throughout the game. This can be conveniently made diegetic if the player character is a Kid Hero or New Meat, but if the protagonist is some kind of soldier or otherwise trained character it rather spoils the game's atmosphere to make them look like a rookie. It's even worse when the protagonist is being told stuff they already know, and the designers couldn't think of a way to work in a tutorial.\nTo this end, the Justified Tutorial provides a special in-continuity tutorial section which allows the character to \"train\" or learn their stuff without it looking too forced. Sometimes these sequences are integrated into the start of the game; in others, they are optional from the menu. In either case, they are part of the game's universe rather than being self-contained tutorials.\nThe in-game tutorials are sometimes dependent on the difficulty setting, meaning that they aren't present in higher difficulty playthroughs.\n"}
{"IdiotCrows": "When a boke (silly or idiotic character) says something stupid or foolish, one or more crows may be seen flying past, crying \"aho! aho!\" or \"ba-ka, ba-ka\". Aho is Japanese onomatopoeia for a crow's call and the kansai-ben equivalent to the all-purpose insult baka (one functional translation of aho is \"idiot\"); kansai-ben is used by both the Boke and Tsukkomi Routine and The Idiot from Osaka.\nMuch more common in comedy series than serious dramatic anime, but sometimes found at lighter moments in serious series, too.\nNot to be confused with a particular nuclear powered raven who is an idiot or the idiocy of Crow T. Robot. It's not an inversion of Clever Crows, either.\n"}
{"ComicbookTime": "The problem is this. On one hand, Superman is a high-selling, successful character with a lot of licenses and so on based off of him. You don't want him to age or die, because that means losing that successful character. On the other hand, Superman exists as part of a greater universe, and if all the stories in that universe are continuously frozen in time, that cuts off a lot of possibilities.\nSo what do you do? Comic-Book Time. You use the illusion of time passing. You never refer to specific dates if you can help it, and you let characters change, but only a little.\nThis can prove harmful to characters that are tied to a certain time period. For example, since the 1980s, Magneto's backstory and characterisation have been deeply tied to his status as a Holocaust survivor. This causes a particular type of aversion, the Refugee from Time where you just don't allow any Sliding Timescale at all or at least not for one character.\nAnother factor of Comic-Book Time is that it does not pass at the same rate for everyone; secondary characters may catch Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome and age from children to teenagers and then young adults while their adult counterparts remain roughly the same age. Or minor characters can drop out of the narrative, only to return years later, aged, while their counterpart heroes remain youthful. This concept was picked up on in the Fourth Wall-breaking She-Hulk series, in which a Golden Age character decided to hang around She-Hulk as much as possible to stay youthful.\nStories focused around youngsters are especially vulnerable to this, and even aging characters usually aren't allowed to progress to the point they'd be separated from their peers. The aged character's backstory may be tied to a certain event in history and might even make them impossibly old as more time passes.\nOne possible justification is that publication time does not equal the passage of time in the book. Particularly in recent years, comic book publishers have tended to adopt a model where each monthly issue of the book in question is a single installment of a longer story-arc; for instance, a six-issue story arc where Batman takes on the Joker may only equal one night in the actual passage of time. Despite this, the story has taken up half a year of \"real time\". This, naturally, is going to affect both how quickly you can develop the overall narrative and how contemporary you can make it. However, all characters in a universe tend to inhabit the same \"present\", despite when they first appeared or how much time has passed in their series.\nIndeed, this is a valid point, because an open-ended series that wants to keep using the same characters and keep them in a given age-range for a long time pretty much must use some variant of comic-book time.\nAn adaptation of a series that has this can usually avoid it, as most of them only last a few years. On the flipside, non-comic series that last long enough also tend to use this.\nStories that take place in the future, naturally, are allowed to completely ignore this \u2014 unless the same future is referenced again later, in which case it'll have slid forward the same amount.\nWebcomic Time is a similar concept, but instead of the illusion of time passing, time actually does pass over the course of the series, but at a much slower rate than its real-time publication or airing.\nCompare Frozen in Time, Talking Is a Free Action, Not Allowed to Grow Up, Not Growing Up Sucks. Often results in Outdated Outfit. See Year Zero for a compromise, and Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome for similar peculiarities in live-action productions.\n"}
{"StandAloneEpisode": "An episode that can stand alone on its own with a self-contained story that does not need prior viewing of any other episode to understand. It's usually an episode that breaks from the current arc to focus on a one-shot subplot or character; for example, if the arc is about stopping The End of the World as We Know It, a Stand Alone Episode can be about dealing with a Sealed Evil in a Can that's released at the beginning of the episode and resealed by the end of the episode, never to be mentioned again.\nA Stand Alone Episode can also be a Beach Episode, Breather Episode, or A Day in the Limelight, but not always; the only prerequisite of one is not to follow a script that goes on for more than one episode. When such an episode happens to be a Season Finale, it is a D\u00e9nouement Episode.\nMany shows can be considered a long run of Stand Alone Episodes. Comedy series usually consist entirely of Stand-Alones because each episode usually focuses on a different gag or zany schemes. Likewise, Adventure Towns series generally consist of Stand Alone Episodes.\nIn arc-heavy series, a good Stand Alone Episode can be the hook a die-hard fan of the show can use to pull others in, due to its self-contained nature. Likewise, even fans of the arcs will often cite a Stand-Alone as their favorite episode; an arc episode is difficult to separate and appreciate outside of the arc which contains it, but a Stand Alone Episode can be fully appreciated of itself.\nSometimes, though, writers will want to revisit the plot of a Stand Alone Episode and create a later episode that expands on the earlier story; this is a Sequel Episode.\nBy their very nature, the pilot episode for a show is usually a Stand Alone Episode.\nCompare Filler, although the label is usually only used when a stand-alone episode isn't really good enough to stand at all.\n"}
{"CrouchingScholarHiddenBadass": "For this guy, fighting ability is secondary. They're Mission Control, The Face, The Team Benefactor, anything except outright combat, and so they are assumed to be a Non-Action Guy. Then in a special situation, they show how physically mighty they are. After displaying this prowess in combat, goes back to being the unassuming Scholar. Both characters and audiences might forget he's stronger than the Lightning Bruiser because their \"major\" is in something else.\nThe Smart Guy who Minored in Ass-Kicking is a character who, like targets of The Worf Effect, is among the strongest in the cast. The difference is that not only do they rarely get beat up, most anyone challenging them gets their ass handed to them.\nDespite this, they probably aren't an Invincible Hero because they prefer to use their brains and/or diplomacy to solve a problem, and will gladly let the rest of the cast flex their own muscles, only intervening directly when the situation is dire. It's this emphasis on non-combat that saves them from The Worf Barrage, by keeping their combat skills as a hidden depth they pull out maybe every fourth episode.\nDespite their lifesaving combat skills, they may pose a danger to their friends when they aren't fully in control of themselves. When mind controlled they are unbeatable because they are unrestrained. If angered they are unstoppable, and all this usually comes wrapped up in a Nice Guy package. Beware the Nice Ones, indeed.\nCompare Badass Bookworm (for whom this is not an unusual trait), and the more extreme version Genius Bruiser. Contrast Dumbass No More. See also Martial Pacifist. See also Underestimating Badassery if one thinks this guy is all brain and no brawn.\n"}
{"WikiRule": "There is no area of interest, no matter how narrowly defined, where a person cannot put up a wiki for it and attract at least a few editors with similar interests. Increasingly, in fact, there is a chance that someone already has put up a wiki for it. For example, here's one for cacti. The plants.\nIn the early days of the Internet, there was a similar phenomenon, the \"everything has its own home page\" rule. Anyone with enough HTML savvy and a powerful enough interest in one particular subject could and often would create a site dedicated to it. This was largely how the early Web was forged. In fact, all the stuff we know and love today \u2014 e-commerce, social networking \u2014 that came later. Except pornography. Porn was there from the beginning.\nWith the advent of Wikipedia, however, the playing field changed. Rather than rely on a collection of sites each written by one person with questionable expertise, users could now find most of the information they needed in an article written, edited, and fact-checked by an entire userbase of people... with questionable expertise! But all on one easy-to-remember site.\nHowever, a number of factors kept Wikipedia from being a perfect replacement for the old system. A desire for greater detail on the topic than Wikipedia is willing to allow, for one. Schisms or differing schools of thought on the topic was another. Fan-made wikis sprang up to bring back the world of homemade sites with the added benefits of the wiki model.\nThe \"wiki-sphere\" is becoming a vast depository of information at all levels of detail. The encyclopedic wikis are collecting a great breath of topics at an increasingly shallow level of detail, and the topic-intensive wikis are gathering all the details.\nNot all Wikis are on the major search engines, though. Corporations use wikis behind firewalls, the American CIA uses one to collate data among agents and analysts, and even publishers of dead-tree books use them to coordinate edits among authors, editors and copy editors.\nFan-made wikis are usually made on wiki farms, such as FANDOM powered by Wikia.note\u00a0A list of Wikia wikis can be found here, but a warning: It is a 10 mb .txt file(!) and is best downloaded and keyword searched, or else are hosted on a preexisting fansite. Recently, organisations such as NIWA (Nintendo Independent Wiki Alliance) have spoken out against the commercialization that takes place on wiki farms, and have encouraged fans to set up their own websites, while The Anti-Wikia Alliance is against Wikia specifically.\nWikis can reach truly huge sizes. To put them up as candidate for a Doorstopper is an understatement. See the list of largest wikis.\nAlso, due to the ever-increasing importance of wikis in modern internet culture as well as the ever-increasing amount of information stored in said wikis, several archival initiaves such as the Wiki Team by Archive Team (which in and on itself is a wiki) have sprung up in order to protect these valuable codexes of information from maladies such as expired domains and wikifarm shutdowns. Show them some love.\nThe \"dead tree\" equivalent of this trope is The Magazine Rule.\nPlease alphabetize examples by what the wiki is dedicated to rather than by the wiki's name.\n"}
{"ReplayValue": "Describe Replay Value here. Describe Replay Value here. Describe Replay Value here. Describe Replay Value here. Describe Replay Value here. Describe Replay Value here. Describe Replay Value here. Describe Replay Value here. Describe Replay Value here...\nThat one sentence repeated over and over wouldn't make you want to view this page, would it? It's the same with video games - the same thing over and over gets boring after a while. Basically, replay value is how fun a game is after you've beaten it - either by starting a new game or by continuing the game after you've completed the main objective of it. Replay value is one of those things that reviewers (and players) look for in a game, so developers will usually try to squeeze as much replay value into a game as they can.\nThis can be done in several ways:\nFor examples on how not to do it, see Fake Longevity.\nNot to be confused with Replay Value Universe, a recursive elsewhere-roleplay of Homestuck. Also not to be confused with a target score in pinball that (most commonly) awards a free game when reached or exceeded, known as a \"Replay.\"\n"}
{"LayeredWorld": "A setting where our comfy material world is just the tip of an iceberg, the very top layer of many; our puny human senses are simply not trained to perceive the rest of them. With certain magical rituals, you can move down into deeper layers... but there are things down there you might not wanna meet.\nIn a Layered World, several dimensions coexist in space and time. When you move onto deeper layers, you are usually capable of limited perception and interaction with the normal world but never vice versa, though magical sight may allow you to look down a layer or two. Also, each new layer often features slightly different laws of physics: you can gain the ability to walk through material walls, a speed boost, and even new powers, though these usually come at a price. Also, events in one world have an effect on attuned events in the other a la Synchronization or Fisher Kingdom.\nPossible layers include:\nThe rule of thumb to recognize a Layered World is to look for characters saying things like \"This place corresponds to some other place on another layer\".\nSee also Recursive Reality and World Tree.

{"Uninstallment": "An ongoing series skips an installment number (usually deliberately). Events from the missing installment may be referred to as if they had actually happened; there may even be an assurance that it was the highlight of the series.\nReasons for doing this include:\nWhen the non-existent episode is treated by subsequent episodes as if it existed, related to Secondhand Storytelling and perhaps to Noodle Incident.\nA related trick is to bring out a new work that claims to have been made years ago and then shelved or forgotten; we don't seem to have a trope page for that, but Garth Marenghis Darkplace is an example, and it's related to Retraux and Literary Agent Hypothesis.\nWhen there's supposedly an entire series of non-existent episodes preceding the first that actually exists, it's Retroactive Legacy.\nSee also Oddly Named Sequel 2: Electric Boogaloo, where a sequel might be given a strange numbering (such as The Naked Gun 33\u2153 or Halloween H20) without meaning to imply a missing installment; and Unusual Chapter Numbers.

{"GiftOfTheMagiPlot": "A plot reproducing The Gift of the Magi, where two people buy a present for each other \u2014 each gift meant to go with something the other highly values \u2014 and then find that both of them had to sell their respective treasures to pay for the other's gift, making the gifts simultaneously priceless and worthless.\nIn a common variation, the story is given a Lighter and Softer ending in which both characters get back the items they sacrificed. This is likely if they both sold their precious objects to the same person, and even more likely if that person is a mutual friend or relative.\nThis is a Sub-Trope of Whole Plot Reference and a multiple person subtrope of Two Rights Make a Wrong.\nCompare Tragically Misguided Favor, Do They Know It's Christmas Time?, Outhumbling Each Other.

{"HostageSpiritLink": "Curious phenomenon in modern Light Gun games where accidentally shooting innocent people will cause damage to you, either through health and resources, or to overall score.\nThis is used to add difficulty and to prevent the player from spraying bullets everywhere whenever he turns a corner. Naturally, these innocents will be in places where it's easy to get startled and confused and shoot them. If handled poorly, it can often seem that the innocents are simply trying to get shot.\nA form of Videogame Cruelty Punishment. Contrast Friendly Fireproof.\n"}
{"CountryCousin": "Exactly What It Says on the Tin, a cousin who hails from the rural parts of the nation. This trope usually comes into play on shows set in the suburbs or the city, and it usually takes the form of the cousin (or cousins) coming to visit or one of the show's main characters going to the country to visit the cousin. Either way Hilarity Ensues.\nDoesn't necessarily have to be a cousin; it could be any relative. Cousin is just being used as a general term here, since it is somewhat of a common phrase.\nCompare Country Mouse; while that trope usually applies to characters who are naive and central to the cast, this more applies to a character with more or less any personality (though stereotypes applying to the country will usually be apparent) and is at most a Recurring Character.\nSee also The City vs. the Country.\n"}
{"BickeringCouplePeacefulCouple": "In a work which features more than one couple, usually a main pairing and a beta couple, the writers will try to differentiate the two couples from each other. An easy way to do this is to have one couple bicker constantly while the other gets together easily and are sweetly in love. The main couple can be either type, as long as the beta couple are the other type.\nIf The Hero gets together with The Chick, expect their relationship to be the peaceful one.\nNote that while many fictional couples argue a bit before they get together, this trope is about long-term relationships- the bickering couple will always bicker, even after they're together.\nSee Slap-Slap-Kiss, Belligerent Sexual Tension and Everyone Can See It for the bickering couple, and Sickeningly Sweethearts or Happily Married for the peaceful couple. Also related to Beta Couple, Official Couple and Pair the Spares, which may happen to the Beta Couple.\n"}

{"IWantGrandKids": "So, you've grown up and flown the nest. When you look in the mirror, you see a confident, sassy young woman (usually) with a great career, and everything to be proud of.\nWell. Not quite. See, your parents know that the only way you'll truly make them proud is to pop out a few kids of your own, allowing them to live their dream of being grandparents.\nThe reasons for this can differ from parent to parent. Maybe they really do think the only way for their child to be happy is to have children. Maybe they think the only reason you exist is to give them what they want. Maybe they just want some cute kids to dandle on their knee and show photos of them to strangers. Maybe they need someone to carry on the family name. Maybe they want all the joy of children with none of the responsibility of raising them, or maybe they just want to watch you endure all the torture you gave them. If you want to go by evolutionary psychology on this, the entire point of life (as much as life can be said to have a point) is to produce healthy\u2014and fertile\u2014grandkids, as it means that your genes have passed the test of natural selection.\nEither way, you can bet they'll be taking every opportunity to remind their children that their biological clock is ticking, and they should hop to it and make some kids. If the children resist, they can expect to be treated to Not Wanting Kids Is Weird.\nExpect things to be awkward if these parents get introduced to a new love interest, or even an opposite sex friend. You can also expect the occasional mention of how the parents spent the child's entire teen years telling them sex is bad, only to turn a complete 180 at some point and suddenly start telling them to get on with it.\nIf the child is bereaved, this may be one reason why they urge them to seek out a new partner, telling them You Have Waited Long Enough.\nThis can be Truth in Television, but it's so common that there's no need for Real Life examples.\nNote that, despite the above description, this trope is not Always Female. Both male and female examples are straight uses.\nContrast Siblings Wanted, where it's the characters' own children who demand from them to get busy (again) rather than their parents.\n"}
{"LostEpisode": "An episode of a regular series which, for some reason, is not included when the series is shown in syndication (or is sometimes pulled when the series is first run and then shown in syndication or is never shown in syndication at all \u2014 and, in some cases, not included when the show is put on home video, DVD, or online streaming websites). A missing episode is (almost always) an episode that plans to air, but something later comes up to prevent it. The circumstances are usually one, all, or any of the following:\nThe terms \"Missing Episode\" and \"Lost Episode\" are not synonymous, but which term refers to which phenomenon varies. It can also be an abused term, such as the case of Entertainment Tonight finding \"lost footage\" for their shows which is already properly catalogued and digitized, but uses the \"lost\" term instead of \"old footage\" as the latter doesn't work to pull in viewers.\nCan sometimes result from Old Shame. Often overlaps with Keep Circulating the Tapes, which is when a work cannot obtained easily and/or legally (and that's if it can be obtained at all). For an episode that never actually existed in the first place, see UnInstallment. See also Canon Discontinuity, for something that isn't recognized as part of the series, usually due to how out of place it is. See also Banned Episode, which is a Missing Episode that already aired at least once or twice, but was pulled due to complaints over content, legal issues, or a bad case of being \"Too Soon.\" See also Unfinished Episode, which is a Missing Episode that was in the middle of production, but for various reasons was never completed.\nThere is even now an entire wiki devoted to lost media. Check it out for more details behind some of the listed examples here.\n"}
{"GoodInBed": "A character (male or female) possesses In-Universe extraordinary prowess in both scoring and then giving physical sexual pleasure to his/her partner(s). A soft caress on the cheek from such a person can leave the subject a flustered bundle of sexual excitement, a body massage under their hands would be a heavenly experience, while the luckier ones who get to bed this character would most probably be in for the most intensely multi-orgasmic night they've ever had in their lives.\nThe reasons behind said prowess varies. Sometimes it's simply due to knowing \"how to touch them right\", sometimes it's through special sex techniques, sometimes it's by knowing how to make the best out of a larger than average tool, sometimes it's stamina, sometimes it might be actual magic, and sometimes, it's simply being a vampire. The Power Perversion Potential for this ability should be very obvious, assuming that it isn't itself a result of Power Perversion Potential. This an almost mandatory part of a Horny Devil's inventory of abilities. Many pornographic works tend to depict their male characters as this; for live-action ones, this would be an Informed Ability, given that they don't actually do anything \"special\" on-screen.\nNote: This trope is neither tied to a specific gender nor tied to a specific sexual orientation. Also, being able to do one or two \"tricks\" to get one's partner to hit the O-zone does not qualify for this trope. The character is supposed to be (hailed as) a veritable expert in carnal delights, not a \"one-trick pony\".\nMay serve as a justification for the attractiveness behind the Chick Magnet/Hello, Nurse!, the Pornomancer, or the Kavorka Man.\nNot to be confused with an actual deity of sexual activity, though due to their particular domain, they often are Sex Gods by necessity.\nCompare with The Casanova, who has high prowess/skill in seduction rather than sexual pleasure; of course, being a consistently successful Casanova would usually require being a Sex God, too.\n"}
{"LightTheWay": "Want to show how good and just your hero is? Want to show the elemental forces of evil exactly why they need to Beware the Nice Ones? Then just use this counterpart to Casting a Shadow: Light! This frequently involves healing and divine powers, although this can mean literal light as well. This may overlap with Holy Hand Grenade if the powers in question are used to attack. Like most other types of elemental manipulation, the laws of physics give way to Rule of Cool. Users of light powers may be able to project Hard Light or fire Frickin' Laser Beams.\nLight has many similarities to fire, producing both illumination and heat. Thematically, however, fire is often presented as a primal or destructive force, whereas light is a protective force that literally illuminates the darkness. In some cases, light and fire overlap and sometimes intersects with electricity as well. All three of these powers may also possess qualities of purification or total destruction, depending on the work in question. See also The Power of the Sun, as, in fiction, a solar power is occasionally a mixture of the powers of fire and light.\nThe Hero is likely to use this, and if so, is likely to be a saint. The hero is likely to learn this from the Big Good or the The Mentor, who will be the master of this. Alternately, a work may instead use Light Is Not Good, in which case, this may be used by the villain. In that case, similar to how The Sacred Darkness illustrates a way to portray Casting a Shadow in a pure and holy fashion, a villanous or \"corrupt\" form of light may involve such lovely things as light so bright that it burns out the victim's eyes, causes his flesh to be brutally melted off, or making his light come with other harmful radiations etc.\nA Sub-Trope of Elemental Powers. Usually trumps darkness, though the reverse is also possible. Or both, even. For double the fun, see Yin-Yang Bomb.\nThis trope is Light purely acting as its own element.\nA Sister Trope to Holy Hand Grenade and Holy Is Not Safe (also overlaps with Light attacks when fueled by good).\nContrast with Power of the Void, Casting a Shadow.

{"ExposedEyeballsAsEyes": "Most normal eyes are visibly connected to their user's body in some way, whether it be by the standard optic nerve and them sitting comfortably behind a pair of eyelids, or, say, them being placed on a stalk if you're some sort of alien, crab, or snail. Not in this case; this trope is about characters whose eyes are literally exposed eyeballs that aren't visibly connected to anything, and at best are just slapped on top of their head (somehow without falling off or rolling away).\nMay either be a specific case of Cartoony Eyes, or a trait of a particularly monstrous or weird being. May involve Eyes Do Not Belong There. Not to be confused with Faceless Eye, which is about a single eyeball devoid of a body or face. Compare Disembodied Eyebrows.\n"}
{"ExceptionallyTolerant": "In real life, people who are strange or eccentric tend to be treated badly, avoided, or even bullied. Sadly, the same often happens to various minorities. As fiction tries its best to reflect reality, that's often the case in TV Land, or books. Sometimes, such works will have one or several characters who are accepting of the minority or odd, eccentric individual, but prejudice will be shown by others.\nBut sometimes, the character lives in an unusual land where literally everyone is totally accepting, where discrimination is minimal, or even nonexistent, as if it never occurred in that reality or it has been permanently dealt with. Not only that, but the only way discrimination would exist is if it's literally fictional \u2014 as in, the characters can only see racism and other forms of bigotry in fictional media (watching it on TV, reading comic books and stories, etc.), but never non-fictional media and never in their real world. If that's the case, the other characters are exceptionally tolerant. This is on the idealistic side of the Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism.\nSometimes, this is done in comedies so that a silly or odd character can be accepted into society while providing laughs through their odd interactions with others. Sometimes, this is done in more serious stories because the story hinges on someone being accepted who in real life might not be readily accepted into society, and some amount of unrealism is necessary in order to make the story work.\nOther times, it's done because the author wants to avoid the real-life drama and sadness that accompanies actual bullying and ostracizing, while still allowing an unusual character or real-life unpopular minority to take part in the story. Similarly, in historical-themed stories, it's done to avoid exposing viewers/readers to Values Dissonance. For more examples of that in particular, see Politically Correct History.\n"}
{"RecurringTraveler": "A character who keeps turning up in a video game.\nIn mild cases, this is just a travelling salesman or NPC who shows up with no logical regard to how they could be there. In dramatic cases, this is obviously an important character who plays the idiot as a disguise, so you aren't suspicious of them following you.\nThis is different than the Goldfish Poop Gang, since you generally don't fight them along the way. Also different is Inexplicably Identical Individuals, where it's not the same traveller but a set of distant relatives with an uncanny family resemblance. The Recurring Extra is a Recurring Traveller who doesn't do anything. They might also be a merchant constantly trying to extort money from you, even if the failure of your main character means the end of the world.\nSometimes in an RPG, The Recurring Traveller is a character who always happens to be staying in a bedroom of the same inn that your party is staying at. He may comment about being a tourist or sight-seer. He may give tips about the local environment, monsters, hazards and landmarks.\nThe Recurring Traveller is frequently used as a device to help the player when they're in a difficult area. If you run short of supplies after fighting your way through an especially dangerous area, the Recurring Traveller just happens to be someone who can either heal your party or let you replenish your inventory.\nAction-Adventure\nAdventure Game\nEastern RPG\nFirst-Person Shooter\nPlatform Game\nReal-Time Strategy\nSports Game\nSurvival Horror\nTurn-Based Strategy\nWestern RPG\n"}
{"ArtifactOfPower": "You know, these people with their superpowers and magic are really annoying. They can summon fire up from nowhere, be in two places at once, even give other people abilities! Why can't I do that?\nWhat you need is an Artifact of Power. Each is an item, tool or device capable of astonishing feats, typically (though not always) independently from any supernatural abilities of their wielder (though they don't necessarily need one), that outstrip anything else that their world can offer. Unlike some types of phlebotinum, Artifacts of Power are not naturally occurring: they are constructed. (The word \"artifact\" literally means \"something made by humans,\" and contains the same root as \"artificial.\") They can range from the simplest Magic Staff to the most complex construct and don't even have to be magical either, though what else can anything on that power level be?\nTo be precise, the thing that separates Artifacts of Power from regular tools is rarity. Modern explosives might do a far better job than a Wand of Fireballs in causing explosion-based havoc; explosives, however, are (relatively) easy to manufacture today, whereas fireball-shooting wands in many settings won't be. If they are, then, though powerful, they in turn aren't artifacts; the Legendary Wand of Angkor Wat, on the other hand, will be one. As a result, Artifacts of Power are frequently either one-of-a-kind, the methods of crafting it lost to the mists of time; made of a substance that is difficult to find; or incredibly, incredibly hard to produce. This rarity, in combination with its might and utility, will often make an Artifact of Power an object of desire for a great many individuals and organisations, both savoury and unsavoury, meaning that a MacGuffin has a good chance of being one.\nSubtrope of Phlebotinum.

{"TokenNonHuman": "When a work has an ordinary setting, your cast is going to be... well, ordinary. Your basic Five-Man Band, maybe with a Token Minority, or a Token Girl.\nBut when you're the author of Speculative Fiction, authors can make the cast as interesting as they want. Enter the Token Nonhuman to spice things up. He (or she; this is a Unisex Trope) could be a Rubber-Forehead Alien, a Robot Buddy, a Funny Animal, a Civilized Animal, a Partially Civilized Animal, or all of the above at once, but one thing is for sure. They aren't human.\nEven Demi Humans like elves can count as examples of this trope.\nA Token Nonhuman is not the Team Pet \u2014 the team pet is, well, a pet that belongs to the team, but the Token Nonhuman is a sapient being who stands on more-or-less equal footing with the humans.\nUnlike other token what-have-yous, a token nonhuman is not there to attract a Periphery Demographic. Probably. A Token Nonhuman instead serves the purpose of exploring the possibility of other species with radically different natures from our own, incorporating beings with cool superhuman abilities, showing that the main cast is not practicing Fantastic Racism, and exploring the question What Measure Is A Nonhuman. If nothing else, the Token Non-Human can serve as the Amusing Alien for comic relief.\nBecause Most Writers Are Human (to our knowledge), you'll likely not see more than one Main Character who isn't human, hence the \"token\" part of \"Token Nonhuman\". If there is more than one nonhuman character, you'll most likely see a cast full of nonhumans, with a Token Human.\nToken Heroic Orc is this trope meeting Token Enemy Minority.

This is commonly cited by the Moral Guardians as evidence that Reality TV is pure trash (\"We're eating worms for money!\" a character complained in Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip). Occasionally survival-type shows will attempt to vaguely justify it as the equivalent of searching for food and getting whatever is necessary, but in those cases contestants might be doing that anyway and never need to resort to eating or even find anything as gross as what the show forces them to eat. Another common justification is that the food is actually Foreign Queasine; something that the locals do, in fact, eat (although not usually in anywhere near the same quantities as the contestants have to.)\nContrast Reduced to Ratburgers, in which it's typically the eater's survival rather than bank account that's at stake.

{"RapeIsaSpecialKindofEvil": "In many works of fiction, especially situations of Rape as Drama, rape is not merely bad; it's a qualitatively different level of evil. As such, a rape scene can be used as a Kick the Dog moment for a particularly evil character, or as the point where a character who previously was merely unlikeable crosses the Moral Event Horizon into monster territory.\nNote that not only is rape considered a game changer for almost all characters, but it is also so for the writer. Many stories and Crapsack Worlds have monsters who don't commit rape, even though everything about their character indicates they could, would, or should. There are also times when rape is kept \"off camera\" or otherwise something in the past, or hinted at once and never brought up again.

However, it is never a case of a Secret Legacy; the king always knows that he is the king, and is generally plotting for when the Rightful King Returns, or has been using a Decoy Leader to rule. If he doesn't know he is the king/emperor/etc. then the situation is I Am Who?\nIt can lead to a Right in Front of Me moment. God Was My Copilot and Angel Unaware are the supernatural versions of this trope.\nVery common for Royals Who Actually Do Something as it allows the king to leave the stuffy confines of his castle and interact with the people outside without drawing too much potentially dangerous attention to themselves. If this character isn't good at passing for common, he may be Rich in Dollars, Poor in Sense.\nCompare Body Double, Modest Royalty, Secretly Wealthy. Compare also Hidden Backup Prince, who is likewise hidden, but often without knowledge of their Secret Legacy. Contrast with Ermine Cape Effect and Mock Millionaire. Sub-Trope of Secret Identity.\n"}
{"OurTitansAreDifferent": "In Classical Mythology, the Titans (and their Primordial parents before them) were ancient godly beings that had ruled reality, until they were overthrown by the Olympians in the Titanomachy.note\u00a0The Titans were originally considered true gods. Later Classical writers started confusing them with Giants, but this was not the usual representation. Also, the name Titan sometimes only refers to the first generation, though usually the non-nymph, non-Olympian children of Titans are also called Titans. Titans and primordials have since been featured in many works of fiction, and have several common traits among their varying depictions.\nThese include:\nCompare Our Giants Are Bigger, Our Gods Are Different, and The Old Gods. For the moon by that name, see The Moons of Saturn.\nIs not related to different versions of the Teen Titans.\n"}
{"StandardSciFiSetting": "\"In the far future, the [human group] fights a pitched battle against the mighty [alien name] Empire, but deep in the mysterious [region of space], among the ruins of the past, a darker threat looms.\"\nDoes the above sentence sound familiar? It should. It's probably the single most popular Space Opera premise around. In fact, you could even call it the Standard Sci-Fi Setting. Typical features of the Standard setting include:\nTechnology:\nPopulation:\nFactions:\nA typical plot involves the humans fighting the Proud Warrior Race Guys until one or the other stumbles upon the ruins of the Neglectful Precursor civilization and unleashes the evil third race. Then a bunch of people die, there are lots of cool explosions, and the first two races team up to take out the genocidal aliens. Usually they have to track down some Lost Superweapon and use it to destroy the alien queen/mothership/homeworld, thereby saving the galaxy... for now.\nNot surprisingly, this setting tends to fall toward the \"soft\" end of the Mohs Scale of Sci-Fi Hardness. Examples come mostly from TV, Movies, and especially video games, where scientific accuracy often takes a back seat to awesome visuals and an engaging storyline. Compare Sci-Fi Kitchen Sink, which takes a Standard Sci-Fi Setting, then crams as many other Speculative Fiction Tropes into it as it can.\n"}
{"GreenLantern": "The Emerald Knights. The Ring-Slingers. The Cosmic Cops. The Quintessential Space Police.Outer space isn't as dark as you think.Green Lantern is a classic DC Comics Super Hero and one of the first to embrace the concept of a Legacy Character. Green Lantern has the unique ability to create objects out of solid green light, whose forms are limited only by the character's imagination. In addition, he can fire energy blasts, fly in deep space, generate force fields, and translate (almost) any alien language. All this is provided by a quasi-technological Power Ring, that must be recharged every 24 hours with a lantern-esque Power Battery. Oh, and it can't work on the color yellow (usually).Created in 1940, the original Green Lantern was a railroad engineer named Alan Scott. The train he was traveling in wrecked when the bridge it was on collapsed due to sabotage. Alan was the only one who survived the wreck, thanks to the green lantern he was holding at the time. He fashioned his ring from a part of the lantern, which unknown to him at the time was constructed out of a magic metal made from a meteor that fell to Earth, later retconned into the Starheart.Alan used his fists as often as he used his ring, and was more of a pulp hero than a sci-fi one. Along the way he picked up comic sidekick Doiby Dickles who accompanied him on his adventures, and he became one of the founding members of the Justice Society of America. Like most of the other DC characters of the time, he had adventures against regular criminals as well as super powered adversaries, and then his comic ended as super-heroes fell out of fashion in the late 40s. Alan was one of the mainstays of the All-American anthology series, as well as his own Green Lantern title. His solo series was cancelled in 1949, and his last Golden Age appearance was in issue 57 of All-Star comics in 1951.However, in 1959, after the successful reinvention of the Flash, DC Comics revamped the title with a sci-fi bent, reimagining the hero as test pilot turned space cop Hal Jordan, who was given a Power Ring by a dying alien who crash landed on Earth (and was just one of many extraterrestrial peacekeepers serving the wise Guardians of the Universe). What most people know of the character originated during this era: the villainous Lantern renegade Sinestro, the living planet Mogo, alien drill instructor Kilowog, (though those last two only came into the picture in the 80's),and aerospace entrepreneur/love interest Carol Ferris. Other characters were brought in as Green Lantern during this time. Lovable jerk Guy Gardner first appeared, was Put on a Bus, then came back full time during the Crisis. Stoic architect and former U.S. Marine John Stewart became a backup Green Lantern during the well-known \"relevant\" Green Lantern/Green Arrow issues, and then the main Green Lantern in the 1980s when Hal Jordan gave up the title. Alan Scott would also return, first as an Earth-2 counterpart to Hal, then after continuities got merged in the Crisis on Infinite Earths as a respected elder hero with only the loosest connection to the Corps.Over the years, the Green Lantern title would gain infamy for being taken in a few controversial directions:The Green Lanterns are also frequent members of versions of the Justice League of America, with Hal, John, Kyle and Jade part of different incarnations of the main team, Guy in the Justice League International, and Simon in a secondary JLA team. Alan Scott is also a founding member of the Justice Society of America, which is either the League's predecessor or its Earth-2 counterpart depending on the era, as well his daughter Jade, who was part of the Earth-2 counterpart of Teen Titans, Infinity, Inc., and one the formations of the Outsiders. Also see The New Guardians (not related to the current title), which was tangentially related to the Lantern franchise (founded by the Guardians and including Hal's friend Tom as a member).Outside of comics, associated Green Lanterns has appeared a number of times:With a Corps of over 7,000 alien enforcers, you better believe there's a Character Sheet. And if you're still confused about why there's so many Lanterns or how willpower tastes like green, feel free to read the Synopsis.Western Animation"}
{"PhysicalGods": "One step below being one of the Powers That Be. Occasionally shares space with The Great Gazoo. They usually start out as a Power That Is but gradually the plot drives them downward.\nMythology often depicted gods as \"human, but bigger.\" Similar emotions, virtues, vices, etc. but with more power. Special effects and global story-telling exposure has expanded the concept. Gods are often humanoid (easier for actors to portray them) and have a number of powers. The difference between them and non-divine characters is they don't have to be \"balanced\" in terms of other characters.\nTypical god powers and traits can include:\nInterestingly, Superman and some of the more powerful Flying Bricks fulfill most of these requirements, except possibly the worship bit. This depends on how strictly you define worship, of course, since subscribing isn't usually considered the same as tithing. (For rabid fans, subscriptions can total a lot more than 10% of your income!). Then again, Superman does share a setting with actual Physical Gods, most of whom are even stronger still than he is (Depending on the Writer, of course).\nIn other fiction, characters who may not strictly be gods may get powers like these simply because, in a place where Everyone is a Super, then the only way you can really mount a truly serious threat to a world with millions of super-powered civilians is to give the baddies even more absurdly powerful abilities.\nSometimes, a human can become a Physical God, especially if it's possible for said gods to die. These newly minted gods may choose to take up the mantle with solemnity, cackle madly that \"A God Am I!\", or steadfastly say \"A God I Am Not\" from lingering sympathy to their human origins.\nThe existence of a Physical God presents a superficial difficulty to a Flat-Earth Atheist; however, the problem can be overcome by distinguishing a Physical God from whatever Powers That Be might or might not exist in the universe (considering the former to be \"merely\" ultra-powerful beings not different in principle from anybody else who happens to have similar levels of power, and applying the label \"god\" only to the latter. The non-trivial difficulty in determining the difference when such beings can only be viewed from a limited human scale is often brushed under the rug). Smarter Flat Earth Atheists will turn into Nay Theists instead...or welcome the new divine overlord....\nCompare Reality Warper, Eldritch Abomination, Anthropomorphic Personification, Abstract Apotheosis, Deity of Human Origin, Ultimate Life Form, and Sufficiently Advanced Alien. See also Our Gods Are Different for a more general trope, and Humans Are Cthulhu, for when Puny Earthlings are seen as this by other creatures. They're usually the center of a Physical Religion.

{"NonindicativeTitle": "Sometimes, a title makes no sense. Sometimes, however, a title will make a sort of sense, but on later ponderings, will be seen as misleading. Sometimes this is due to the title being an Artifact Title or perhaps the writer simply thought it was a cooler name. Also sometimes leads to instances of I Am Not Shazam.\nCompare Completely Different Title when it changes the original title to a misleading one. Contrast Exactly What It Says on the Tin. By definition, all examples of \"Untitled\" Title have inaccurate titles. See also Deceptively Silly Title, Sarcastic Title, Trivial Title, and Secondary Character Title. Subverted by Spoiler Title, which is so accurate that it manages to give away important plot points. Inaccurate or misleading titles are an essential part of a Clickbait Gag, which mocks online uses of this trope among other manipulative online tropes.\n"}
{"MaximumHPReduction": "Characters in Video Games and Tabletop Games suffer ridiculous amounts of bodily harm, but unless their Hit Points reach zero, they usually remain fully functional and can be restored back to perfect health within seconds by consuming a Healing Potion or using some healing magic.\nThis trope is about games that additionally feature enemies whose attacks can deal permanent damage, reducing the target's maximum number of HP, so that even if they can heal, it's in their best interests to avoid getting hit and end the fights quickly. Often, such \"permanent\" damage can be healed later but in a much more costly/time consuming way. Hence, such an attack can easily become That One Attack.\nIn any system where you have Body Armor as Hit Points, a move that steals or destroys the armor in question will invariably reduce the target's maximum HP. In some game systems, a Level Drain has this effect due to maximum HP being derived from experience level.\nCompare Healing Magic Is the Hardest, where even magical healing is scarcely available. Wound That Will Not Heal is a more general narrative trope.\n"}
{"LogicalLatecomer": "Being new to a group or setting helps the latecomer notice that everyone else isn't operating with a full deck.\nBeing the Sixth Ranger, Na\u00efve Newcomer, or rookie member means that you're likely absent from all the mental leaps and decisions that your predecessors all took. Because of that, none of them can Spot the Thread or notice that there's something incredibly wrong about the whole picture.\nSee also We Have Become Complacent. Compare Is It Always Like This? and its response Welcome to My World. This may lead to the newcomer being a Defector from Decadence if they leave the group, or the Only Sane Man if they stay.\nSuch a character may also become an Audience Surrogate, especially in later installments, to alleviate Continuity Lockout. Compare and contrast Na\u00efve Newcomer.\n"}
{"MyRulesAreNotYourRules": "Games have rules. These rules aren't always fair: The average First-Person Shooter pits a single player against multiple groups of enemies, all of whom are trying to kill him.\nSome games, however, supposedly apply the same rules to the human and AI players. The red bike has a max speed of 230 kph, batteries for 500 laser shots, can't take corners well... wait a minute! The blue bike has a max speed of 190 kph, so how did it overtake your red bike when it was going at max speed?\nThis is one of the most egregious forms of The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard, in which the AI players break the explicitly laid-out rules of the game. This throws any idea of equality out the window. However, since many games would be rather dull if the AI played fair, some believe this to be a necessary evil. Others, meanwhile, will take great, detailed pains to elaborate to their associates what horrors they would adore visiting upon the game programmers.\nSometimes this is actually inverted for the player's benefit to provide a fair challenge - in games which value input speed and assume equal footing of both sides (such as fighting games), the AI simulating the opponent has to naturally be handicapped so that the player has a fighting chance, considering the computer has no need to physically bash buttons, is capable of perfect timing, knows every move and would never fumble a special attack unless some kind of restriction is in place. In games like Real-Time Strategy, this generally ensures the computer opponent won't try cheap or underhanded tactics (such as foregoing base building, investing everything in a Zerg Rush of starter units to win quickly).\nSometimes this doesn't come out of a desire to give the AI an advantage, but because it would be too difficult or even impossible to program the AI to handle something in the \"proper\" way. Other times, it's just an oversight or an outright bug.\nNote that this applies only to games and situations where the human and the AI are supposed to be on an equal footing. If the rules say the AI is in a different situation to the human, treating them differently isn't cheating.\nCompare Rules Are For Humans, which applies to adaptations of existing games. Contrast Player-Exclusive Mechanic, where the player can do things the AI cannot.\n Non-Video Game Examples\n"}
{"ExpositoryThemeSong": "A Theme Tune which explains, fairly specifically, the premise of the show. An Opening Narration in verse. It might also throw in an Introdump for the central characters during the middle 10 seconds.\nThis was fairly standard for the early sitcom. Later sitcoms moved away from this form in favor of the Thematic Theme Tune, and then toward the Surreal Theme Tune. Today, the Expository Theme Tune is limited mostly to children's programs. Gilligan's Island, the most famous, used it specifically due to Executive Meddling, so that people who tuned in after the pilot wouldn't get lost. Many kids' shows that use it don't even have a pilot, or air episodes out of order. (Animaniacs and Freakazoid! are the big examples.)\nSome shows might use the Expository Theme Tune as an excuse to dump you into the action right away, since you already know the premise. Conversely, if the Expository Theme Tune would spoil the premise of the premiere, you might not see it on the first episode.\nThis style of Theme Tune is also the most common for a Show Within a Show, and is practically universal when the fictional show is meant to be mocked.\nA common Subtrope is the Bragging Theme Tune and Theme Tune Roll Call.\nCompare with the Anime Theme Song and the Theme Tune Rap.\n"}
{"VideoGamePerversityPotential": "As soon as any editing tools are created for a video game, players will make either pornographic, profane, or phallic content.\nThis tends to take three forms:\nBack in the bad old days of video games, almost any one who could code up a video game that could run on the Atari 2600 or the TI-80 did, and this led to a great deal of Shovelware titles - and yes, Rule 34 applied in spades. The Angry Video Game Nerd did an entire episode dedicated to 8-bit versions of this trope. Definitely Not Safe for Work (or sanity).\nThis is a video game subtrope of Rule 34, cousin of Video Game Cruelty Potential. Compare Power Perversion Potential, Third-Person Seductress, The Rule of First Adopters. Can be used as a form of Poor Man's Porn. May lead to staff nixing player-created content if abused in online settings, especially if the game is meant to be family-friendly.\n"}
{"Worldbuilding": "Worldbuilding is the process of constructing a fictional universe. Strictly speaking, anything that happens in that universe \"builds\" it, so \"worldbuilding\" is only used to describe the invention of fictional details for some reason other than the convenience of a currently ongoing story, up to and including simply engaging in worldbuilding for its own sake.\nA common form of worldbuilding is the creation of history. This could just be a Framing Device for a story told by a historian, but fantasy worlds regularly include historical notes for centuries of warfare and intrigue. Stories can then be written at various points along that timeline, and each of those stories will have a clear relationship to all the others. It makes the writing of serial fiction much easier, especially if the series has multiple authors. If so, the fictional universe is a Shared Universe.\nThe result may sometimes be called a Constructed World, conworld or (Tolkien's word) sub-creation. The term world-building was popularized at science fiction writers' workshops during the 1970s. It connotes a focus on detail and consistency. Many post-The Lord of the Rings Fantasy and post-Dune Science Fiction writers use world-building in an attempt to give their stories weight and meaning that they would not have without a well-defined setting.\nConstructed worlds frequently have their own aesthetics, above and beyond the aesthetics of the stories taking place in those worlds. Some artists and hobbyists build fictional worlds with no intention of writing any stories in them\u2014at least, none more detailed than historical documents.\n Worldbuilding has two separate meanings:\nExtra worldbuilding that is only referred to obliquely is a Cryptic Background Reference. Over the course of a long running series or large persistent universe such as an MMORPG, these add up to form what is sometimes known as the \"invisible book\"- the portion of a story which becomes known over time without ever actually being directly described.\nSee also Adventure-Friendly World, a common constraint on Worldbuilding, and The Trope History of the Universe\nTV Tropes has a World Creation Project.\n"}
{"TitleOnlyChorus": "A music trope. A song whose chorus consists entirely of the song title, repeated over and over again, perhaps with slight variation. Particularly common in modern pop music, this can be good marketing, as the listener will tend to notice and remember the song title. It's hard to pull off depending on the song structure and the syllables. However, it has a higher potential of becoming an Audience Participation Song. Easier to do with a Long Title.\nCompare Title Theme Tune and Chorus-Only Song.\n"}
{"SlidingScaleOfLinearityVsOpenness": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Video Games are linear, forcing you to follow one set path throughout the whole game. Other games are more open, allowing you to choose how you progress to your goal. Some games are are even more open than that, giving you a wide open world to explore at your leisure. Most Action/Adventure/Action-Adventure/Platform games fall somewhere in this spectrum of linearity and openness; this scale exists to catalog exactly where they fall.\nThe Sliding Scale of Linearity vs. Openness comprises six categories for ranking how linear or open a game is. The lower on the scale a game is, the more No Sidepaths, No Exploration, No Freedom it is; the higher on the scale a game is, the more Wide Open Sandbox it is. Platform Games will usually rank low on the scale (by design), while Role Playing Games will usually rank high on the scale (by convention).\nThe most important factor in determining where a game lies on this scale is the game world itself. A game that limits you to one path will rank lower on the scale than a game that presents an open world and lets you decide how you are going to get to your objective. The objectives themselves are also important in determining a game's place on the scale. A game with a set story progression and one goal or a linear series of goals that get you from the beginning to the end will rank lower than a game with many Side Quests or a game with multiple ways to progress through the main story. A game can still rank relatively high on the scale with few side quests if it presents you with many missions that are required to complete the main story line and lets you decide how/in what order you will accomplish them. The way the story is set up, however, will usually be influenced by how linear or open the game is, not the other way around.\nSee also the Sliding Scale of Content Density vs. Width. Although there is a noticeable correlation between the openness of the game world (linearity of exploration) and the degree of Story Branching in a game (linearity of plot), these are two separate scales.\n"}
{"TrueStoryInMyUniverse": "This is where the events of a work are made into a film or book that is considered Based on a True Story, or similar, within the story itself (but not outside it). This often comes with Legendary in the Sequel.\nNote: This is In-Universe only.\nNot to be confused with Direct Line to the Author and Recursive Canon.\n"}
{"ImportantCharacterImportantEvidence": "In mystery fiction (not necessarily crime fiction), the important evidence is found by important characters. It doesn't matter how many people are searching, how inexperienced the main character is at mystery solving, or if they are operating out of their field.\nThey could be off the case, sent home sick, having a day off, late for work, etc. Someone will throw the evidence out the window of a moving car for it to hit them in the face. No matter what, main characters find the evidence.\nThis trope is understandably found everywhere in mystery fiction, since main characters are meant to drive the plot, yet most authors do not attempt to explain the continuing good fortune of sleuths, both amateur and professional, finding that one piece of evidence that not only seals the mystery up in a neat little package, but also managed to elude everyone else.\nOf course, maybe they wouldn't be main characters if this sort of thing didn't happen to them.\nA sub-trope of The Main Characters Do Everything. Related to Busman's Holiday.\n"}
{"TasteOfPower": "When starting a video game, a player sometimes starts out with an extremely powerful party, character, weapon or ability, which can easily slaughter anything it comes across. The player is in no real danger of losing and often can't lose even if they tried. But, this incredible power never lasts long. Once the introductory segment is complete, the player switches to the real party, usually at level 1 with basic starter gear and/or stripped of all those cool powers.\nThe primary purpose of this trope is to get a player into a game and teach them the rules without overwhelming them with dangerous enemies early on. This can also give them a preview of the powers and skills they'll be acquiring later in the game. Common marketing wisdom is that you have to sell your game on the players in the first ten minutes, or you risk them not sticking around to get to the really good parts - hence A Taste Of Power to draw a player in.\nAnother advantage to A Taste of Power is that the player gets to do something and have some fun while the scene is set and the story established, instead of sitting through a non-interactive opening cutscene or simply wandering around the First Town talking to people and trying to figure out what to do.\nFrequently used in RTS games to allow the player to be given a tutorial of all the game elements in one sitting.\nThis is sometimes done by means of a Crutch Character, who leaves, is killed, or is depowered after the segment is over, weakening your fighting strength. It frequently ends with a Warmup Boss.\nIf some programming oversight allows you to retain some of this power, such as by removing the ridiculously powerful equipment from a temporary character, the result may make the game incredibly easy.\nAlso known as \"Abilitease\" on the Giant Bomb wiki.\nIn other media such as film and literature, the Taste Of Power is often used to show the future potential of a protagonist, or to justify a character's extreme future efforts in developing themselves. As a typical example, a character may have A Taste Of Power when first using magic in order that they will know magic exists and they have any talents necessary to perform it at the highest level, this justifying the character going on to spend months or years studying it and leaving the reader trusting that the results will be spectacular.\nCompare Bag of Spilling, where a player character's hard-won power is somehow lost between the end of one game and the beginning of its sequel. If you wind up having to fight the Crutch Character later, you've been walking in Villain Shoes. May coincide with And Now for Someone Completely Different. The inversion is 11th-Hour Superpower, where you get special abilities at the end of the game. Also contrast Second Hour Superpower, where the player character starts generically and gets his/her defining ability only partway through. May be Purposely Overpowered.\n"}

{"HighSchoolIsHell": "There's something about secondary education \u2014 the nature of teenagers, the nature of the adults that work with teenagers, parents' expectations that things will be just like when they were a kid \u2014 that lends itself to the accrual of strange national customs. Every major country has its own, but as far as 90% of the entries on this wiki are concerned, only three countries' systems actually count \u2014 the US, the UKnote\u00a0 It should be worth mentioning that England and Scotland have different systems, rendering 'British' confusing for actual Brits. and Japan. (Sorry, Germany.) The Canadian system (at least the Anglophone one) is basically similar to the US, the Irish system broadly similar to the British one (though it starts a year later than the British do), and the (South) Korean one similar to Japan (sorry, Canada, Ireland, and Korea.) This entry is primarily about the American one.\nIn the US, high school is usually the last four years of compulsory education (grades 9-12), although in some districts it's the last three (grades 10-12). In Japan it's three years (equivalent to grades 10-12), and not compulsory. In both cases students are likely to be coming from a Junior High, which consists of grades 7-9 (although not all US districts have those). In the American South and other regions of the U.S. grades 6-8 are called middle school, and elementary school ends at grade 5 rather than at 6, as it does when the school district is zoned for junior highs instead of middle schools. In Russia, it's called \"middle\" school, \"high\" being the university, and lasts through grades five to eleven, being kind of conjoined with Junior High. For Britain, see The Good Old British Comp.\nHigh schools in television tend to be cleaner, more modern, better lit, more architecturally interesting and have better food than most of their real-world counterparts. Obviously, there do exist real-world high schools which are large, spacious, space-inefficient, and brand spanking new, but as public school buildings tend to have very long operational lifetimes, these are in the minority.\nThe archetypical high school set consists of a single hallway lined with wide lockers, and three doorways leading to a classroom, the principal's office, and a rest room. An interesting note is that in Real Life, many high schools in the southern and western parts of the US are \"open-air\" \u2014 meaning, classroom doors open to the outside, and there are no hallways at all. It's egregious with the many high school-centric television shows set in California, a state which has almost exclusively open-air campuses. It should be noted that the big gothic-looking schools of film were designed for maximum heat in winter. In the Mediterranean climate where this is less of an issue, open air schools were built to keep classrooms cool, but once air conditioning became universal in schools in the 2000s, the trend went back towards one large building.\nTelevision high school students spend an inordinate amount of time in a single classroom, which is not unreasonable given the likelihood that we will only ever see one or two teachers. Any student we care about will have his or her locker in the hallway immediately outside the only classroom. The former is actually Truth in Television in Japan and a few other countries where students are assigned to a class that stays in a set homeroom with teachers coming in and out depending on the subject.\nIf we see another classroom, 99% of the time it will be a thoroughly well-stocked science lab, often with trappings more appropriate to 30 years ago (or whenever the producers went to high school).\nRest rooms are always accessible to students, and it is not uncommon or difficult for one to spend time in the rest room of the opposite gender in order to hold a private conference.\nTelevision writers seem unable to keep clear which conventions are specific to a high school, and which are more appropriate to a college (see also Elaborate University High). There are often times during the school day when a student may freely wander the building without having to be anywhere in particular, and can freely enter and leave the campus at any time. It is also common for a single class to be canceled, giving a student character some free time. All of these things may exist in some actual US high schools, but it is far and away more common for students to be required to remain in their classrooms unless given written permission to use the restroom or go somewhere else, and many schools even employ guards to stop students from wandering the halls or leaving the campus.\nYou will notice that the writers often base high school themed works off of where they went to high school, or off of popular stereotypes that are present in a lot of high schools. Part of the reason Alpha Bitch, Book Worm, and Jerk Jock tropes are so prevalent in these works is because everybody knew someone like that. (Detailed below) It's often heavily exaggerated, too, for Rule of Funny and Rule of Drama. As a result of how different all schools are from one another, there's going to be somebody in the audience saying \"Have these guys ever actually been to high school?!\"\nIn fiction, school sports are often a strictly male domain. Women's sports teams will essentially be non-existent, with women relegated strictly to cheerleader or non-athletic extracurricular activities.\nFictional American high schools are almost always named after historical presidents of the United States, with the more obscure 19th-century presidents (Fillmore, Polk, McKinley...) most favored though other famous historical figures may be used as well. Hillariously obscure or inappropriate figures (such as George Wallace or Dan Quayle) may be chosen for comedic effect. A high school named for the community where it is located (Sunnydale High) is often used to invoke a small-town or suburban setting and geographic names like Moperville North and Moperville South usually indicate that a cross-town rivalry is going to figure into the plot. These are the most common sources of names for US high schools in the real world as well.\nClass-times may vary to suit the needs of the plot, with the result that students may arrive to or depart from the same class to a destination which differs from episode to episode.\nBells often do not work the same way as real life high schools. In fiction, students will often be seen chatting in the hall while a bell rings and don't seem to have any hurry to go anywhere once the bell does ring. In many real high schools, students are expected to be in the classroom before the bell rings and nobody should be in the hallway at that time.\nSchools have mascots. As in real-life, they appear to have been chosen entirely at random. As in real-life, they are often patently ridiculous. Often, an \"uncool\" male protagonist will take a turn in the school mascot costume, for one episode, but almost never takes over the role for an entire season.\nHigh schools seen in anime tend to be far more detailed than their American counterparts when they play any part in a story, but this may be attributed to the fact that there are only two or three basic school designs permitted by the Japanese government. Almost every school is identical to every other school, and thus viewers have built-in expectations about what they'll find to which the animators must cater.\nAs the high school setting is crucial to the formula of the show, producers often find ways to draw out the high school experience. Almost all shows start in freshman year. On Beverly Hills, 90210, an extreme case, the producers actually had the students go to junior year twice. Finally, the cast is often made to attend a California University to keep the group together.\nStereotypically, private schools are usually populated by extremely snooty smartasses with more money than they know what to do with. They also have to wear uniforms, and are usually single-sex. Public schools, on the other hand, are depicted as extremely poor, the children \"run wild\" and have dress codes instead of a strict uniform policy. As you can see, this sort of stuff is always heavily exaggerated because it's funny or dramatic.\nA word about school dress codes here \u2014 from the mid-90s to the early '00s, an entire trend towards stricter dress codes and uniforms in American public schools has developed, peaked, and largely died out with hardly any notice from the creators of fiction. There are a number of reasons for this \u2014 it started after the creators were out of school, the Real Life version of this trend was more common in elementary schools (and never even considered as an option by some 80% of them), varied clothing helps in characterization, the creators want their cast to look cool to teen viewers, the actors can't wear golf shirts and khakis without looking like computer salesmen \u2014 the upshot is, if there's a strict dress code in a fictional American public school, chances are it's a Compressed Vice and probably also a Chekhov's Gun. The common \"no-hat\" rule was put in place largely to deter gang activity in kids. It's one of the few consistently accurate depictions of modern high school, perhaps because having actors wear hats makes lighting difficult in live action and is hard to render accurately through 360deg in animation.\nIn Real Life, school buildings often have additions that are designed with little or no attempt to match the existing building inside or out, making it possible for two or more completely different-looking regular-classroom architectures to exist in one school. This seldom happens in fiction because 1) they think it would confuse people, and 2) there's often only one \"regular classroom\" set and its decorations, orientation and such are changed as set dressing for scenes set in \"different\" classes.\nHigh Schools of all kinds are the natural habitat of the Alpha Bitch and her Girl Posse, the Jerk Jock, the Sadist Teacher, the Popularity Food Chain, and numerous other hazards common to the teenage years.\nFiction tends to regard the High School and its students as central to the workings of the Universe. Adult characters will always look back on their high school years as either the best or the worst of their lives, and will remember every detail of their time in high school as if it had just taken place the previous day. This is generally not Truth in Television; most adults (or at least those who were not abused) barely remember high school, considering it as a relatively unimportant prelude to their real, adult lives. Other times they may hold an idealized vision of high school due to the Nostalgia Filter, blocking out all the stuff they hated about high school and only remember the stuff they liked. Despite this, high school is about the only experience that a majority of the adult audience is guaranteed to have in common, even if they failed to graduate.\nA subtrope is Inner City School. When the High School days are overtly idealized, it becomes High School Rocks.\nSee American Educational System for more information. For schools in Britain, see The Good Old British Comp.\n"}
{"FoxChickenGrainPuzzle": "A Stock Puzzle, subset of the Inventory Management Puzzle. You are a farmer taking a fox (or a wolf), a chicken (or a goose) and a sack of grain to market (don't ask why you're taking a fox to market) and you come across a river. The only way across the river is by a small boat, which can only hold at most you and one of the three items. Left unsupervised, the chicken will eat the grain or the fox will eat the chicken (however, the fox won't try to eat the grain, nor will the fox or the chicken wander off). What's the quickest way to get everything across the river?\nThe standard answer is:\nThis puzzle's primary difficulty to those new to the puzzle is in realizing that one must consider the possibility of taking an action that seems detrimental or a step back from their original goal in order to ultimately complete it.\nMay also appear with different animals and vegetables, such as wolves, sheep and cabbages. A \"jealous husbands\" (also known as cannibals and missionaries) variant has three couples trying to cross a river with a two-person rowboat, but none of the men will allow his wife to be alone with either of the other men on either side of the river (or, cannibals cannot outnumber missionaries, lest the latter attacked and eaten). This one can be solved in eleven steps.\nThis is an ancient puzzle. The oldest known example was found in Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes, which dates to the late ninth century.\nA more complicated version, but which operates on much the same principle, involves a barrier (usually a bridge), four people who all move at different rates, and some item that is required in order to cross the barrier (most often a flashlight). The puzzle is to get all the people across within a specified amount of time, which seems to be too short. Probably the most well-known version of this is:\n"}
{"CharacterMagneticTeam": "Some groups or teams act as a character magnet. The group keeps on attracting new members and/or close allies. In shonen anime, especially, a former villain of the Worthy Opponent class tends to become a new teammate.\nThis is often used near the beginning of a series to build the cast. When done well, this makes a character's entrance more interesting. When done poorly, it is an anvilicious way of adding a new character. If it's done often, it will ensure that your series will have Loads and Loads of Characters.\nSometimes, this happens to replace other characters in series with high turnover. Usually there's a Magnetic Hero at the center of the team, though other characters around him will also exert \"pull\" to attract newcomers.\nThis is the logical extension of the Debut Queue. Compare Hitchhiker Heroes, where the team is attracted to the new members. See also You ALL Share My Story for a similar phenomenon.\n"}
{"ThereAreNoTents": "In many a Role-Playing Game, the Player Character can't keep Walking the Earth and deal with Random Encounters forever due to running low on Hit Points or Mana Meter. Since a Healing Potion is best saved for emergencies, the easiest (and cheapest) way to recover is to visit a Trauma Inn and rest for the night (at any time of the day, since usually the game barely if at all keeps track of the passage of time).\nUnfortunately, the hero and their party can't just set up camp in the wilderness; the only place where you can get a good night's rest is at an inn, which of course costs money. The cost almost always depends on how far has the player advanced along the plot (or the character's level, in some cases). This can go to ridiculous extremes, such as \"inns\" in the middle of dungeons, to avoid getting in tents.\nA form of Resting Recovery, where additional restrictions are placed on where you can use that mechanic. Well on its way to being a Dead Horse Trope, as recent RPGs tend to offer characters more options to deal with resource shortage and often have faster-paced plots where taking off days at a time wouldn't be appropriate for the hero. Back in the day, however, it used to be a commonly used pacing mechanism, forcing the party to level up and get gear until they can survive a lengthy sequence between being able to recover. This mechanic can be used without involving inns or rest time at all, if the game has save points which trigger the same effect instantaneously.\nSee also the multiple exceptions below;\n"}
{"PaddleBallShot": "A trope exclusive to 3D movies. When making a film specifically for a 3D release, many filmmakers like to play with the 3D effects by making people and objects appear to reach out from the screen at the audience. More often than not it's simply done for its own sake to show off the 3D effects, but this can also be used to invoke a sense of danger, such as throwing sharp objects or driving cars right at the camera. The effect is unfortunately lost, however, when the film is eventually released on DVD in 2D, leaving viewers wondering why these characters enjoy shoving stuff into the camera so much.\nDepending on one's personal preference toward 3D movies, it can be seen as either using the medium to its full potential, or just adding a gimmick onto another gimmick.\n"}
{"AwardSnub": "The Oscars. The Emmys. The Grammys. The Tonys. The Golden Globes. The MVP. The Nobel Prize (Borges was robbed, I tells ya! Robbed!).\nThese awards represent the supposed apex of recognition for the creative, intellectual, and athletic arts, the validation of a person's years of hard work and creativity... a work's mark of superiority whatever the medium... recognition by both the establishment and your peers.\nSo why is it that so many artists and works, some even considered among the best of all time, have gone award-less?\nAn Award Snub is when a work or person is denied the acclaim of a popular award that it seems to deserve, through action malicious, unintentional, overly reactionary, out-of-touch, or anti-populist on the part of award voters. The reaction to the folks at home is the same: \"That didn't win? And that did?!\" It's a real life case of Dude, Where's My Reward?.\nOf course, it could also be for entirely innocent reasons. If two or more great works come up for the award that year, someone's going to have to be disappointed. There Can Be Only One, after all.\nIf an individual has gone for long enough with continued snubs, expect an award to be given (almost out of pity) for a recent perhaps-inferior work or at the very least, a life-time achievement award. For more information on that phenomenon, please see Consolation Award.\nIn the worst case scenario the unrewarded artist dies and (unless he/she completed something before their death that's deemed eligible and worthy) the voters never have another chance to make things up to her/him; posthumous honorary awards just don't exist. This is an unfortunate overlap with Dead Artists Are Better.\nSee also Vindicated by History, when the work or artist gets their honor long after the snub, as well as Public Medium Ignorance, which works that are subjected to this are prime targets for award snubbing. For when an actor is nominated for the wrong category, see Award Category Fraud.\nFor the hipster equivalent, see It's Not Supposed to Win Oscars.\nHeated debates on if a work was actually snubbed have often occurred and can also degenerate into Complaining About Shows That Won as well as Take Thats to shows that lost, so because of that we won't be listing such examples here. If you really want some ideas, check out these off-site articles about The Oscars, The Emmys, and The Grammys. See also the People's Choice Awards, which were created at least in part as a way of addressing/averting this.\n"}
{"PleadingTheHumanCase": "The villain, or The Great Gazoo, or just a misguided member of an advanced race comments on how weak/pathetic/cowardly/worthless (or just un-powered) humans are. \"Why do you care about them?\" Or the villain will be more direct and point out that Humans Are the Real Monsters and thus not worth saving.\nThis will lead into the hero responding with the Patrick Stewart Speech, in which he may concede that humans are weak (at least for the moment), but there is much that is noble about humanity as well. He notes that they have much potential, and he admires humans' capacity for love / friendship / loyalty / courage / persistence / whatever virtue it is the writers want to Aesop. If you hear the sentences \"There is much that we could learn from them,\" or \"We were Not So Different, once,\" you're likely in the midst of a Patrick Stewart Speech.\nNote this is not just defending humans out of a general respect for life, or even for sentient life: the Patrick Stewart Speech notes specific qualities of humanity itself which make it worth saving, above and beyond simply being a sentient lifeform. In short, Humans Are Special and Rousseau Was Right. One variant of this speech will praise our flaws instead, pointing out how in overcoming/fighting them we grow better and create beautiful things.\nWhen done well, can give the viewer a sense of pride. When done poorly, comes off as overly preachy, pretentious or even ridiculous.\nFor a lighter-hearted version, end the Patrick Stewart Speech with some relatively minor accomplishment of humanity: \"And they came up with jelly-filled donuts! How can you hate a species that invented jelly donuts? Have you tried these things?\"\nSo named because Patrick Stewart has delivered such speeches many times, both as Captain Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation and as Professor Xavier from the X-Men Film Series. (He was trained as a Shakespearean actor, after all.) Do note, however, that while the Patrick Stewart Speech is always superb, with a perfectly balanced combination of precise logic and emotional appeal, a five-minute Patrick Stewart Speech barely holds a candle to a twenty-second Whoopi Epiphany Speech, just in terms of pure wise clarity.\nSee also Kirk Summation, \"World of Cardboard\" Speech, and Intrigued by Humanity. Contrast Shut Up, Kirk! and Shaming the Mob. Compare So Bad, It's Good.\n"}
{"InformedPower": "\n\n\nIn many movies, the Big Bad would show off a weapon that he claims to have the potential to destroy the world. However, as the film goes on, the weapon may be charged or activated, but we never see its full potential. Many actionized family movies fall under this trope, simply due to Scenery Gorn and Monumental Damage being a tad too offensive for the Moral Guardians. While in some cases, it may be partly justified (The Hero stops the villain before activating it), other times, the villain for some reason deliberately avoids aiming his weapon at buildings, skyscrapers or etc. While some Scenery Gorn may be added in, we never see its full destructive potential, unless some Fanon adds a customised clip in. However, budget constraints from majority of the work's budget deticated to other stuff would also cause this.\nA subtrope of Informed Ability. Sometimes overlaps with MacGuffin. See also: Battle Discretion Shot.\n"}
{"SevenLeagueBoots": "A famous, often completely mythical, conveniently uncopyrighted-yet-instantly-recognizable item, pulled from the realms of history, literature, or legend (if not all three).\nExamples of this trope pop up frequently, and have occurred in any number of genres \u2014 comedy, drama, science fiction, historical fiction, fantasy, you name it. They can be spotted in cultures from the East to the West \u2014 and some date back surprisingly far. Some cultures have favorite items to use, such as the Holy Grail for the West or the Ame-no-Murakumo for Japan, but with modern globalization trends, we're seeing more and more stories pulling from others' usual lists \u2014 such as Japanese media like Neon Genesis Evangelion using the Lance of Longinus (a fabled item involved in the Crucifixion of Jesus).\nIt can be a weapon, a MacGuffin, or hell, maybe both if it's a mystical doomsday device. Sometimes the trope shows up as Imported Alien Phlebotinum (seen often, for example, in Stargate SG-1), sometimes it's a mystical object, and occasionally it's both. Sometimes startling revelations are to be had about the object, sometimes it's straight out of the legends, heck, maybe it's even reconstructed from the original's spare parts. Regardless of its distinguishing features in the story, though, what makes it a Public Domain Artifact is its origin as an item from the collective myths of man, with all their familiar symbols.\nThere's honestly no telling how long this trope has been around; while nowadays it's often used partly to avoid copyright infringement, it's been around much longer than the concept of copyright. Many authors (ancient and modern alike) have used these for the mythos attached to them, or simply because it's easier than inventing something out of whole cloth; if an author puts a supposedly mythical sword in their work, it needs to be supported, but when you hear \"Excalibur,\" it doesn't take any explanation to understand how important it is. See the example of Durandal below, Sword of Hector... then Roland... then reforged for Ogier the Dane. Later authors namedropped former heroes to make their mystical artifacts even more mystical, making this Older Than Feudalism.\nIn a series set in another world, these may appear, but under different names. They often function as a Plot Coupon; sometimes even entire sets of such artifacts will be used like this, leading to Gotta Collect Them All. In modern series, many of these items are made of low-grade unobtainium, especially if magic is downplayed or completely absent.\nThere's about a one-in-three chance that Hitler either had it or was searching for it. As the book Angels of Light and Darkness put it: \"If Hitler had half of what they say he had, he would have won the war.\"\nMay be related to Alternate Landmark History.

It may be called \"The Sword In The Stone\" which often has purists in a tiff; sometimes Excalibur and the Sword In The Stone are different swords, sometimes they're the same sword. Arthurian legend is a very sketchy canon. Occasionally called Caliburn or Caladbolg (when those aren't different swords) from the (possibly original) Welsh name Caledfwlch (literally 'hard gap/space', pronounced Cal-ed-voolkh, roughly).

It could also be associated with evil or insanity. One game studio has not only used it, but also the inscription on Ogier the Dane's sword Curtana, which reads My name is Cortana, of the same steel and temper as Joyeuse and Durendal. In The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Durandal is Excalibur, having been stolen by Orlando/Roland and renamed to not arouse suspicion (because even he knows it was kind of a dick thing to do).\nAnime & Manga\nLiterature\nLive-Action TV\nVideo Games\nTabletop Games\nReal Life\nAnime and Manga\n Video Games\n Anime & Manga\nMyths and Legends\nVideo Games\nThey are sometimes matched up with the four western elements.

The Stone is sometimes said to be the Stone of Scone, once part of the Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey but now housed in Edinburgh Castle but a few less-reliable sources say it's the Blarney stone in Ireland. There's also a standing stone in County Meath called the Lia F\u00e1il.

{"ReachingBetweenTheLines": "In television, phones are surprisingly convenient, but in cartoons, they can be even more so. They don't just connect two people metaphorically, they act as mini-teleporters between two places. Occasionally small objects can pass through, but just as often people put parts of their body through the phone line and make contact with the people on the other end (often to deliver some violence), or the phone take on properties of the event (such as growing a mouth).\nAs an example, if Dave has overslept for work, he might expect a phone call from his boss via a telephone which develops an enormous mouth and yells at him to wake up. It might then develop a giant eye to see that he's still in bed before the boss's upper torso appears from the line and shakes him awake. A grumpy Dave might then reach back through his phone and whack his boss, forcing the boss to pass his job notice form through the receiver.\nHow this works is never once considered. After all, if sound can be teleported over to the other receiver in an instant, why not other things?\nThis mostly seems confined to cartoons, although similar events have shown up in live action comedies from time to time, usually ones that don't confine themselves too closely to the laws of reality. Unless of course it's those scenes in particular that are not real. While there are more serious works where phones are used as transport focuses, this is about humourous uses.\nCompare Telephone Teleport (in which the character physically travels to the other end of the phone line rather than merely reaching out through it) and Television Portal (in which a video link is used in a similar manner).\n"}
{"YouMeanXMas": "Even if the Christmas Special is widely used, a few writers catch on that some stories take place in a setting where certain holidays and celebrations shouldn't exist in the original sense. So the characters celebrate a holiday that's (hopefully) just coincidentally similar enough to have the audience roll their eyes.\nDespite the eye-rolling, this can be a Justified Trope if the world of the story has solstices and equinoxes like our own, which would be logical times of the year to have a celebration.\nNaturally, these episodes are aired around the holiday they're really trying to depict, and sometimes may receive a name change in order to comment on them without raising the ire of Media Watchdogs.\nOccasionally, they use a real holiday that would make sense in the world of the series but isn't commonly celebrated among most of the target audience. For instance, the second-season Xena: Warrior Princess episode \"A Solstice Carol.\"\nNote that this trope only covers the use (or abuse) of Christmas or 'Christmas-ish' holidays in fictional, fantastical, or historical settings where the celebration as we know it would not exist; random other terms used for the holidays in modern settings should not be listed here.\nThis trope is named after the Christmas Special of Futurama, in which Santa Claus is actually an evil robot that kills everyone because he judges everything as naughty (except Zoidberg). The letter X (coming from the Greek letter \u03c7, \"chi\") has been used as an abbreviation for \"Christ\" (\u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2) for centuries. In modern times, however, the spelling \"Xmas\" is sometimes misconstrued as part of the supposed \"War on Christmas\" to secularize the holiday, literally \"taking the 'Christ' out of 'Christmas'\" by people on both sides of the argument. Also there are some people who come up with folk etymologies for the X such as that it means 'Criss (cross) mas' (as in the onomatopaeic description of drawing an X) and are genuinely surprised to learn about the Greek letter.\nThey may have a tradition of caroling. Compare Crystal Dragon Jesus, Uncoffee, Call a Rabbit a \"Smeerp\", Fictional Holiday, Santa Clausmas. Opposite of Everyone Is Christian at Christmas.\n"}
{"OnionTears": "Just like pepper can make you sneeze, in fiction onions and especially the act of peeling them can produce oceans of tears, looking more like that all your family has died than like the mild eye irritation that occurs in boring Real Life. Oftentimes in fiction onions will make the characters appear to be actually sad, and make loud weeping noises, rather than just leak a bit from the eyes. Of course, in Real Life, if the onions are green or very fresh, they can produce the copious tears, often accompanied by sniffing (because your tear ducts and nasal tubes are connected), but not the sobbing (although sometimes, the tears and sniffling can make you congested, forcing you to breathe through your mouth and send you even one step closer to the appearance of sobbing.)\nThis has several useful applications for those with something to hide: either you can disguise your real tears of pain by grabbing some onions to peel (compare Sand In My Eyes), or you can use onions to get tears in your eyes and simulate real pain when you don't feel it. It makes you wonder why this wasn't used in film production.\nVaguely related is the situation in anime where a character simulates crying while not-very-subtly holding an eyedropper bottle. Apparently only the audience can see it, though.\n"}
{"APCs": "Sometimes in war, neither the Cool Car nor the Cool Tank is enough. You need something that can carry The Squad into and out of battle and even fight alongside it if need be. How do you do this with a simple Armored Personnel Carrier? Easy, slap some more armor on it. Give it a BFG or three and maybe even the ability to crush other things like a tank!\nEnter the Awesome Personnel Carrier, the all-around badass vehicle not just meant to be an overpriced and underarmored taxi. In modern warfare settings, expect these to be ripped off from the BMP and M2 Bradley series of vehicles or some of their relations. In sci-fi settings, this might incorporate more elements of the Cool Tank or have an exotic unloading method, or even take it Up to Eleven by being a Drop Ship.\nSpecial mention should be given here as to terminology. The term IFV denotes Infantry Fighting Vehicle, as in a vehicle that directly engages and suppresses the enemy while the squad does its thing after exiting the vehicle. An APC, or Armored Personnel Carrier, simply shuttles the squad to and from battle. It might not actually do any fighting whatsoever. But that doesn't mean it can't be cool on its own. APC is commonly used to cover both types of vehicles despite this being incorrect, although the line between armed battle-taxi and light IFV can be quite blurred.\nNaturally, compare Cool Tank. Merkavas cheat by being both, and the Russian Mi-24 Hind ups the stakes again by flying. If the APC often gets confused with an actual tank you've got Tanks, but No Tanks.\n"}
{"RichJerk": "Snide, contemptuous and ever-so-superior to coworkers or neighbors, the Rich Bitch is the character you love to hate.

She can be especially vicious to men pursuing her who are not up to her sometimes impossible standards. Too much money has made her evil.\nSometimes the Rich Bitch actually has a heart of gold, and her behavior is either habit or a defense mechanism, but this subspecies is rare.

If The Complainer Is Always Wrong then this is a chance to have Fire-Forged Friends.

If it's more about their perspective, they'll often go out of their way to prove they're worthy.
